If I HAD to choose, I would pick the stuffed mushrooms as the top appetizer, but they were all phenomenal to say the least. The peach white sangria was also extremely tasty!My only disappointment was that the \"build your own Bloody Mary\" bar was only open for their brunch menu and not offered at dinner.

We love the food, and the atmosphere. Recently there was a bit of a mix up with our reservation. We waited about 15 minutes after we had arrived and I guess no one knew we had a reservation at 8pm that we were on time for. They asked us if we were waiting for a seat or a party and we said we had reservations at 8pm and the hostess told us to wait and someone would seat us and that no one ever came to seat us. They apologized, and sat us immediately. Also gave us free appetizers, and also free dessert. The manager even walked the dessert out to us and apologized again. I felt bad because really we had only waited about 15 mins to be seated - not too big of a deal but they went above and beyond to make it right.

I just hate the idea of paying $8 for a couple of shrimp that everyone has to fight over and being the polite one, I go last and get scraps but then have to split the bill evenly. So, the last two times I've been here, I've ordered my own plates. But that still means I'm spending $30 on two skewers of meat, and a glass or two of sangria. I admit the portions here are a little better than some places, though I think this place is hyped up a bit more and so is more expensive than maybe Cafe Iberico which has even better portions and prices. The service was slow, and yes they were busy, but so were we. We needed to eat and get out and go do something else. I was waiting on one of my skewers until the very end of the meal when everyone else had pretty much finished eating and I was sitting waiting without any food in front of me.

Idk what it was because I love pork, and this thing has 3 kinds (pork belly, roast pork, and some sausage), but it just didn't do it for me. I didn't love the flavor of the paella.

The flavor was absolutely off to the point where we politely told our waiter that we did not care for it. I never send things back, but this item being the most expensive thing we ordered, we couldn't keep it (or wanted the left overs for that matter) So I told the waiter in the most apologetic fashion if he could take it away. He was SO GRACIOUS and omitted the paella from our bill. He apologized and asked if we wanted to order something else, which we did. We were so thankful for his kindness. He also provided us with two free desserts. THIS IS HOW YOU GET RETURNING CUSTOMERS. Nice job Caf\u00e9 Ba-Ba-Reeba, you know how to treat people.

Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does their versions very well.In a group of 8, celebrating a birthday, many of the tapas were sampled and many drinks were to be had. Four of us split a pitcher of peach sangria, which was very good, each of us got two full glasses and there was a little top off to spare. As far as the food I personally took bites of:Bacon wrapped dates (5/5)Steak skewers (4/5)Spicy Potatotes (4/5)Fried Green Peppers (3/5) andPaella Valenciana (5/5)Braised short ribs w/mashed potatoes (5/5)Dessert - Chocolate Truffle Cake (3/5)You can't go wrong with bacon wrapped dates. The steak skewers and spicy potatoes were more impressive because of the sauce pairings. The fried green peppers were good, just not much to them, not a punch in the bite like I like my tapas. The paella was my favorite paella ever, mostly because paella usually comes with seafood and this one did not. Also it was done well. The braised short ribs I got to myself and every mouthful was very succulent and exactly like I would have wanted and was expecting. The chocolate cake was standard, nothing impressive, but good all the same. Service was around, clearing plates and making sure we got what all of our orders. Very impressive, especially since the concept of tapas induces a higher service standard than restaurants with the normal three plates.I can't wait to take the Mister here to show him how to eat like we do in Espa\u00f1a.", "Date": "2014-05-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jessica A.", "ReviewID": "c43uKIeGVq8OAaMtJeknaw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tapas is becoming the new thing!!

We weren't too hungry to begin with so it was the perfect restaurant to come to where we can just order a bunch of small plates and try a little bit of everything. First off I would come here for their sangria alone!!! We ordered a pitcher of the white peach sangria and omg I was never a fan of sangria but this place changed my mind. They put actual pieces of peaches and apples so it tastes even more fruity and delicious. The ambience is very romantic, dim lighting and lit up lights on the ceiling, I loved it.The food we ordered - goat cheese croqueta - this was just okay. I wouldn't get it again, nothing specialDeviled egg bacon and mustard - again nothing special. My bf said we had to try the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer but we forgot to order it :( maybe that will be more satisfying than the appetizers I ordered The shrimp with olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes - I think we coined this one as our favorite it was cooked perfectly, with just enough oil and garlic yum!!The braised short ribs with mashed potatoes - the short ribs were very soft and kind of just melted in my mouth. I'm a big mashed potatoes fan so I enjoyed this dish as well. Chicken with some type of vegetables - eh this was just okay, the chicken was a little dry but I liked the veggies :)There was also a lamb special that night, all the meat they have here is very tender and just melts in your mouth!!

(And it was perfect, by the way.)Yes, married. We didn't have just the reception here, we also knocked out a 10 minute ceremony after which, we opened the bar to our guests because, priorities.I was waiting for pictures from our photographer but I wanted to Yelp CBBR while the day was still fresh in my mind.A little back story, my husband proposed to me in August of 2013 - we knew we wanted a short engagement and literally just picked the weekend after my birthday in March (3/15 to be exact). After we got engaged and waited about a week, we already knew that CBBR would be it, we love the restaurant and the food and the tapas/family style plates and casual atmoshpere. Picking CBBR was just as easy as saying yes to him. Sure we had other places in mind (Carnivale, Tapas Valencia) but CBBR was more us. And it was important to us that we keep it personal, like we were just throwing a party. Traditional we are NOT. Plus, communication with CBBR was timely and friendly, which matters when you plan a wedding 6 months away.From the moment I reached out to them about my possible party size (Was: 75, Actual: 125), to the day of - the communication and service was just wonderful in a word.Alison and Ashley are some of my favorite people ever. My wedding day went off without a hitch because the entire staff is amazing. Literally amazing. We wanted to pay for everything before the wedding day because who wants to think about that when you're getting married. And it was so easy, and they ran our card for the final payment like we asked and let us know once they did. They think of everything before you do, which comes in handy if you're a frazzled, busy bride.We wanted something low-key obviously, and we didn't even realize we picked St. Patty's weekend for our nuptials. So many other patrons stopped my husband and I for pictures and we can't even begin to explain how much fun our guests had. So many guests commented on how this was \"the best wedding meal of their lives,\" which meant a lot to us because we obviously love to eat haha. In fact, we got a wedding card yesterday from friends who added a PS in the card: \"We had so much fun at your wedding we forgot to put the card in the box!\"That's all we wanted after all, to make sure our guests have a great time. Alison is so flexible and accommodating it was literally so easy to plan this with her behind the scenes. Also, she is so sweet in person (and in email but you know, email is your first point of contact!) We literally upgraded our bar package a week before the event and it wasn't even a big deal, they were both just like - SURE NO PROBLEM! In fact, my head count kept changing and I would just shoot her an email the week of and she would just thank me for me letting her know.Ashley was there on the day of and always made a point to check in with me at every part of the day. She even brought me sangria refills too! So thoughtful. We actually dropped off our items the Friday before the wedding and they took care of everything, put programs at every place setting and literally (with the help of our friends/coordinators) gave us the day we dreamed of, better actually. So sure, a restaurant wedding isn't for everyone. But this wedding was exactly us. My husband and I cannot wait til our one year anniversary. We're going to dinner at Cafe Babareeba and spending the weekend at the Four Seasons Chicago to re-live our wedding weekend just as it was. Thank you so much Alison + Ashley for giving us the wedding day that was better than Rith and I could have ever imagined.

Literally nothing I've tried here has been below amazing. Some of my personal favorites are the following:Potatoes Bravas - Sauce comes on the side so you can decide how much spice you want. Potatoes are super crispy, just the way I like them!Beef Tenderloin with Blue Cheese and Potato Chips - The beef is super tender, cooked to medium, and the blue cheese is the perfect accompaniment to this. The chips are homemade and add a good crunch to the dish.Shrimp in Garlic/Olive Oil - They are always cooked just right - not rubbery like most places tend to do. They are simple and delicious.Goat Cheese w Marinara - The toast points are garlicy and cripsy, the goat cheese is soft and the marinana sauce is seasoned to perfection.Meatballs - There are about 5 meatballs, all pretty pretty, so it's a good size tapa. They are tender and I believe they use the same marinana sauce that the goat cheese comes with.Lamb Kabobs - These are super flavorful! There are three in the dish and they have been grilled and marinated for deliciousness. They taste similar to indian kabobs but more tender and come in a tomato sauce!Pincho de Pollo y Chorizo - My favorite Pincho de Pollo is at Cafe Iberico, but this one is delicious as well. It comes with a sauce that I wish i could make at home. The chicken is grilled, as well as the chorizo. It's pretty basic but really great!Sangria - They always have a bunch of different types to choose from. I've never had a bad one, although I do wish they were a little stronger ;) You also can't go wrong with a bottle of wine!Carmelized Banana with Ice Cream - This is always my favorite dessert! The carmel is roasted on top of the banana to create a crunch, and the warm banana/carmel is paired with a vanilla bean ice cream, which is just heaven!The service is great here, especially since they are always jammed packed! The ambiance is great for bigger groups or double dates.

Tapas are small dishes that are meant to be shared. Usually, you should order 2 - 3 dishes per person. Each dish can be between $6-12 depending upon what it is. Things can add up pretty quickly but the food is so worth it. Our waitress, Marilyn was exceptionally nice. She understood when ordering, we would appreciate it if only two dishes came out and not all at once. She timed it so there was a heavy dish paired up with a lighter dish. Our dishes complimented each other in taste and they didn't fight against each other. The only time we were stumped was when it came time for desserts. I opted for a chocolate truffle cake. It comes with kuluha and a dollop of whipped cream. I can hear my waist line popping. So worth it. I'll run on the treadmill for an extra hour. Yes, it's that incredible.

At this location, you pay for the abundance of flavors and that is okay because quality is more important that quantity some times. The servers were really nice and always asked if we wanted more. I wouldn't say they went beyond or were exceptional, but they were decent. Lastly, the desserts were really delicious too. Once again, they are small, but one bite of it is enough to fill your entire mouth with flavor.

I texted my best friend who confirmed she was ALSO charged $80.67. So I'm wondering since when does a restaurant charge double the check? My BFF called and spoke to a manager who apologized and gave some explanation about how their system always does that when you pay with a credit card but it should clear up n a couple of days. In my opinion, customers should be informed in advance because its a inconvenience to put a hold on someone's money.

I easily could have eaten the entire plate-Seared bay scallops - they could have used a bit more of a sear on them, but I still devoured my share and could have eaten more-Splcy Potatoes - the heat sneaks up on you, which is wonderful. I'll be attempting to make these at homeWe also got the White Sangria. The first glass was excellent, but after time, it became a little too sweet for me. Thankfully the server was spot on when it came to refilling my water, keeping me hydrated and allowed me to finish the sangria; because, let's face it, you can't waste sangria.Definitely make a reservation if you're coming.. there was quite the crowd hanging out waiting for a table.", "Date": "2014-01-13", "Author_Location": "Indianapolis, IN"}, {"Author": "Yasmin C.", "ReviewID": "S5vNDrt6XUlp7eB16IoMzA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hmmmm, I found the food strangely average during my dinner here.

Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, hint of garlic and a slightly sweet after taste. mouthgasm at its finest. 4.

If you live near walking-distance or are above the law, try all three pitchers! You wont regret it (maybe later).There are these pork ribs that are some of the best I've ever had! They satisfy all of rib criteria: crispy shell WITH a glaze + a true fall-off-the-bone texture. These really dont need any tooth effort for separation. Someone could pass gas in your general direction and the force of that small current of pleasant air could send the meat FLYING off these bad boys.Spicy tomato aioli potatoes are a must at these places. Loved it. Again, crispy outside and soft center in that sauce.Beef tenderloins w/ blue cheese + potato chips. I'm quite sensitive to blue cheese so I typically dont like ones that are super strong and overbearing. Here, they've got that balance between the cheese and the beef. Remarkably good!Rioja-braised short ribs broke apart when introduced to the fork. They nailed this one!Other dishes that we tried were the croquetas (get em all!), short-rib stuffed peppers, fried calamari, and empanadas (get em all!).

First, we were seated by a bus station in the middle of the room - I was closest to it at 3 ft away.I know we can't all sit far away from the bus stations, and I was fine with it, but the staff made NO effort to avoid hitting my chair, no matter how I tried to re-position it away from them. I finally had to hold my purse in my lap after a staff member knocked it off my chair, tangled it up in his feet, stepped on it twice and then kicked it 4 feet away - all without ever looking down. I politely brought the incident to his attention and, without any comment whatsoever, he simply walked away from me. My fellow ladies at the table we appalled - I'm pretty sure the men didn't even notice. Either way, the lack of an apology is unacceptable.The food was okay, if maybe a bit blah, and the serving of it by the busboys was total confusion. The wrapped dates are good (#1 & 67, 67 is better), and the spicy potatoes (#30) are okay. The shortrib stuffed pepper (#4) tasting was great. The empanadas (#52 & 62) are meh - I've had better. The pork belly with beans (#68) was a huge disappointment - it was 99% fat and totally inedible IMHO. The olives (#26) aren't worth $5.The sangria is fantastic, I will give it that.

We had a reservation on a Wednesday for 6 PM and we were seated immediately. The restaurant did not full up until around 7 PM, so it turns out that we did not need reservations. I have heard that weekends are a different story entirely, but my weekday experience was that it was not crazy busy. We were seated toward the back next to a mirror (one whole wall of the restaurant is a mirror to give the illusion of a larger size). I noticed right away that there suble, classy Christmasy decorations that created a very inviting and cozy atmosphere. I could not stop smiling from the start to the end of my meal!Our waiter was cordial and helpful in explaining the menu to us, as well as how tapas work, after we informed him that this was our first time dining at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. We ordered the seafood paella for two for starters after our waiter informed us that would take the longest amount of time to be ready (30-40 minutes). We also ordered a glass of the classic red sangria to share. (Okay, mostly for my boyfriend. I don't really drink, so I just took a few sips of his because I had never tried sangria before.) I have nothing to compare it to exactly, but I thought it was delicious and certainly more enjoyable than red wine by itself (in my un-wine-cultured opinion). While waiting for our seafood paella, we did not hold back at all in ordering small plates of tapas. We kept ordering and ordering and the food just kept coming and coming!My boyfriend had the roasted dates wrapped in bacon with apple vinaigrette and he said it was so good that I tried a tiny bite (I'm pescetarian). Sure enough, it was absolutely delicious. The flavors worked perfectly together. Next, we had the pintxos platter with the short-rib stuffed piquillo pepper, bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, chorizo-wrapped medjool date and cheese, goat cheese croquette with lemon gastrique, roasted beet crostini with herbed goat cheese and hazelnuts, deviled egg with bacon and mustard. The goat cheese croquette was my absolute favorite with the shrimp in a close second. Next, I had the market greens salad, with chili-roasted corn, tomato, cucumber, avocado, goat cheese, and fresno chili vinaigrette; grilled squid on arugula with olive oil and garlic. It was fairly straightforward, but truly excellent. The salad was a great break from some of the other heavier tapas I ate tonight. We also ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, which were simply divine. I was skeptical when I first read the description on the menu, but boy, was I wowed! By the time the seafood paella arrived after ~20 minutes, we were stuffed with tapas. I barely made a dent in my portion, which was pretty large. It's hard to say if it was because I was quite full or not, but I was not as impressed with the paella as I was with the tapas. The dish could have used a bit more flavor and the rice seemed a bit undercooked, which makes sense given it arrived at our table earlier than the waiter originally said it would. However, the calamari in the paella was of very high quality and I enjoyed it a lot!After clearing our plates, our waiter brought us complimentary desserts because it was our first time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I pretended it was because it was my birthday. There was no way I was going to turn down free desserts, even if I was very full from all of the abovementioned food. The coconut flan was the best. Simply The Best I Have Ever Had. I would make the trip back *just* for that flan. The other dessert was caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios. The presentation was cute and it was quite delicious, though perhaps a bit too sweet with the quince syrup. This was my first tapas experience, but now my expectations are quite high. My only real complaint, apart from not being blown away by the paella, was that the tables are pretty close together and it was easy to hear the entire conversation of the table right behind us. I should also mention that the portion sizes were pretty large. My boyfriend, who has had tapas before, observed that the portions were much larger than other tapas places he has eaten. We left with leftovers, full stomachs, and big smiles.

Our first round was: bacon wrapped dates, fried calamari with jalapeno aioli, baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, and the beef medallions with potato chips. The bacon wrapped dates had SUCH great flavor! All bacon-y from the first bite, but the finish was with the deep sweetness of the date. It's a great flavor combo. The jalapeno aioli was absolutely wonderful with the calamari. It had a nice heat to it, which I would expect! The beef medallions were succulent and had a little bit of bleu cheese on them, but not too much, so it wasn't overpowering. The potato chips were fine, but I'm not a plain potato chip person. The goat cheese came with some crostinis to spread it on and they were perfectly crisp without being too hard to bite into.Our second round was: asparagus with manchego cheese, the mushroom, onion and arugula flatbread, and spicy roasted potatoes. The asparagus was perfectly cooked and had a great grilled flavor to it, especially on the tips. The flatbread was very tasty, but I felt it was missing something. Maybe a tiny sprinkling of lemon juice or a vinegar reduction. The spicy potatoes were just roasted potatoes with some kind of spicy mayo which wasn't spicy. I was disappointed with that one. When you say \"spicy\", I WANT SPICY. Third round was dessert: caramel almond bar with a butter crust, and the butterscotch pot de creme. Heaven in my mouth. I had to take a few bites despite the fact that I am allergic to dairy, and it was worth the digestive counterattack. That butterscotch pot de creme was topped with a thin layer of a salted caramel sauce which complemented it perfectly. The best way to eat the caramel almond bar was to take a bit and chew it slowly while it melted in your mouth. Then all the flavors really popped out before you swallowed it.

We stuck with the original!)Some of my favorite tapas dishes were the bacon wrapped dates; the flavor is unexplainable but bacon is worked in there so you know it's good.

From the beginning, we had to flag down the busboys to alert the waiter to even give us our menus. This continued throughout our meal, and we barely ever saw our waiter unless he was placing the dish on our table.Also, they were having some catering event that day, so behind our seats there were waiters rushing out of the kitchen moving around heavy trays and carts.

I am glad I did.Went in on a very busy Sunday evening. Place was full and we were seated in back. I was a little worried that we would get forgotten back there but I was wrong about that. Unlike the last time, our waiter was outstanding. Wish I remembered his name. Tall skinny white guy. He never left us too long but didn't over do it either. The bus boys were on it too: Waters always full and plates always quickly cleaned. Full water is something I am soooooo picky about.Now on to the food. Uh, yum. My husband is a baker and is always extremely critical about bread. He LOVES the bread here. To start we ordered the wood roasted pepper, eggplant and tomato spread which was delicioooooousss!!! I could have ordered more but after receiving it and ordering a ridiculous amount of tapas I just couldn't.I ordered the citrus cured salmon thinking it was one I had last time and they had no problem switching it for the one I thought it was. That grilled salmon & pesto is on point. One thing I adore about this place is the sauces, and my husband agrees. Fish was cooked to perfection.Apple spinach salad w/ quinoa was ok, nothing special. Could have used a few more apples. Needed salt or more acidity. Wasn't bad though and perfectly dressed. \u00a0Chicken empanada wasn't as good as I remember it but I think that was my pallet with the other items. He enjoyed it.Lamb Kabab: Great flavor and juicy. Sauce was bomb. As usual I love love LOVED the stuffed mushrooms. Great flavor and a nice crunch on top. Those patatas bravas. Um, yum. That sauce. Lord that sauce.Husband really loved the shrimp with garlic and ended up dipping bread in the olive oil marinade it was in. I wasn't in the mood for shrimp so I didn't have any but he said he loved it. For dessert I had the butter scotch which was great!!! Loved it. Hubby ordered a kids portion of the churros. We both preferred them alone without the chocolate sauce. We also had two cups of coffee but GASP $3.25 for a small cup! I found that to be a little expensive.Overall I had a great dining experience and will definitely be back.

First, it was really, really loud so conversation was difficult. Second, the floor was so super slippery that I almost fell twice just walking to our table--no sexy swagger for me. Heels and a slick floor=bad news. I mentioned this to the hostess who said, \"Yes, the floor here really is slippery. It gets worse as the night goes on.\" Ew. What does that mean? I don't want to know what makes the floor slippery over the course of an evening--especially right before I am about to eat there. Third, the sangria was nothing to cheer about. On the other hand, the food was great. We picked a handful of things to try and each one was delicious. Empanadas, Goat Cheese, Sausage, etc., it was all really good.

With smaller portions sizes and high prices, it takes a lot more flavor wowness to deliver overall value. This place had some great dishes but just didn't quite get to 4 star status. Lamb kebab- pretty good. Doesn't really stand out really from a standard seasoned meat dish. I didn't find myself reaching for a second one after the first. Spicy potatoes- These definitely had the \"oh wow\" factor. These taste so so good and have a strong kick that surprises you in the end. Definitely getting this again. Bread spreads: Yea, good. Not amazing. But good. That pretty much sums it up. Cured meats platter (called something else)- I really like this. The prosciutto and the salami were great. There was just enough for everyone to get a slice of something at our table, I wish we had ordered a second one. Bacon wrapped dates- There are a lot of very favorable reviews for these and the waiter enthusiastically recommended it. It was ok but I think I just need to admit to myself I'm not a fan of dates. I've tried several supposedly amazing date dishes at several restaurants but never really enjoyed any of them. If you like dates, maybe this dish is good. If not, this dish won't change your mind. Chicken paella- Again, good. Nothing special. Overall it was a good meal with good sangria.

Cleaning off my coffee table for the first time in months (that's what watching a marathon of \"Hoarders\" will do to you), I came across a gift certificate that was earned by attending the New Years Day Pajama Brunch at Ba-Ba-Reeba. Since it was expiring in November, I figured it was time to get off my duff and use it, and since I don't love sitting inside here and it was warm last night, my s.o and I made our way there to enjoy some tapas and sangria on their outdoor patio. He hadn't been there in years, and I hadn't been there since New Years, and to be honest, neither of us would have gone here if not for the weather and the lure of saving $25. To my surprise, this place still packs 'em in, despite tapas being rather pass\u00e9. This was one of the first (if not the first) tapas places in the city (not sure if Caf\u00e9 Iberico holds that distinction) and it's still going strong, so people obviously still go crazy for tapas. I can take 'em or leave 'em. We were lucky enough to snag one of the last remaining tables outside since we didn't have a reservation (which never occurred to me that I'd need) and our jovial server greeted us and we ordered a pitcher of red sangria while we decided what to order. Our server brought out our pitcher and asked us if we were on any time constraints so he could guide us accordingly and time our food. I thought that was a really nice touch and wonder why more servers aren't proactive. We actually had all the time in the world but we appreciated being asked nonetheless. The sangria, as always, is consistently good and refreshing. Appropriately sweet (but not cloying) and fruity, it went down faster than a $5 hooker. We selected a few tapas to get things going: ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, baked goat cheese, and grilled calamari. The tuna arrived first, and instead of tuna it was covered with chopped cauliflower. We both dug around and could find no tuna. The server came over and we showed it to him and he apologized and took it away to be remade. Once it came back correctly, it was very good. In fact, the server brought us an extra order of it, which was nice. I loved the smear of avocado on the crusty bread. The goat cheese is exactly the same as every other tapas restaurant on the planet; nothing mind-blowing, but satisfying just the same. I didn't really care for the calamari as it was rubbery and chewy and didn't have enough \"char\" for my liking for being grilled. We were still hungry so we ordered a mushroom empanada and the sirloin with shiitakes, asparagus and potatoes. The empanada was huge for a tapas, but the crust was flaky and the filling was earthy and had notes of sherry; it was delicious. The sirloin didn't have much flavor, and it was cooked as ordered, but it was a tough cut of meat, so I'm not convinced it was sirloin. The accompanying vegetables were fine; the asparagus was a bit woody and tough, but the mushrooms and potatoes were decent, as was the sauce. By then we were appropriately full, so we declined dessert and lazily sat and finished our sangria, lamenting the end of summer. All in all, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a perfectly respectable place to dine if you enjoy tapas.

You can't get much more authentic than that. I was instantly transported to Spring Break 2003 in Toledo. I half expected to see the chefs preparing my paella while smoking cigarettes with hanging butts on the verge of falling into my meal. Most Americans might consider that unclean, but I say it adds an additional smokey flavor to the cured meats.It was a friend-of-a-friend's birthday dinner. I was super excited she picked this place because I kept hearing wonderful things but couldn't bring myself to go without a good reason. I know tapas places are notorious for charging an arm and leg, which is as un-Spanish as you can get considering that tapas are traditionally served like cheap popcorn or peanuts in dive bars.We were seated relatively quickly and began our culinary crusade (too soon?) through the treasures of Espana. Naturally, we started our journey out right with a pitcher of passion fruit sangria. A pitcher of red and a pitcher of white, and I think another pitcher of red were also ordered during the course of this meal. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, but I would have liked it a little stronger and with a little more fruit. It might be considered too sweet for some, but I thought it was perfectly balanced.I was extremely pleased that all the guests decided to get in the true European spirit and split the food and the bill. It made things so much easier and gave everyone a little sample of most of the items on the menu. I'm ashamed to admit, but I ate: bacon wrapped dates, potato and onion omelette with some type of seasoned mayo, goat cheese in a tomato sauce with garlic bread, escargot with tomato and cheese atop buttered bread, pan fried squid, octopus salad, country style potatoes with a mild but bold red pepper sauce (my favorite), garlic potato salad and seafood paella bursting with fruits of the sea. The stuffed mushrooms looked and smelled amazing, but I loath mushrooms and didn't taste. My dining companions raved about them, though.The check comes and the number really smacks you in the face - $300. But then you realize that halfway through the meal you were about ready to burst. (I still don't understand why the majority of women there are wearing skinny jeans. I strongly urge you to wear a stretchy dress or pants with lots of elastic.) We had 11 people and picked up the slack on the birthday girl. They automatically added 18% gratuity, which saves me money since I typically do 20% but only do 18% to spite them when they hit me with mandatory gratuity. It came to exactly $30 per person. If I'd gone anywhere else I probably would have expected to pay that much for the sangria alone, so I think I got a great deal.

Really great. Must-try if you're a mushroom lover but even if not, the creamy sauce it's in and the filling might sell you.Croquetas de pollo y jam\u00f3n (chicken & ham croquetas): Melt in your mouth quality, and they're served with a sauce similar to tartar sauce that's pretty perfect.Bacon-wrapped dates: Pretty standard, still delicious.All of the above made for a REALLY fun night and I love that our waiter was dressed as Fred Flinstone but with fake boobs and a fake butt (?).

We were sitting in what we thought was a bit of a draft and we asked to move, even though it was pretty busy, and without a single roll of the eye, we were moved to a warmer area. Our server was very friendly and helpful, and that was much appreciated since none of us had been before. Now on to the best part, the food and drinks!! Drinks: We had to have the sangria of course! But here's the thing, my hubby and I are one of few who don't like wine. But we really liked the sangria! We had half pitchers of the peach and black raspberry. I personally liked the black raspberry better but both were yummy. Just so you know how much you are going to need to get tipsy, the half pitcher filled up all our cups (party of 4) and with about a cup and a half left to split among us. Two pitchers were good for us, we didn't want to fill up too much on liquids!It's Tapa Time: \u00a0Now I can only speak for myself because I couldn't try all the meaty tapas but by mmm's and ohh wow's that all my dining party was cooing on about, it seems the meat tapas were a hit too. The portion size was very nice, you could easily share with three other people and still have a couple of bites to yourself. They came out quick and were paced nicely. Cold Tapas: I had the green beans, roasted tomatoes and shallots. And it was excellent, the beans were crisp and everything was well flavored. I also had the asparagus with grilled red onions and red pepper. The red onions and peppers were really good but the asparagus lacked flavor, although cooked to just the right crispness. Hot Tapas: This isn't really a tapa but we had this wonderfully tasty soup that was carrot and orange I think..but don't worry it doesn't really taste super orangey, it had almost an Indian flavor to it. SO good! We also had fried green peppers and course salt. It was very good but know that it is spicy! And speaking of spicy, I also had the spicy potatoes with tomato alioli sauce. Ohhhh my oh my! This was my favorite savory dish! \u00a0It was sort of spicy but not so spicy that I stopped popping those spuds in my mouth. And the great part was that it was literally a mountain of potatoes and it was plenty to share and still have tons left for me! Now onto my favorite part of any meal...the sweet stuff! Dessert Tapas: We all split three desserts and if I had my way, I would have had one all to myself they were so good! We had the truffle chocolate cake, apple crisp, and the almond caramel tart. I have to say that the caramel tart was my favorite but the chocolate cake was a very close second, my guests liked the cake best though. They are small servings and a bit cheaper than the other tapas, so make sure to order a couple! Save room because I feel like these tapas were the highlight of the dining experience! All in all, a great place to go, especially if you love variety in your meal. A really fun experience and a great place to take out of towners and family. If you go with friends, just make sure you share nicely and be careful, it's easy to get carried away ordering lots of plates in a group, make sure you set a price or plate limit before you go in! :0) On the flip side, it can be a pretty cheap meal if it's just two of you because you can watch what you order easily. Ok, enough reading about it! Turn off your computer and head on over to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!

I had never changed a tire, so I was useless, my friend worked on changing it and a few passerbys helped.Fast forward a few years to last night. I'm in the car with my best friend. We had made rum and Cokes with 7-11 slurpees, stopped at my piercer's shop to chat, had attempted to go to Peace Fest, and decided we should eat something. I'm particularly good at finding the best places to eat, and I usually refer to my Yelp app as a point of reference as far as what's near and what's good per the reviews.

I had read up on it, bookmarked it, and was determined to go one day. Over 900 reviews and I wanted Spanish, so off we went.I had lived in Spain for six months, so I was so excited to see all the d\u00e9cor, complete with jam\u00f3n hanging from the ceiling and FC Barcelona (Booo) scarves above the bar. We opted to sit outside. The patio was decorated with pretty lights and they even had traditional Spanish street signs on the wall (Calle de las lechugas AHAHA) Upon the standard checking-in to Facebook, Foursquare and Yelp, deals popped up. At the time, checking in on Facebook got you a free order of baked goat cheese, checking in on Yelp got a free pintxo platter. Such a good deal! We first wanted the baked goat cheese but then saw the pintxo platter and went for that. I was originally going to get only that, but I ordered the special Green City Market paella while my friend ordered a garlicky shrimp tapas. We rounded it out with a pitcher of white peach sangria.I will say I was little put off by the waiter. He asked me if I had ever heard of pintxos, tapas and paella, I said yes, I lived in Spain for a while...and he still proceeded to explain what they were. Bro, I told you I lived there. I KNOW WHAT THEY ALL ARE.Anyway, so I lived in southern Spain, went to Barcelona once, but never got to try the pintxos, so I was excited to try them here. Separately, they are $1.50 and during certain times, they are only $1...all together they are $8.95.

I also think the chef ran out of vegetables because I saw carrots in it when there weren't supposed to be...and it was missing green onions. My friend's shrimp was good, although she was disappointed in the portion size and lack of spiciness - hey, that's Spanish tapas and food in general.My friend and I took an embarrassingly long time to finish our pitcher and the staff was nice enough to wait for us.A great place!

Am I the only one who thinks of the YOBAGOYA episode of The League when they come here? Yes? Ok, cool. Glad that's out of the way. So tapas bars. Or as I like to call them, \"Appetizers-R-Us.\" Generally, you're going to get the same experience at every one. You order the cheesy tomato sauce and pretend it's super fancy instead of deconstructed pizza. You order the something-cheese and potato croquettes and pretend it's not essentially fried cheese and french fries. And then you get a pitcher of sangria and pretend it's not the wine coolers you downed freshman year of college before walking around campus trying to find a frat party or morally bankrupt club bouncer. Hey, I like to pretend, too! It's way more fun than being a grown up. So in pretendland, tapas are a magic, mysterious food that makes you feel worldly. In reality, and especially for a vegetarian, tapas are just okay. They are excellent for sharing and make for a good argument in favor of splitting the check evenly. But I get a little sick from the carbs and cheese and grease and sugary sangria, so generally I reserve tapas experiences for when others insist on going there for birthdays or other big group outings. And in that limited realm where I'm likely going to have a good time anyway, I'm happy to do tapas. At least Ba-Ba-Reeba has a nice interior, assuming you like dead animal parts hanging above you at the bar and inconsistent floor levels begging you to trip.

Our stuffed mushroom tapas was STONE COLD when we got it and we sent it back. She provided no apology and didn't know what to do with our mushrooms that we had already cut into.

My highlights: The short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper (on the Pinxto platter) had a nice smoky flavor balanced by the mild pepper flavor. I also liked the Spanish cheese and quince (also on the Pinxto platter) just a very simple flavor of semi soft cheese and sweet quince.

All were spectacular, but I would have the spicy potatoes and roast dates with bacon & apple again and again. third course: paella We both had Shrimp, Sea Scallops, and Green Beans.

A good flavour balance from the honey sweetened dates, savory crisp bacon, and refreshing tart apples. My friend John quotes: \"Worth giving up your first-born child for.

Spicy potato with tomato alioli ($6) ---Nothing overly special about these potatoes, but the spicy mayo does give it a little extra edge.Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego ($9)---A great plate of curred meats.

I asked the server why the food tasted different, and she confirmed that there was a new chef.I found the food to be way too mayonnaise-y, greasy and lacking in flavor. This is what we had:--- Chicken curry salad: way too much mayo and not enough curry.--- Warm potato and onion omelet: This is served warm and used to be served cold. It is now way too oily.--- Spinach stuffed mushrooms: These were still very good.--- Mushroom and rice croquesta: Meh. Nothing to it.--- Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce: This used to be my favorite. There was so much grease swimming in this dish, I couldn't eat much of it.Their Sangria still remains to be awesome.

Be Warned.If you check in on foursquare, you get a free pintxos platter. A $9 value, pretty awesome deal. 6 bite size tapas for free! The goat cheese croqueta was one of my favorites. It was oozing and delicious. The mushroom and rice croqueta was also very good. The short rib stuffed piquillo pepper was too spicy for me, skip it. Let's face it, one reason people use Yelp is to see what to order. Here's some tips:#44 Shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes - Like a Spanish style shrimp scampi. Really delicious, a little kick of spiciness. Save the plate, the olive oil and garlic is delicious to sop up with your bread. #50 Beef tenderloin & blue cheese - So damn good. I wish I could have an entire steak of this, but unfortunately it comes with 2 small medallions. Perfectly cooked, it'll make your knees buckle. Must order. It comes with potato chips (homemade?) which are good to munch on but nothing to write home about. Not ideal for big groups, however, because of the small serving size. #53 Handmade Beef Empanada - Flaky crust with a beef filling. This was ok, but a single empanada for $6?? I've had way better empanadas from Lito's for $2.59 apiece. I went out on a limb and got this and won't be ordering this again. #68 Roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette - Best bacon wrapped dates EVER. Been recreated many times, but none better than these. For $5, sweet Jesus this could be my form of crack at that price. So good. #30 Spicy potatoes with tomato alioli - Glorified potato wedges? I had high expectations, a lot of rave reviews for these but I didn't think they were too special. Not spicy and were pretty much something I'd get from a breakfast diner. Plus, very filling. #32 Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce - I read a previous review from Jen B. that called this dish what it really is... deconstructed pizza. Very good for sharing with friends, but this is pretty much just a cheese spread with marinara sauce. I will say though, that this would be one damn good pizza. \u00a0The food came crazy fast. Additionally, if you fill out cards to join the Lettuce Entertain You email list, you get a free tapa. We each filled out a card and the server said he'd take off 2 tapas from our bill.

Endive SaladPretty good, except for these HUGE chunks of membrillo that would have served the salad better had they been cut into tinier pieces.2. Caesar Salad w/ Serrano HamTypical caesar salad, a little overdressed.3. Fried Calamari w/ Tomato SalsaThe presentation was horrible. It honestly looked like slop on a plate. The pieces of calamari were huge, and the breading wasn't consistent. It was probably some of the worst calamari I've had. Soggy and flavorless. Same goes for the sauce.4. Anchovies w/ Almond PestoOne of the better dishes. However, the texture of whatever cream sauce was paired with the pesto detracted from the dish. Everything else was crunchy and sharp-tasting, and the sauce was mushy, and way too creamy.5. Beef Tenderloin and Blue CheeseSeriously... \u00a0$11 for two tiny bites of beef and potato chips. What a rip off! Tasty, but I spent the rest of the meal feeling cheated.6. Braised Lamb with Spinach, Couscous, Marcona almondsProbably one of the more successful dishes. The flavors were all really good, but everything was over-seasoned. However, I do appreciate that the lame had flavor, which is something I can't say for a lot of the lamb I've had at other restaurants.7. Skewered Chicken & Chorizo SausageAll kinds of bland. Nothing out of the ordinary. Came with a mysterious dipping sauce on the side. Helped a little bit.8. Truffle (Chocolate Cake)Apparently, they fail to mention that the cake is flourless. Not bad, but neither a truffle nor a cake, really.9. Carmelized Banana w/ Vanilla Ice CreamScore. Finally something that surpassed average!Thus the 2-star rating. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"The service deserves a better rating, but I can't get over my disappointment with the food. My server was pretty damn good.

And this is coming from someone who rarely drinks alcohol. Didn't taste AS good as the sangria in Spain, but still very tasty.

I did enjoy their sangria. Granted, I still think I make the world's best sangria, but I was liking what we ordered. We started with their sangria of the day, which was a mango sangria, with white wine. Then we opted for the more traditional red wine sangria. If I had to choose between the two, I would say the mango sangria was more my style, but I've never been a red wine kind a gal, so maybe this is why.What I did NOT like: while this is a tapas restaurant, I felt the small plates weren't easily shareable. For example, we ordered the garlic scallops and, while delicious, we had to cut each scallop in half to have enough to go around. Also, the chicken empanada (which I did not eat), was literally one medium sized empanada which you also had to cut into sections in order to share. The pixto platter was annoying as well because everything was bite sized! So, if you happened to want that goat cheese croquetta (as I did), but some other member of your party who could not take a hint, also want that croquetta, we basically had to cut it in two. It was wholly aggravating but whatever. I got over and enjoyed my meal anyway.Two of my favorite dishes were the octopus and potato, and the paella. Unfortunately, there was very little octopus and a whole helluva lot of potato. Kind of a rip off, as I would have like to see more octopus. The same dish at Iberico is much more satisfying than here, but I still enjoyed it. I also (surprisingly) loved the seafood paella. Now, I lived in Spain for a year and have had my share of authentic, unbeatable paellas, and of course Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba isn't quite there yet, but it was damn good. Nice and creamy with a good dose of seafood peppered throughout the dish, this is a must order.Our waiter was on top of his game and the service was constant, with different waiters here and there bringing out our various dishes.

Spain also has the Mediterranean Sea and its incredibly fresh seafood to draw on...we in Chicago are not quite so fortunate. All of this is a long way of saying that I'm usually satisfied at best with American renditions of tapas. While its impossible to recreate the history, culture, and (dare I say) magic of tapas in Basque country, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does a more than passable translation right in the heart of Lincoln Park.I realize that this place is a bit of a scene, and while I'd normally opine more fully on the decor and service, I'm going to focus on food in this review which is the basis for the 4 stars I'm giving. Suffice it to say the service was efficient and the atmosphere lively, even on a Sunday evening. Here's what we tried:1. Chorizo-wrapped mejdool date & cheese: With good ingredients (which these were), this one is hard to mess up. Almost sweet & rich enough to have for desert, however, so consider saving for later in the meal even though this will likely be one of the first dishes out of the kitchen.2. short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper: an absolute knockout. Get more than 1.3. goat cheese, pistachio, mint and nispera preserves: sounded better than it was, which basically amounted to a goat cheese spread (could barely detect the mint or pistachio) with a very sweet fruit preserve on top. Wouldn't order again.4. salmon, celery root puree, kale chips & sea salt: not exactly your traditional tapas dish (last I checked, no salmon swimming around the Mediterranean), but delicious nevertheless. Salmon was perfectly cooked & seasoned, celery root puree was flavor & texture-wise spot on. Kale chips, though crispy and delicious, were not quite enough to add a textural contrast to the dish. Only a minor complaint, would definitely order again.5. octopus a la plancha, fingerling potatoes & olives: this is exactly the type of dish you'd expect to see as a hot tapas item in Spain, and CBBR executed this one perfectly.6. serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego: good but not great, and I say this mainly in comparison to the real deal (versus any other Chicago charcuterie, this dish totally stands up).Also had a pitcher of the traditional red wine sangria which was a bit sweet (read: not boozy enough) for my taste.All of this for $60 pre-tip and I felt like I had gotten away with at least a light misdemeanor.

I watched half a dozen girls (one wearing a tiara and sequined \"Bride-to-be!\" sash) gingerly navigate the stairs and thrilled with pride when I was pointed to the convenient bathroom, which was totally empty. Maybe the downstairs bathroom has TVs in every stall showing Sex and the City reruns...The food was Lettuce Entertain You-quality: inoffensive, surprisingly authentic-tasting in an obviously faux kind of way (Passionfruit sangria? Bitch, please.) and pretty freaking expensive. The people-watching is, obviously, transcendent, especially halfway into that second pitcher of sangria.

When we first walked into this cafe, I was convinced it had to be a chain restaurant b/c it looked so polished on the inside.

Also, the croquette of risotto and mushroom made me fall out of my chair. The perfect bite. - The escargot on toast with roasted red peppers was amazing. I have never tried escargot before but it was so tender that I have definitely gotten over the fear of eating snails. - Bacon wrapped dates. Nuff said. - The spicy pork dish. Kind of a miss in my book but I was pretty full by the time it showed up.

Then I actually spent time in Spain and realized that the best tapas are actually half way around the world, and to be honest, mostly every tapas place here has been a giant disappointment to me ever since. But given that tapas from Spain are no longer a daily option to me, I guess I just have to settle. The thing about Ba Ba Reeba is this: if you know your tapas, and you like things to be a little more on the authentic side, then look elsewhere; at least explore your options. The truth is, the little hole in the wall tapas place down the street from you, will probably be closer to how tapas should taste than anywhere else.

Had dinner here with my good friend Oscar last night, and we really went over-the-top. I let him do the ordering, and boy did he order some tasty dishes! I definitely rate it a notch better than Cafe Iberico and notches better than Emilio's, because of their variety of fusion dishes, cava sangria, and the ambiance was much nicer (better lighting too).Now, I'm no tapas connoisseur by any means, so I have no idea what constitutes as \"traditional\" tapas. However, I've gone to a few over the past few years, and I will say this has been my best experience at a tapas bar so far. Onto the food...I can't speak for the paella because we pretty much just stuck with tapas. I will say that we ordered a LOT of food, so I'll pretty much just review on the good (still a lot!). We began the meal with the pintxos platter. This was a great starter that comprised of: - chorizo-wrapped medjool date & cheese - ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast - goat cheese croqueta - short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper - padr\u00f3n pepper, olive cream cheese & pimento - mushroom & rice croqueta The chorizo skewer had a very crispy texture, slightly sweet, and the cheese ended the whole bite very creamy and yummy! The piquillo pepper was very tasty--that shredded rib was like a mini-pot-roast-good. The padron pepper with cheese was also very good, nice and creamy with a shot of heat. Next, we ordered some seafood and meat. I must say, the grilled squid felt like it was missing something...it needed good squeeze of lemon. However, the ahi tuna with meyer lemon, olives, capers, and tomato was just AMAZING. It had a slightly crunchy exterior with a very juicy and flavorful raw interior..and I must say, I've never been much into olives and capers because they can really overpower a dish, but the combination was perfect. There was a good balance of saltiness and sweetness from the olives/capers and tomato and nothing too overpowering. The beef tenderloin and blue cheese had that same balance of texture as the ahi tuna, but the blue cheese added yet another nice creamy and salty component to the beef. Finally, we had empanadas, a beef and chicken. Both empanadas were cooked in a very puff-pastry-like dough that was very flaky and reminded me of a dessert. It was actually a very good end to the meal because of that dessert-like pastry. Most empanadas I've eaten are usually wrapped in kind of a pie-dough, which makes the exterior not much to bite into. However, this empanada was flaky and the shredded beef had that similar pot-roast taste that really brought the empanada so much flavor. Now, the chicken empanada had the same puff-pastry exterior, but the chicken wasn't as tasty as the beef. I guess I can say it was good, but it didn't *wow* me.Finally, I *must* talk about their cava sangria. It was my first time trying a cava sangria, and I was first wary to try it because my friend compared it to a bubbly champagne (I do NOT like champagne). However, it was far from champagne--a good thing. In fact, it had a fresh, crisp taste, and I didn't taste the alcohol unlike a red sangria I've had at other tapas restaurants. There were also apples in the sangria, which I found very refreshing. We ordered a pitcher of the cava sangria, and it didn't disappoint (though, after three glasses, it definitely hit the spot!). The ambiance is great for a nice date, girl's-night-out, and just a great meal with good company. Definitely a classy place, but without all of the pretension. The music wasn't too loud, but definitely on the loungy-side. The lighting was dimmed down, but there was enough lighting to enjoy and showcase the food (I really don't care for very dark restaurants..makes me feel like I'm in a dungeon). The service was also good, our waiter was attentive but not overpowering. I'm most definitely coming back, probably with my family and friends.

The concept of tapas is foreign to many, and I was included in that many, but I've come to realize that sharing is caring. It doesn't hurt that with sharing you get to try a bunch of stuff, too!A meal at CBBR should begin with some sort of tasty beverage. Any of the sangrias are a great choice. But I'm a huge fan of the classic red and the mango sangrias [mango is a specialty]. We know the food is amazing [I'm determined to try every single tapas on the menu]. And some of the best tapas on the menu include the goat cheese in tomato sauce, citrus-cured salmon [YUM!!], braised lamb with couscous, and plato de casa.But the fun doesn't stop there, kiddies! The pinxtos are definitely worth a shot at least once, especially if you get the platter for free by checking in on Yelp!! But if you're ordering singles, go for the ahi tuna or the short rib-stuffed poblano pepper.And it keeps going and going...with paella. Order paella right away, as it takes quite some time to make. So decide quickly! I'd say that the seafood paella is my least favorite, and either of the other two are about even. Ask if they're serving specialty paellas that day, too. You might get a secret surprise!!If by the end of your delicious meal you can manage it, go for the dulce de leche tres leches cake. A-MAZ-ING.On the real, if you haven't already, download the Yelp app for your iPhone/Android device. Checking into CBBR twice [I believe] will get you a free pinxto platter. Yep, $FREE.99 for a platter. I love me some Yelp, man.**Sign up for the CBBR txt club, too. They'll txt you deals for free stuff, unless you hate getting free stuff.

While I don't think that there are many competitors, I challenge anyone to find better tapas in Chicago. Unfortunately, no one can, so the wait here is ludicrous or you just shouldn't try. I went to Babareeba last Friday with a group of seven. We weren't able to arrange for reservations ahead of time, and decided to put our names in. My friend first put our name in at 7:15Pm. We weren't seated until after 9Pm. With reservations, the wait isn't usually this long...I'm just giving fair warning.The sangria is a must. I love all the different types that they offer. Passion fruit is probably my favorite, but the regular red and white are very tasty staples. Our table ordered a bunch of plates to share. The complimentary bread is also far better than average. Normally, I list my favorite dishes and the dishes that miss, but I would be listing the whole menu under the heading \"delicious.\" The best approach is to come with a group of four to six people and try everything. Make sure to order the wood-roasted sweet potato bravas, rioja-braised short ribs, and the beef skewer with horseradish cream & red onions. Other favorites include any of the croquetas, the meatballs, and the spicy potato bravas. I'm not a huge fan of artichoke dip and the goat cheese spreads in general, so I would skip that but I know the rest of the table loved them. The paella is good, but I don't think that it is necessary for a delicious and filling meal.This past trip was the first time that I had sampled the desserts thanks to a free gift with yelp check in. Thanks yelp! We all LOVED the dessert. DO NOT MISS THIS! The desserts are small bites, so you can find room after stuffing yourself with the tapas. \u00a0I didn't think that a caramelized banana could be improved upon, but Babareeba's banana dessert is fantastic. The hard sugary topping is a nice touch. The Butterscotch pudding was definately worth a taste, but it is very rich. Everyone loved the Chocolate truffle, no one needed more than a bite....it was that satisfying and dense.I don't love the layout of this place, but I understand the need to cram in tables wherever they fit, especially since big groups and birthdays love this place. There are so many rooms and corridors that you can get lost going to the bathroom. While I love being seated on the recently renovated patio, I'm less of a fan of being seated I the basement. The BEST part of Babareeba was the bill. For a table of seven that ordered two pitchers of sangria and three rounds of tapas, our Subtotal was $19 per person!!!! One of our part even had a $10 off coupon. \u00a0Its definitely worth the wait to be promised such a fun, festive, and filling evening.

I usually hate to wait, but wifey gave me that \"look\" which I interpreted as \"For once in your f*cking life will you please wait.\" Hey, there was a bar, that was very well staffed, so I agreed. Within 10 minutes we snagged a few stools at the bar, and were immediately approached by one of the 4 bartenders they had working. We opted with the white Sangria, which was very tasty, and reasonably priced at $6 a glass.Exactly an hour later, as the Hostess promised, we were seated. Once again, the restaurant area was very well staffed. Our server was prompt, polite, and we never had to wait for water or a fresh glass of Sangria. We had a gift card, so gluttony seemed appropriate.

I think it's a great idea to combine lamb with the couscous and then something crunchy...so it doesn't get boring or too mushy.

Before you think \"Wow a food club. how impressive.\" It's not impressive at all. It's just a group of friends that want to eat, drink and try new places. Our 3rd official club meeting was this past weekend at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. We made rezzy's for 10 but of course 3 people bailed within 15 minutes of the time we planned to leave. The restaurant was really nice and didn't get huffy when we explained that a few people bailed at the last minute. Our service was phenomenal from start to finish. One thing that I especially appreciated here versus where we went last weekend (Girl and the Goat) is that you can order your tapas 1 at a time, whereas G&G they make you order everything all at once. There is no rush to get you out the door here. In fact, we were there well over 2 hours and the waitress didn't seem bothered by it at all. What we ordered:-1/2 pitcher of Peach sangria. At $14, it was a steal. One glass of Sangria is $7 and I think I got at least 4-5 drinks out of the pitcher. Tasted phenomenal.-Goat Cheese Croqueta Pintxo. A one-biter that was okay but I probably wouldn't order again.-Deviled Egg with Bacon Pintxo. Why don't my deviled eggs taste that good? So fluffy and airy. I wish I could figure out the secret ingredient!-Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. Pretty good but they taste like fried potatoes that I make at home. The tomato aioli was good, but not sure if I would get these again. My friend had these before and said she remembered them being better -- maybe it was just an off night?-Rioja braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes. So yummy! The mashed potatoes tasted like white cheddar mashed potatoes and were the perfect compliment to the tender, juicy short ribs. -Beef skewer and horseradish sauce. This was my favorite thing that WE ordered. The beef was extremely moist and the flavoring on the beef went perfect with the horseradish. \u00a0-Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo and manchengo. This was a cold plate of meat which we didn't realize when we ordered it. If we ordered it first, it would have been a great start, but we ordered it last so it was a let down.What I tried but didn't order myself:-Bacon wrapped dates- definitely my favorite of the night and a shame that I didn't trust the reviews and order them. Super tender and soft and one of those foods you could eat the entire plate and then order another.-Fried calimari with jalapeno aioli. I've never had calimari with anything other than marinara so this was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't greasy at all but still very flavorful. Another dish that I wish I ordered.-Roasted Chicken empanada. Pretty good and about what you can expect of an empanada, but compared to all of the other awesome dishes it wasn't brag worthy.-Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. This looked interesting when it came out and seeing the big ball of cheese in the center of some sauce made me apprehensive that it wasnt going to be special. It actually was very VERY good.Dessert:-Carmelized banana w/ toasted pistachios. Yummy! It was torched in the same manner as creme brulee so you got a nice crunchy topping along with the nuts.-Butterscotch custard cream. Me and several others at the table enjoyed this the most. It's basically custard with homemade butterscotch on top.-Churros with cinnamon and chocolate dipping sauces. I didn't order this but someone else at the table did. It was pretty good, but probably my least favorite out of all 3 desserts I tried.I was overwhelmingly impressed by everything that I tried. Nothing I tasted was BAD and I tasted a good portion of the menu. Our bill for food, dessert, tax and tip was around $70 which included 2 desserts, 4 tapas, and 3 pintxos.

The food was awesome, the lighting was mellow and romantic and the sangria was quite tasty. There were about 20 of us set up at a long table towards the back of the restaurant, so as the food started to come out things got crowded pretty fast. Several plates of our various tapas were spread out throughout the table so there was more than enough food to go around. We also had quite a few pitchers of red and white sangria spread around and the waitress brought us more bottled wine than we needed. I am fairly certain our menu was picked for us as we had little cards with our group and the food choices on it, and I have no problems with that. I am notorious for taking my time ordering so having someone choose for me is just the bee's knee's (or spider's elbow?). The endive salad was light and fruity, the chicken skewers and mayo-y dipping sauce were awesome, but the best of all was the spicy potato dish. On their own, those potatoes are great, but with the orange sauce that comes on the side they are about 10 times better. After about 5 or 6 rounds of tapas we were served two different kinds of paella. We had a veggie version and a chicken/pork mix. The vegetable paella was great. It was earthy and warm with a strong mushroom undertone. The chicken and pork, however, was awful. The meat did not taste or smell appealing and the texture of the rice was odd, a little too dry. The meal was finished with 3 disappointing little deserts. I know tapas have small portions, but I like my deserts in big portions! There was one of each dessert for about every 3 people so, the little mini-cakes were even less satisfying. My half-bite of chocolate cake from what I could tell was good. There was a nut-log looking tart? that was just not for me. I did enjoy my own little mini-flan and that was one of the highlights of the night. It was cooked perfectly and sat on a little bed of coconut flakes. Overall, great place with some extremely attractive ambiance going on and awesome food. The servers handled the group pretty well too. My lack of 5 stars comes from a bad batch of some chicken/ pork paella and not enough sweets at the end.", "Date": "2011-04-07", "Author_Location": "Romeoville, IL"}, {"Author": "Richa A.", "ReviewID": "_34F-HeR-0VFpZ2sXVABkw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great place for dinner tapas, or even better -- brunch tapas!

We didn't kick up a fuss and waited at the bar. What followed was spectacular service, beautifully flavored food and free dessert!!! Yes they said dessert was on the house for making us wait that long. We had two of the chicken empanadas, mushroom empanadas, spicy potatoes, goat cheese, octopus, short rib, market vegetables (from the specials menu)... and some other meat I don't remember. Everything was fantastic. The flavor was right, the portions were right. It was incredible. They also brought out the kiddies menus real fast and went out of their way to keep the kids entertained.

So why isn't there speakers in the waiting hall so when they call your name you can hear instead of blocking the entrance?Well we got up and waiting in the packed area surrounding the bar and next to the kitchen. It was so loud you couldn't even hear the announcer ask for the name waiting to be seated. It made me worried we wouldn't hear our name because they don't come and get you. Sure enough an hour later we ask and our table is finally ready.Now it was been raining for a week here and were seated outside which I was excited for until our table was on a rug near the portable kitchen outside for the servers.

Yesterday was a bit of a reunion and a nice night out on the town with old friends. I've become addicted to the Spanish cuisine for about two months now and knew that tapas would make for the best choice to go out for. Enter Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.I made reservations two days before and the restaurant was incredibly accommodating when we arrived early. No wait or hassle even though it was fairly crowded. We arrived early and were seated in what seemed like a party room, or just an extension of the main dining hall. As I walked through the restaurant, I loved the atmosphere and decor. It actually reminded me a bit of Disney World. Authentic, but in a playful way. I don't mean that as a bad thing! When seated we quickly ordered a pitcher of the Black Raspberry Sangria. It arrived quickly and I have to say, pretty tasty! A little too fruity and I didn't think it fairly strong, but I wasn't ready to get loaded.For food we went ahead with the spicy potatoes which were fantastic! I expected that, but I really enjoyed these. We ordered a second round! My friends got plenty of meat (!) including chicken skewers and beef. They really enjoyed it. I also went ahead with the garlic potato salad. Weird, not too bad. After a round of food we ended up ordering two more pitchers of sangria including the Mango and The Classic. I felt that after awhile the drinks dwindled in alcohol content. Fortunately I was having a blast and didn't mind it.So why 3 stars? For a table of five, we were obnoxiously cramped. The table was too small and our seats kept hitting other guests so much to the point that my friend continuously had to turn around and ask the guy to stop bumping her. Plus the menus are ginormous and knocked over a glass of my sangria (pre-drinking, mind you). The size really bothered me for awhile, but I got over it. With that said, I really enjoyed this place. Solid food, good drinks, and made for a great night out.

I can't help but comparing every dish and every pitcher of sangria to what I ate/drank in Spain. Admittedly, tapas bars in America are all white-washed and made to appeal to the masses. Sure, you're not likely to see too many sardines on the menu (I'm assuming not many would order them anyway) but what they do make, they make very well. So well, in fact, that I have walked 20 minutes through snow to get there - I'm from California, so you know this is a big deal to me!

The rest of the staff was quite friendly as well. BTW, the patatas bravas were to DIE FOR. For those of us who loved Rally's fries, they were like that but bigger and they came with a special dipping sauce. I don't know how I'm even surviving without having had those potatoes since I first tried them, but as soon as I get back to Chicago, I have a date with those potatoes.Deciding that I needed to immediately take up residence in the back of this restaurant, I used my Yelp app to check in.

They were so tender and the sauce and potatoes were a perfect addition to it. The last thing that stood out from the visit was the braised lamb dish. Again, the meat was very tender, the sauce was amazing, maybe a little too sweet for me, and the pine nuts and cous cous were amazing additions to the dish.Even though it was father's day, the dishes came quickly. Another bonus point was that the server was all too happy to tell us how to make the bacon wrapped dates at home. I can't wait to come back here and try their paella that my father was raving about, we couldn't because we had half of the lunch menu and their breakfast menu.

I feel like tapas always invite more food sharing, conversation, and laughter into a meal. If only every meal were tapas style, then I could feel less like a pig when I eat off of my boyfriend's plate.Anywhoo, let's get to the meal! Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has a large interior, but that won't stop them from filling up ASAP. Make sure you make a recommendation a few days in advance at least, otherwise you'll be waiting for a while. But wait! Want to eat a bit early and get your food for cheaper? Try to sit at the bar at any time between 4-6. The tapas are significantly cheaper (I think $3). No idea about the drinks but I'm sure they still have specials.We chose to forgo sampling their famous sangrias, because med school sucks and you can't have any fun ever. Oh..wait....shoot, there I go rambling again. The food had it's pros and cons, and there were definitely more pros. Pros: Great service. Our waiter was super attentive, gave suggestions, and wasn't overbearing. Water was always filled. He told us that usually 2-3 tapas per person is enough. We unfortunately didn't listen and ordered 7. Fooood comaaa.The goat cheese, pistachio, mint, and orange preserve jarras with bread was absolutely to die for. Tangy soft goat cheese melded with the crunchiness of the pistachios and the sweetness of the preserves. Couldn't get enough of this! Unfortunately we had to because it was a tiny jar. Sad faces. Boyfriend loved the taste of the lamb kebabs and said they were delicious. The not so delicious part? Getting two two-inch kebabs for $9. More Pro than Con: The mushroom and sherry soup, the sweet potato bravas, spinach and manchego mushrooms, and goat cheese baked in tomato sauce were just alerady. The soup tasted similar to traditional mushroom soup that I could make myself, and there really was no \"pop\" of flavor. \u00a0The sweet potato bravas were just sweet potato fries served with some kind of aioli. It said it was pomegranate aioli, but that must have been the nectar of the gods as far as I'm concerned. It was sweet and tangy, and perfectly complemented the sweetness of the fries. It may have been balsamic aioli now that I think of it. The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce was literally just that. A round of goat cheese in a traditional tomato sauce. Not worth getting unless you want something to dip your bread it. Comes with pesto bread as well that were alright. The filling for the mushrooms was creamy and delicious. The mushrooms themselves weren't seasoned well at all. I found myself eating the inside and leaving the mushroom caps. The cons: The spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. The aioli was again delicious here and was definitely the star. The potatoes kind of tasted like homefries. They were on the well done side, so for those of you that don't like almost-burnt food, stay away (I happen to love it). What I didn't love about this dish was the MASSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL that was in the plate. You literally saw the red oil seeping out of the potatoes as you speared them on a fork. You know there's too much oil when an \u00a0INDIAN person is dabbing the food in an extra towel. I like and don't like the fact that the food comes out at different times. I like it because then the tables around you don't judge you for how much food you get, and you can work on things slowly and savor your food. I don't like it because of how awkward it is when one person has food and another doesn't. You can't really have them wait otherwise the food will get cold (or you can do what I did and just eat half of your boyfriend's order). Also, not a fan of the price. For the amount of food we got, portions could have been altered a bit.

The paella was also flavorless, and the rice was crusty and dry. Also, at least two individuals in our group had eggs that were under cooked which was surprising given the number of egg based items are on the menu (you'd think they could get that right).

The other night a group of ten of us got together to celebrate successfully completing marathons; while OK eight of us completed marathons - one in the group had a good excuse (she was eight and three quarter months pregnant) and one not so good (I am too lazy to train for a marathon, so settled for a half). Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba features a vast array of tapas and breaks them into categories including pintxos (bite sized tapas, kind of like a Spanish amuse bouche but harder to pronounce), vegetarian/cheese, seafood, beef/lamb, and chicken/pork. There are also a few nice paellas to choose from and housemade breads with dips (there is also complimentary basic bread service with olive oil) and of course desserts (there are full sized desserts of dessert pintxos). Sangria is quite popular here (available by the pitcher, half pitcher or glass and in traditional or flavored - there is even a Cava based Sangria); for those not fans of Sangria there is a decent list of reasonably priced Spanish wines (running as low as $28 per bottle and many selections under $50) as well as beer (including some on tap) and cocktails. Adding value there are often freebies you can redeem if you check in via Foursquare or Yelp.As we are distance runners, we tend to have hearty appetites and this enabled us to order a huge variety of tapas (we must have consumed nearly half the menu)! Nearly everything we tried was good, but I would not say there was a single must have dish and the menu did not seem to have changed much since I was last here a couple of years ago. Since my fine dining kick I have been on for the past year and a half I am always nervous returning to venues I used to love before becoming spoiled by Chicago's top tier restaurants, but Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint. For $40 a person (including tax, tip and moderate alcohol) we were able to eat like kings. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is open nightly for dinner and also has Friday lunch and weekend brunch. They post special events on their website such as a Flamenco Dinner Show with music and dancing and Paella Cooking Demos. The atmosphere is lively and casual and the decor is made to transport you to Spain without being tacky or overdone. Service is reasonably attentive and adequate. \u00a0Ba-Ba-Reeba is a popular venue so it can be a bit noisy and reservations are recommended (they are on Open Table). There is a large bar where you can enjoy a glass of Sangria as you wait for your party to arrive, but I did appreciate that they sat us before our entire party arrived. The menu has a nice variety of food to choose from (even the vegetarians in our group found plenty to keep them happy) and while the food is certainly not outstanding, for the money it is a good choice if you are in the mood for Spanish tapas.", "Date": "2012-11-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Timothy L.", "ReviewID": "zUH0SuEeoF3yVikJ4JBi4Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Maybe I have a high standard, but I thought the dining experience was just \"ok.\" I took a generous sampling of the menu, including the platter on the top of the menu.

I also want to say that I am a big fan of Cafe Iberico (which I also gave 4 stars). Having been to both places now, my boyfriend and I said last night that the tapas at BaBa were better, but like the Paella and Sangria at Iberico more. However, I looked at the Iberico menu before writing this review and noticed they have many of the same items (which I haven't had yet) we ordered at BaBa last night. SO I will be going back to Iberico and ordering them so I can decide which place I like better. Now for my review:I have heard many good things about Cafe BaBaReeba, but just went for the first time last night. I was there for my friend's birthday with about 7 other people. We had a reservation, so were seated right away, It wasn't very busy (but I assume that's because it was a Monday evening). A few of the girls with us had been there many times before and already knew what to order, so the rest of us took a quick look at the menu and nothing else seemed to jump out at us so we just went with what ever they got. We started with two pitchers of the WHITE PEACH SANGRIA. It was okay, but I personally would have ordered the Black Raspberry. We started off with 2 SPICY POTATOES W/ TOMATO ALIOLI, 1 GOAT CHEESE BAKED IN TOMATO SAUCE, ENDIVE SALAD, and FRIED CALAMARI. The spicy potatoes were delicious! I had never had goat cheese before, (and it tasted a bit strange at first) but it was very good. I did not try the endive salad or calamari, however, a few people commented the calamari was a bit more chewy than usual and my boyfriend said the salad was good. My boyfriend and I also ordered the PAELLA VALENCIANA for 2 (since no one else wanted it). They split it into two plates for us...I think it could have served 4, but my boyfriend ate his entire portion...I did not. We also agreed that we liked the Paella at Cafe Iberico better.Next we ordered 2 BEEF TENDERLOIN & BLUE CHEESE, 2 BEEF SKEWER W/ HORSERADISH AND RED ONIONS, 2 BRAISED SHORT RIB W/ MASHED POTATOES, and OCTOPUS. The beef tenderloin was fantastic...very juicy and medium rare (just how I like my beef). I did not particularly care for the beef skewer, it tasted a bit charred and was not very juicy. The braised short rib was so tender and yummy...and the mashed potatoes weren't bad either. I didn't try the octopus (not a big seafood person).They brought my friend a serving of the chocolate cake (which was small, because it's a tapa!) for her birthday and we sang to her. We all had a bite and it was pretty good. We definitely had enough food for the 8 of us and I didn't feel too full. The bill ended up being only $30/person since we only split it 7 ways (not too shabby).I would recommend at least going one time and I would have no objections to going again.", "Date": "2011-10-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Helena P.", "ReviewID": "zNv8TebPAdvthYTM8Ar2BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been to this restaurant at least 15 times.

They included the \"special sauce\" on the side and a tray to serve them on. Allison made sure that I refrigerated the tapas, but explained that they are served room temperature.

Meaning just I've been before and not really cared for the establishment. There is just something about the service, decor, drinks and especially the food that rubs me the wrong way. But foolishly I came in thinking maybe this time will be different... flash forward... I had to take a day off from work due to severe stomach cramps among other happenings that I won't divulge. Some THING didn't agree with me to say the least. That thing was paella!! I generally eat pretty healthy so certain greasy foods just don't agree with me but it's never been this bad. So it could be one part me, two parts nasty paella. The night didn't start how it ends though. My date and I walked in to a smiling host who sat us right away. After meeting about 20 waiters (of course exaggerating but not by much) we were finally off ordering. To start we had stuffed mushrooms and the chicken empanadas which were both pleasant but nothing to tell mama about (Mama luuuuvess tapas). After a few drinks and some descent food, I was starting to think Caf\u00e9 Ba Ba Reeba and I were developing a nice relationship. Then I made the mistake of trying something new, but I thought it was safe I mean they are known for their paella, aren't they?!?! Hell, it's even in their logo \"Tapas and Paella\"! We ordered the \"special\" paella and what we received was \"special\" indeed... what was served was this greasy, soft rice, and what looked to be chicken (tasted like that \"chicken\" in frozen dinners other wise known as rib meat). It was a mess and both of us had the same feeling right away but being hungry still we decided to go with it. The portion size is for two but we could barely stomach it and decided to call it quits after eating only half of it (most of that half eaten by myself). Not feeling well right off the bat, we wanted quickly to call it a night but couldn't find our waiter, who hasn't shown up since stopping by when the paella came.

We had lots - the cheese sampler, garlic shrimp, octopus with potatoes, bacon dates, croquettes, chicken turnovers and the Spanish sausage platter - I say it all in English, because the tapas here are crazy Americanized and lacking strong Spanish flavors I've come to expect from tapas. Many of these items were individually priced less than at some of my favorite tapas spots, so that part was nice. Everything was okay, not bad, but only just fine. The croquettas though were really soggy for something that is usually fried crispy and I couldn't get anybody to eat them. \u00a0The octopus was not very well marinated and I'm a little afraid it's tentacles grabbed my innards a bit, because it took some effort to get that down. \u00a0I did like the presentation of the bacon dates on toothpicks. \u00a0I was disappointed with the white sangria, which didn't seem like sangria at all, but like a glass of slightly sweetened white wine with tiny diced pieces of fruit only on the top and the glass was almost completely filled with ice.The chicken tenders from the kids meal was one of the best things I had here - a whole chicken breast fried crunchy and super flavorful and then cut into strips served with mashed potatoes - I might get that myself if I come back here.

My gfs and I decided to leave the pleasant 70-80 degree weather of SoCal and visit an old college gf in Chicago this past weekend. On our last night there, we wanted to do a nice dinner before a night out in the town. Unfortunately we got our day started super late (3 pm!) but our gf heard a lot of great things about this place and the deciding factor to come here - they close at midnight! We made it to our 10:30 pm reservation, where the restaurant was fairly occupied, and were graciously received by our waiter. He was very attentive and made a lot of recommendations, so we took his word on it. What we got (in the order it was received):White Mango Sangria (Sangria special of the day/week/month?) - this was hands down the BEST sangria we've ever had! We loved it so much, we ordered two pitchers! Ahi Tuna Salad - very goodStuffed Mushrooms - LOVED IT!Chicken Empanada \u00a0- very goodBraised Short Ribs w/ mashed potatoes - LOVED IT! Skirt Steak w/ Scallions - very goodShrimp in Garlic, Olive Oil sauce - very goodSpicy Potatoes in Tomato Aioli Sauce - the aioli sauce was very good but we were disappointed with this dish, perhaps if we had received it as one of the first dishes rather than last we would have liked it more. It was decent but definitely not as WOW as the previous dishes. Meatballs in Sherry Tomato Sauce - this too was a disappointment, we ordered this one last minute after seeing someone else order it and just remembered we wanted to try it too. we probably should have ordered something else when our waiter said it was good but not one of the best, he was pretty eh about it. Butterscotch Custard Cream - our waiter was pretty adamant about this but it was WAY too sweet for our taste - and I really love my sweets too! Chocolate Tres Leches - LOVED IT!Cherry Bread Pudding a la mode - LOVED IT!Our waiter sensed our disappointment with our last few dishes, and being that it was our first time there, he comped the meatballs and all of our desserts! We definitely loved this place and will have to come back the next time we're in town! I just checked their website and they apparently have a location in Las Vegas too, so we're going to try that location as well (hopefully its on the same level as this one!)Some last minute observations: seems like a great place for groups, especially for the GIRLS!

The service was horrendous. Everyone got their food at different times - there was at least a 10 minute lapse between the first dish that was dropped off and the last. The servers continuously dropped food off at one end of the table and expected us to pass the plates around - they had no interest and giving the correct person their plate. They wouldn't even announce the dishes, so we had to try and figure out each dish. They seemed completely oblivious to the concept of good service. And the biggest annoyance was that the place was not extremely crowded. There were at least 15 open tables around us, so I'm not sure why service was bad when it wasn't busy .In terms of food - I don't think you can call something \"Bacon Mac & Cheese\" when it's just a plate of mac & cheese with a slice of bacon on top. Also, is the brick egg supposed to come with a raw egg? When my friend cut through the fried outer layer of his dish, the entire egg was runny, from the whites to the yolk. It was disgusting. And the waiter, while polite and gracious in getting my friend's replacement order, never apologized for an obviously undercooked dish - he seemed to brush it off as typical. My dish (chorizo, manchego, and vegetable omelet) was good enough though. The waffle-battered chicken stick was not impressive - it looked and tasted like a stunted corndog. I would save my $2 for another novelty.

I order two glasses of red sangria - $13. \u00a0Seems steep, but ok. \u00a0I give the guy $15. \u00a0We then are called to our table by hostess number three (more attitude), and shown to a table on the patio. \u00a0We sit down, open the menus, and look at the drink list - red sangria is $5.50 a glass. \u00a0I wasn't overly impressed. \u00a0Then, our server arrives. \u00a0She doesn't appear to be interested in letting us experience the leisurely pace of dining that one would normally associate with an evening eating tapas, for when we place an order for two tapas she asks \"Is that all?\". \u00a0 Our first tapas come, and we place an order for a spinach salad and paella. By now our sangria glasses are empty. \u00a0I certainly need another drink, but flagging her down proves to be a chore. \u00a0When we finally get her attention we order a half pitcher of red sangria. \u00a0Several minutes later (shortly before the salad tapas dish arrives) our \"half\" pitcher of sangria arrives. \u00a0When we finish the meal the bill tells the story - \u00a0she had brought a full pitcher. \u00a0Being overcharged for drinks isn't a big deal - we are only talking $8 total - but the constant attitude from the waitstaff and the complete indifference to our experience in the restaurant was really frustrating. \u00a0 \u00a0I am sure that we will go back to Ba-Ba-Reeba because we really do love the tapas and the sangria; hopefully the service will be back up to LEY 's high standards.", "Date": "2008-06-30", "Author_Location": "Davidson, NC"}, {"Author": "amish s.", "ReviewID": "e0exBWkwMbdxurcmOXu3_Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Every bodies given this place a varied review, but sorry, I didn't have that great a time here, went on Saturday, ordered x2 different tapas dishes, the \u00a0grilled squid in olive oil and garlic and the roast tomato filled with tuna.After getting my food and trying the tuna dish all I could do was laugh..the tuna, no lie or exaggeration tasted like it had come from the can into my plate, the tomato was good, but the tuna, seriously, from the can.

The service was prompt, but we had a different issue. I understand when the restaurant first opens there are not many tables to attend so the servers stand around, but we felt down-right uncomfortable eating because we were being watched by different servers who were not busy. It was hard to relax and enjoy the food when we could see them just standing there watching us. Quite uncomfortable. This is more a note to the business, just something to keep in mind. Other than those two issues, I love coming here.

This place was it - so awful that I have to share with others to hopefully save you a trip here. I eat out like it is my job and this was by far the worst tapas restaurant I \u00a0have ever been to. Came on a weeknight for a quick dinner. Had a 30 minute wait and when we were seated, the waiter took his time coming around to our table. We place our order and tapas start coming out but he managed to completely forget about my sister's sangria order. With the lack of service, she didn't receive it until we were eating our last order of tapas because it took that long for one of the numerous people we flagged down to actually go tell our server he forgot about the drink! His excuse, \"Oh sorry, I couldn't read my own handwriting!\" Wow, I mean wow. There are so many things I could say right now but its just too easy so I will pass. I am sure you just thought of a few things yourself. Anyway, on to the food! First the bacon-wrapped dates. Gross. Burnt and greasy. I've had much better at other tapas restaurants. This is a hard one to mess up but they managed. Second, chicken and ham croquettas. Meh. Tasted like nothing in particular and the dipping sauces didn't complement the dish. Third, the shortrib with mashed potatoes. The most decent dish of the night but the mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box. Last was the chicken and chorizo sausage skewers. Wow, undercooked chicken and the worst tasting chorizo sausage I have ever had the misfortune of putting in my mouth. I love chorizo sausage so that was the final straw for me. After bad service and poor quality food we left there smelling like the stench of grease that overpowers the entire restaurant. You are better off at any other tapas restaurant in the city.

I have been happy with almost every small plate I've had there, however, I do have some favorites. The spicy potatoes are a must and we usually order two. We love the short ribs with the mashed potatoes, the spicy shrimp is great (and the garlicky oil is great for dipping their delicious bread) and the goat cheese marinara is a great starter. Also, make sure you get the short rib stuffed piquillo pepper. It's a perfect bit. The paella is ALSO awesome. It's hard to save room for it (it takes awhile to prepare) when you've eaten all the delicious tapas, but you have to try. I like the seafood combo, but husband likes the chicken & pork.

It's unique only to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and they become more aggressive at night. That was our group's joke of the night.We went early on Saturday and got a table at the bar. This place is packed and it is so overwhelming. Another classy touch is the 'announcements' that come throughout the night. The loudspeaker will call out one of the many people waiting around for a table. It's like going to The Rainforest Cafe 'Tarantula, party of 4'. It is LOUD in there. Why are people waiting for this place for so long?!Our food was fine. Between the 3 of us, we ordered a lot of food and we ate it all: seafood, steaks, cheeses, etc. I will say that I didn't feel the dishes were very Spanish inspired, but I would say few plates on the menu met that criteria. The sangria was weak. Our waitress told us that the black raspberry sangria was the most popular. Ok, so I ordered one. All I could taste was the black raspberry liquor. I don't think there was alcohol in it. I did not order another drink. The drink menu in itself was pretty weak.The Plate Vultures circled all night. Essentially, if there was an empty plate on the table they would swoop in and pick it up. Which is fine if the plate is empty, but there were a few occasions where we had to stop them from taking food we were still eating away. Do these guys get paid by the plate?! It was annoying. Also, when we were paying the bill, I was holding it up and discussing how to split it with my friends. One of the Plate Vultures came by and tried to reach past me (I was sitting by the wall). I told him I wasn't done with the bill as he tried to reach he hand between my face and the bill.

Come to Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba for a few of the classic Spanish tapas: \u00a0sangria, wine, baked goat cheese and marinara (always a must) , great cheese selection, bacon-wrapped dates, olives, etc. \u00a0Unfortunately I find most other things fried, or saut\u00e9ed with an oppressive, heavy-hand of olive oil. \u00a0Example 1, octopus & potato a la plancha: potatoes were fried and the peppers and octopus were swimming in olive oil. \u00a0Octopus is such a delicate protein, all of the oil masked masked the fresh flavor I was seeking! \u00a0The only notable thing about it was that they actually cooked the octopus correctly--- too bad they ruined it with too much oil. Example 2, fried green peppers & coarse salt: \u00a0one of my favorite tapas to order wherever I go---- except once again, here they are swimming in oil. Put a paper towel under those things after your fry them or something! \u00a0It IS possible to fry things w/o excessive grease. \u00a0Example 3: prime sirloin, asparagus, shitakes & yukon potatoes. \u00a0Again, ENOUGH WITH THE OLIVE OIL POOLS AND PUDDLES OF BUTTER!!!!! The meat was ok but the veggies were doused in fat. So sad!With of of this said, I do come back quite often. I love coming with friends because laughing, with a glass of great red wine in hand, beside a table of cheese makes for a perfect night. \u00a0Hopefully the chefs in back take a hint and ease up on the EVO and punch up the spices instead. \u00a0Anyway, great place to hang with friends and nibble but I'm still on the lookout for a better casual tapas spot. \u00a0if you want tapas to write home about, make the trip to Mercat a la Planxa. \u00a0Def a more upscale vibe but it does not disappoint.", "Date": "2010-11-21", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Erin K.", "ReviewID": "lBVQ22uP1dKBrLLSI9vBsw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4.5 stars, only because I can't rate it quite as high as Cafe Iberico.I came here the other day with a friend for the first time, and I was surprised that we were seated immediately at 9 on a Saturday night. 10 points for Griffindor!

Saturday night my cousin and her fianc\u00e9 were in town from Grand Rapids, and while they had originally wanted to try Kuma's, they balked at the idea of a two-hour wait. He had been to Caf\u00e9 Ba-Ba-Reeba once before; Caf\u00e9 Ba-Ba-Reeba it would be. \u00a0 \u00a0 Oh, but speaking of two-hour waits, that's precisely what we were presented with upon arrival. I had called earlier in the evening to attempt to make a reservation, and after I was told that the only time slots available were 4:30 and 10:30, we agreed to take a chance in the 8 o'clock hour. Oof. \u00a0 \u00a0 I'll give Caf\u00e9 BBR this, though: Our name was called almost exactly two hours after we arrived. I'm talking to the minute. And the two hours didn't end up being so bad: We drank a pitcher of sangria in the bar while we were waiting for our table. \u00a0 \u00a0 We went about the ordering process in typical nerd fashion: We agreed that we would order eight dishes for the four of us, so everyone would write down their top two choices followed by a third \"kind of want\"-type choice. And, hurrah!, there was enough overlap so that everyone got all three items on his/her wish list. When going to a tapas restaurant, I highly recommend bringing a small notepad and pen. We were feeling so good about this that we threw in one more item, the meatballs, which, as it happened, would have been a regrettable omission. \u00a0 \u00a0 Pear sangria was also ordered. Upon first sip, my cousin remarked, \"Oh, that's going to be a problem.\" She meant this in a good way, in case that wasn't clear. Pear sangria=revelation. \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me make this easy. Here are the items we ordered: artisanal cheese, garlic potato salad, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (another cousin quote: \"Alioli makes everything better\"), goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, rioja-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes, handmade beef empanada, seared Spanish sausages, grilled salmon with herb almond pesto, and of course the aforementioned meatballs. At the meal's end, we all agreed that there wasn't a single item we would have omitted. The salmon was insanely flavorful, the empanada was overflowing with meat, and the short ribs fell away from each other in a manner that made me want to cry. Even the mashed potatoes were above average in a way that a dumb old potato is not supposed to be: cheesy, extra creamy, flavored with something else I couldn't identify, really good mashed potatoes for the love of Pete. \u00a0 \u00a0 I suppose you must take this review with a grain of salt, given that we were all starving and buzzed by the time the food arrived. \u00a0 \u00a0 Our waitress was somewhat short with us a couple times, but she likely was on the tail end of a very long day. I do like to give people the benefit of the doubt. However, when my cousin's fianc\u00e9 innocently asked which spices were in the blood sausage, she pulled the whole martyr routine by making clear that she would ask someone even though she was in no mood to ask someone. When she returned ten minutes later, she said something about her manager having to \"go to the basement\" to find the answer. Um, okay? Again, though--probably had been a long day. \u00a0 \u00a0 As it happened, the unidentifiable ingredient was cinnamon. My cousin's fianc\u00e9 was happy to know this. \u00a0 \u00a0 I will happily return to this place, and make sure I make a reservation sometime prior to the day of next time.", "Date": "2012-11-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Liliana S.", "ReviewID": "jOo2iiAn-WfIXRHee8f9Kw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As authentic as a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant cant get.

We sat outside on the patio and started off with a couple drinks. The passion fruit sangria was pretty good...though took a few glasses to get me tipsy. We ordered a variety of tapas (of which i would definitely say the meaty ones are worth ordering again!!). Overall, I would say the food is average.

I used to go to cafe ba ba reeba pretty often but somehow it had fallen off my radar. we went back tonight and I remembered why I like it so much. the evening started off a bit rocky. we made a resi for 6 ppl about 3 weeks ago. when we arrived right on time, we were told to please wait at the bar and they'll all us when our table is ready. so we did. and we waited. we finally got seated about 25 minutes past our reservation time and were all a little on edge. we tried to brush it off. also adding to our frustration, we got seated outside in the semi tented area. normally I'd be really happy about that....but it is fall now and it was 60 degrees! I don't think a restaurant should seat you outside unless they've asked if you're ok with it. especially when we had a reservation and it was clearly pretty darn cold. I swear I'm getting to the good stuff. after all this is a 4 star review. about 5 min after we sat, the manager came over. he must have been informed of our grumblings. he apologized greatly for the delay in our seating and for our less than ideal table. he offered to close the tent roof a bit and pump a little heat in. he was just so nice and genuine that we were all reset and started fresh. the closed tent and heat made a huge difference. also, when we got the bill, he had taken $20 off. really great handling of customers. they definitely redeemed themselves. all I ever want is for a restaurant to recognize the problems and handle them. the money off was just super nice icing on the cake. so the food....mmmmm good. this isn't a super duper authentic tapas place. so if you want that, go somewhere else. it is a great fun place with really yummy food. it's a little more chainy feeling than I generally like, but the food really makes up for it. some of my favs:curry chicken salad ( this is one of my fav things of all time. love it )goat cheese and tomato sauceany of the empanadas short ribs with mashed potatoesthey're all really solid dishes. I don't think you'll run home saying \"these are the best tapas I've ever had\", but I also don't think you'll be disappointed. side note - I am a little disappointed that they got rid of the egg salad with shrimp pintxo. it was soooo good. oh yeah, and the sangria is great. thanks ba ba reeba.", "Date": "2010-09-24", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sarah C.", "ReviewID": "lbToE-9ZG8Fao0WSlGkQ1w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BEST tapas place i've tried so far.

The waiter seemed lacking in confidence about the menu and what to recommend. But he poured way too much wine into the glass. Tsk tsk.... That's a no no especially with the type of glasses that were used. I had to tell him to stop at a certain point. Swirling is not for show aesthetics or being snobbish. It's to help identify the different aromas of the wine and also a way of aerating it to open it up. Anyways that's always a pet peeve of mine. More waiters must be educated on wine etiquette. The patatas bravas was ok. The patatas con alioli was a little under boiled for the potatoes... The hanging beef and chicken were way too overcooked... The chicken and chorizo paella was actually very good. Well flavored. The citrus seared salmon was very good. You can hardly go wrong with salmon though.. If you do you should really reconsider being in the restaurant business.. The simplest dish happened to be my favorite and that was the grilled chili pepper topped with Mediterranean sea salt. Yum!!

I think that this is a must-try for everyone, once in their life. Awesome ambience. The outdoor patio with sunroof is gorgeous! Great ambience. Perfect for taking a date, or group of 4. I really wouldn't recommend more, otherwise you'd need to double up on your dishes- everything's so delicious, one bite is not enough. Here's what we got.*Scallops- absolute, hands down, best dish we tried! bacon bits and some greens. Just perfectly delectable.*Beef skewer with red onions and horseradish cream. I like horseradish cream, my sister doesn't. Tastes amazing whether you add the cream or not. perfect heartiness.*bacon wrapped dates- Great combo of bite-sized sweet and savory.*Squid with arugula- I'd ABSOLUTELY recommend this over the calamari. Although I haven't tried the calamari, it's a great alternative to fried squid. Beautiful texture, delicately grilled. Not chewy at all, and just tasted great.*Stuffed mushrooms with manchego and spinach- great for vegetarians and non-veggies alike! Best stuffed mushrooms I've had, I think.*Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli- perfect for filling up for fullness. couldn't stop snacking up on these! i was like, '\"this would be great with fries!-- oh wait, I'm eating potatoes with em aren't I\"for drinks, my sister and I ordred a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria.

As a Lettuce restaurant you can rest assured that it's run like a well oiled, always bustling, machine. Typical of any Lettuce or LP restaurant, without (and sometimes even with) a reservation you will always have a wait, but they have a decent size bar area to try and squeeze into. The patio is great, covered and lit with hanging lights. The service is always reliable, nothing exceptional, but no complaints. I love the way the tapas menu is set up, you can pick and choose from different meats, seafoods, veg, etc. mixing and matching as you go. And since the food arrives pretty quickly, it's great to keep a menu on hand to not only remember what you order but always add more. Having been there many times, I've had many of the menu items, but the below are my standout favorites:- Sangria - any one of them are delicious. True, they may have a tad too much ice and could use a smidge more sangria, but then again I could always use a little more sangria- Bloody mary bar - sure, there are dozens of places with a build your own bloody mary bar, but theirs is fantastic. You pick your vodka and your given a glass to fill with all your favorite things. They have several different tomato juices to choose from, a wide range of hot sauces and a wide assortment of the proper accoutrements - all of which are critical to a perfect bloody mary- Grilled Squid with Olive Oil & Garlic - I honestly crave this quite often. The squid is perfectly grilled and seasoned with a nice balance of oil, acid and herbs.- Avocado Pintxo Toast - Just a small bite of toasty bread smeared with avocado, it's a nice, fresh, easy bite - Artisanal Cheese Plate - I imagine the cheeses change quite often, but it's a guaranteed good plate of bites and I've never been disappointedFour stars for good service, consistent food and a great standby.

Since my mom and I sometimes like people watching, we \u00a0didn't have a problem with Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba being a hot spot.On a Thursday night, the tables were filled and it was pretty loud. We could still have a conversation without yelling, and I thought the crowd kind of added to the atmosphere. The staff was attentive, and the tapas came out staggered so we were not bombarded at once with all of the plates. We ordered 1 cold and 3 hot plates, and 4 plates between 2 people was plenty. We also split the sampler dessert order and all 6 options were delish. If you don't mind a little noise, this is a fun place to check out in Lincoln Park. We may have especially enjoyed our visit due to splitting a pitcher of sangria :) The pitchers offer about 6-8 glasses.", "Date": "2010-04-09", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "B K.", "ReviewID": "DOIT52zhOnbGqJFKxqNUSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went there on a rainy and cold Sunday night with a fairly large group ... and if it weren't for our lively banter, we could've possibly heard a pin drop.

This was my first time to Ba Ba Reeba, and i was under the impression that it was small and intimate, but it is actually quite large. We had a reservation at 8.30pm and were promptly seated after we checked in.We decided to start off with some Sangria. We went with a white peach sangria. It was tasty. The prices for Sangria are around $7 a glass, $14 for a 1/2 pitcher (serves 3 glasses) and $20 for a pitcher (serves 6 glasses). We went with the 1/2 pitcher, which for the 2 of us was fine.IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP YOU GET A FREE PINTXOS PLATTER WORTH $8.50. Can't beat that. So I checked in on Yelp and got that. It was really good and gives you a good idea of all the different tapas. But the Pintxos is essentially 1 bite Tapas, so there were 6 bite size Tapas. We split each in half, but this would not be good for a group.Also if you join CBBR's text club, they will text you deals for free Tapas.We then ordered the following tapas1. Goat Cheese in Tomato Sauce. Highly Recommend that. 2. Beef Empanadas. Kind of tastes like a croissant with beef filing. I thought it would come with more than 1, but it only came with one. Still pretty good. 3. Braised lamb in Couscous. If was kind of like a lamb stew. If you are into lamb, then you would probably like this. if you don't like lamb, then probably not4. Bacon Wrapped Dates. Delicious. You have to get these.For Dessert, we got5. Caramelized Banana with ice cream. Delicious. Only thing is that the desserts are tapas style so they are really small. But maybe as Americans we are accustomed to large desserts.6. Chocolate Truffle. Delicious.Our total bill was $52 before tip, which is reasonable.Overall the food was good, just not sure if CBBR lived up to the hype.", "Date": "2011-04-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "A C.", "ReviewID": "CtNRm1Pi7O0Ylv2MdC6Csw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "food is delicious! however, very expensive!

Pass on the paella.Details I am very new to the Chicago area and tried this out Friday night with my SO. All in all, it's a decent little spot. Love the patio (where we sat) and the interior seemed nice as well. We had the pinxtos platter, which is six \" one bite\" tapas that are supposedly traditional in northern Spain. These were all very good and we were able to get two bites out of each :) We weren't terribly hungry when we decided to stop in, so we decided to split a small serving of seafood paella as our main. Small is right. We asked the waiter if it would be enough for two along with the pinxtos and he assured us it would be, and that the larger portion is a ton of food for two people. While at may be true, the small portion is not enough for two ( we hadn't mentioned to him that we weren't hungry). Now, that said, I am not one of these people who expect TGI Fridays size platters of food. Quite the opposite. But honestly, this would have been barely enough for one person if there'd hadn't been the tapas first and some bread on the table if the person was hungry for dinner. Portion \u00a0size aside, the paella was only ok. I'd say it was a bit greasy and definitely didn't have a lot of seafood in it. Also could be considered a bit bland, mostly a strong tomato flavor with garlic in the background, though it did come with some sort of basil aioli that I didn't care for and have never seen served with a paella; perhaps this helped the flavor? But again, added grease.Finally, the sangria. Not a bad price on the half and full pitchers if it was worth drinking. Which it is not. Perhaps I'm spoiled, but to me sangria should still taste like wine. Yes, you should have a bit of sweetness and be able to taste the fruit clearly, but it shouldn't taste like koop aid that someone dumped some red wine in to. I hear their margaritas and cocktails are much better.Conclusion: probably won't be going back of my own choosing, but wouldn't refuse to go if someone really wanted to eat there.", "Date": "2011-08-14", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Ryan M.", "ReviewID": "TIA0vAEH9md8iHWGFttGdw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My gf took me here for my birthday. \u00a0Everything we order was good but not great. \u00a0Probably ordered 10 plates and not one item stood out. \u00a0Kinda of surprised since the ratings were so good. \u00a0Probably would not come back.", "Date": "2011-09-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Stephen Z.", "ReviewID": "gMVXjr9B6CCd7lO6yM9Inw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was pretty good minus the wait at the bar before the bartender isn't that fast...

My girlfriend described it as the TGI Friday's of tapas restaurants, and I think that's a pretty apt summary. While I personally enjoy TGI's, I do NOT think that's what a tapas experience is supposed to be like. First of all, the portions were way too big (unusual complaint, I know). For me, one of the best things about a tapas restaurant is getting to try several different dishes without getting too full. Most tapas places will tell you to get three to four plates per person. \u00a0One or two at this place would be more than enough. And the food just wasn't good. Our scallops were so rubbery we couldn't eat them, the potatoes were under seasoned, and almost everything needed salt. And the drinks were WAY too expensive to be as unimpressive as they were. Everyone raves about the sangria, but I didn't think it was anything special and the mango version was watery and bland. The service was also lacking. We didn't get much attention and were seated in an awkward spot that was in the way of the waitstaff.

Once sat, everything went fairly well. The waiter was attentive and good about making recommendations with such a large menu. They were out of the salmon dish that we wanted, and he made a recommendation for the scallops, which we ordered. However, we were brought a completely different dish, and it seemed toward the end that something was lost in translation and the scallops were brought out long after everything else. We actually had to ask where they were in order to get them. The bacon-wrapped dates were fantastic, and the sangria was delicious. My friend got a mojito and said it was \"acceptable\".

My mom and I both sampled a pintxos. I had the goat cheese croqueta pintxo and she had the deviled egg, bacon and mustard. For tapas, I had the rioja-braised short ribs and mashed potatoes. It's a small plate, but very filling and delicious. The meat is very tender and the mashed potatoes have some kind of cheese on it. She had the endive, blue cheese, walnuts and membrillo. It was a salad- style tapa. It tasted some. It tasted so fresh. I didn't order any paella because they have to give you 2 servings at least and you have to pay for each, which is $11-13 and I'm saving for my birthday.I also had a black raspberry sangria in a glass. I didn't want to get a 1/2 pitcher or full pitcher because my mom doesn't drink and I don't want to have to drink that all by myself. I couldn't get drunk. I had other things to do.For dessert, I took home 6 pintxo Spanish brownies. They were delicious.

The entire experience was unconscionable and the sad thing is, this restaurant has so much potential because the food is not bad for what it is(I mean we are not talking about fine dining here) but service is service whether you are at L2O, Alinea, or \u00a0even dive restaurants--obviously CBBR isn't a dive, but I think I have had better service at Weiner Circle or Ed Debevics, if you get my drift.The reason this dinner was such a failure on so many levels is they had the potential to make more money by actually providing \"service\"--we wanted to order more food, drinks, and desserts, we just weren't given the opportunity--the owner is definitely getting a letter from me about this...in this economy, I think he/she can hire far superior employees who actually want to encourage repeat business. \u00a0 I usually tip 20% even when the service is bad, and I ALWAYS give extra gratuity when the party is larger then six... this has been the first time 18% was a sufficient tip.

From the prix fixe menu, you choose a pixto, 2 tapas, a paella and a dessert. I had the spanish cheese and quince for my pixto which was just two pieces of fruit and two chunks of cheese. This was my least favorite thing from the entire nite but, it didn't kill the evening. The tapas i had were DELICIOUS. I love lamb so it was a braised lamb dish with coucos, spinach and almonds. Everything in this dish were so perfect. I also had a grilled calamari tapas which was very good as well. I was super super excited about the paella, and i'm sorry to say it was not the star. In my paella was shrimp, tomato, greenbean and of course the rice. Everything in the paella was good except for the rice, it was kind of hard. This was my first time trying it so i wasn't sure if it was suppose to be like that or not. But still this was not a deal breaker. \u00a0Finally dessert, we were so stuffed we had our dessert packed to go, but when i got home...my oh my...the Caramel - Dulce de leche, Tres Leche Cake was SO GOOODDDDD!!!!!!

I don't think I was that impressed. Maybe it had to do with the fact that we visited Spain just last year. It was good, don't get me wrong. Just don't know if it's worth all this fuss on yelp. We walked in for a late lunch and still had to wait 20 minutes. Looking around the restaurant after we were seated, the place is really big and it looked like there were plenty of empty tables. Hopefully those were reserved because man, does it but me when we have to wait even though there's space for us. Anyways we tried their tapas - a brunch crepe with runny eggs, short rib, shrimp with garlic and olive oil, chicken and ham croquetas, citrus salad with goat cheese, potatoes bravas (spicy potatoes), and the beef empanada. \u00a0My favorite was the short rib and it came with mashed potatoes, although like 8-9 bucks for a tiny piece of melt in your mouth meat. The potatoes were just like how they make it in Spain but with a slightly less spicy sauce so I enjoyed it a bit more. I even got their passion fruit sangria - delicious but could've been stronger. We really wanted to try their paella but they didn't have it. And we came on a Sunday afternoon. If they don't have it on the weekends, when do they offer it - maybe only at dinner? And if you check in here on yelp, you get a free dessert. Even their desserts are taps-sized. Just a few bites.

Although the food was pretty greasy and the \"spicy potatoes with tomato alioli\" was just a fancy description for french fries.We had a reservation for 9 PM on a Friday night. It was crowded but clearly there is not going to be a wait for tables once we're done, so why rush us?Our waiter stopped by our table at least 15 times throughout our meal, probably every 5 minutes. I don't think that's good service, I think that's excessive and annoying. He would just stand there when we were in the middle of conversation until we had no choice but to acknowledge his presence. I understand that alot of restaurants in Chicago try to rush their customers on busy weekend nights, but it was already past 9 PM by the time we sat down. Even if we rushed through our meal in an hour, how many tables could you possibly need at 10 or 11? Plus, the whole point of eating out for me is to hang out with friends, not scarf down my food. And if the obnoxious waiter is one of our main topics of conversation, that is NOT a good thing. He kept refilling our sangria glasses from the pitcher, which again, some might think is good service, but after the 10th time, is just annoying because we want to control our own drinking and share equally. He was probably just trying to get us to drink more or finish and leave.I was also not impressed by the \"outdoor\" seating, which was an overly crowded extension to the restaurant surrounded by 3 walls and a ceiling. An obvious way to just seat as many people as possible.

My fiance and I went here this weekend because we had a giftcard - we would have been better off tossing the gift card and eating mac n' cheese at home on Saturday night. First off, their \"fantastic\" sangria was actually crap-tastic. It tasted like vinegar littered with massive chunks of fruit that a toddler in the back cut up with his play-doh knife. \u00a0Their tapas style menu was a de-glorified American version of it - portions are definitely not what you would consider \"classic\" Spanish tapas portions. Their patatas bravas which is your basic tapas dish was cut up like American french fries and I could barely taste the so-called \"spicy\" aioli sauce. Salmon was way overcooked as was our beef tenderloin smeared with an overpowering curdled blue cheese. Sick! The cheese plate was absolutely nothing to write home about. When you order a cheese platter, you're perhaps preparing yourself to be wow-ed by a new cheese that you've never had. They gave us some crappy goat's milk cheese with olives dancing about in it. They might as well have just given us a dish of olive tapenade to spoon into our mouths, because you couldn't taste any of the cheese. Now the waitstaff - the busboys seemed great and attentive to our ever-trashed pile of dishes. However, the queen that was serving us had a 'tude from the get-go and was not attentive at all - this was in fact, the only true-to-life portion of our experience (in Spain, they also will leave you at the table for an extended amount of time if you don't order something immediately). When we were served dishes with multiple items on it, we had to hunt our waiter down so that he could tell us what everything was (which he seemed annoyed about). Typically, in a restaurant, the waitstaff will outline what each item is (on a multi-platter) for you so that you know what you're eating. Dear Queen Waiter, Sorry for bothering you by asking you to do your job. We were actually going to order dessert, but because it literally took him 10 minutes (after we told him we were ready!), we decided we'd be better off without. Our meal was $80 not including tip which is absurd for the lack of service, amount of attitude, and the bountiful amount of crap food.
