Hands down Food - 5 stars- ordered a half dozen oysters in half shell. Super fresh and very tasty. Mix of large and small oysters. Oysters are not my thing and these oysters had me craving oysters the three days I was there. Also had fried soft shell crab with homemade cocktail sauce. \u00a0Perfectly fried and a very large crab. With the $16.99. Friend had the gumbo and couldn't stop saying how great it was. Value-5 stars- large portion sizes and fresh ingredients. All four of us left full. Service- 4 stars- place was packed and had to wait outside for maybe twenty mins. Hostess came out several times and was making jokes and helping the time pass. Waiter was friendly and helpful with menu and getting our food. Cons- can't split checks so bring cash or be ready to have/receive a IOU.

We ordered oysters, chargrilled oysters, craw puppies, etouffee, gumbo, and oyster shooters. I thought everything was tasty but those chargrilled oysters CHANGED MY LIFE. I love oysters to begin with but the way they made these were SO GOOD! The oysters are grilled with some kind of sauce which is so delicious and to make it even better they also provide bread for you to mop up all the sauce that oozed out. I seriously need to return to Nola just to eat this again or possibly learn how to make these myself. Service was friendly. Price was very reasonable.

We were hesitant on going the first couple times we passed by because the line scared us away but on our last day we decided to wait. Line wasn't that bad had to wait like 20-25 minutes. We had a group of three and had to share a large long table with another group of three which i didn't mind at all. We got two orders of boo fries. 1 dozen chargrilled Oysters and 1/2 dozen chargrilled Oysters, the \"10 napkin Roast Beef Po Boy\" and a marinated chicken Po Boy. These Boo Fries are a must if your going to Acme we could not get enough of these. The gravy is a perfect touch to these fries. Once we were done destroying the plate of fries they brought out the rest of our food. The \"10 Napkin Roast Beef Po Boy\" i got was really good, im not used to having Roast Beef in \" debris\" style but i enjoyed it, it was really filling too which i didnt get from other Po Boys in the area. I didn't try the marinated chicken po boy but i heard great things from my friend.  Im proud to say the first time i had ever had Oyster's was at Acme in New Orleans. I honestly thought that i wouldn't like Oysters since i'm not really a seafood guy. The only seafood i really eat is shrimp and even then im not the biggest fan. But this changed my mind about Oysters. Dont let the line scare you if you want to try Acme. Its worth it.

Finally, my po boy came in all its glory. Let me just say they are more than generous with the seafood. Lightly breaded oysters and shrimp perfectly fried, crisp lettuce, between a soft Italian bread bun. Mmmm.. it was heaven! Then the spicy Tabasco mayo gets in on the action and amps up the flavor of the whole sandwich. So good! \u00a0I couldn't eat it all but I stuffed those last 2 oysters in my belly.

If you have a party of 3+, prepare to wait a couple hours. There is a huge variety on the menu so even if you aren't all about seafood, there are still options available. The chargrilled oysters were... interesting. I'm glad I tried them, but they were too rich for my tastes. It's basically oysters baked in butter and parmesan cheese. On the other hand, the raw oysters are HUGE and juicy - definitely the best I've ever had. The jambalaya was also extremely flavorful... a little pricey for the portion price but definitely worth it. \"Boo fries\" (fries topped with gravy and cheese) were a good starter, but nothing to rave about - I wish the fries had been hotter and crispier but they were already cold when they got to our table. Drinks are strong and well-priced (though I am used to DC alcohol pricing). Highly recommend the Honey Do (like whiskey sour but with honey infused).

Exactly the sort of artery-clogging dish we wanted at the time. As for an entree, we wanted to try a little bit of everything, so our waitress suggested some sort of fried fish sampler platter. It had crawfish, white fish, and fried shrimp. I wasn't thrilled with this. I have had better. I just think it was a little too doughy...I can't even really put my finger on it. I just wasn't impressed and don't know that I would bother if I were to go back to NOLA. But for the chargrilled oysters and those Hurricanes, I might recommend it if there's no line. I will say the waitstaff was friendly, but it was hard to get her attention which is always a bummer, especially when your drink is empty...Meh.

I tried my parents' \u00e9touff\u00e9e and seafood gumbo and they were super salty too. The flavor of all three tasted almost the same. The saving grace was the fried crawfish tails we opted to order on the side. These were surprisingly perfectly salted. The one thing I did like about Acme was that they don't jip you on the oysters. If an oyster is super skinny, they'll throw in an extra one. I've never known any place back in NYC to do this. Pretty cool on their part. From my experience, I would say avoid Acme.

We had never been in New Orleans and \u00a0we drove up from Houston to the Lana del Rey concert the weekend of April 25th. Our first stop was to walk around downtown and grab something to eat. I had looked online to see what places were worth visiting and this restaurant was on the list. We were dying to have some New Orleans crawfish but reading online, we found out that the quarter is not so great for crawfish. Instead, we settled on eating a good appetizer before the night started. I saw online there was a lot of great reviews for Acme so we decided to try this place out. We parked and walked towards the restaurant. Right away, we noticed there was a line of about 10 people standing outside. I was a little impressed to see there was actually a line - it has to be good, right?! We stood in line and because it was only two of us, we were able to get seated pretty quickly - before the 10 people. Right away, we agreed to try the oysters. We LOVE oysters. Little did we know, we would literally fall in LOVE. We are from Houston, so we've had our fair share of oysters but these were absolutely delicious. They were a decent size, not stale/hard, smooth coming off the shell. They were so fresh. We ordered 3 dozen! We were that in love. We also shared \u00a0the New Orleans Medley which was incredibly delicious! This entire meal was outright perfect! I would eat the same exact meal if I could go back right now!The restaurant itself is a little small and crowded which may drive people away but it's really not too bad and the food makes up for it! We sat at the bar so we didn't realize the restaurant was actually bigger until we had to go to the restroom which is at the back of the bar. it was a little odd to pass through the waters area to get to the other side of the restaurant/bathrooms. \u00a0it's at a great location too!

Fried oysters and shrimp, some shredded lettucs, tomato, pickles, Tabasco mayo on French bread. Again, tasted primarily salty. I think it needed more mayo? I doused it in Tabasco and it was fine.

After only 15 minutes waiting in line on a Friday night, J and I were able to get a seat at the oyster bar - this was great because the guys who shuck the oysters like to have a grand ole time chatting up the out-of-owners. The restaurant was divey and dimly lit from the neon ACME sign out front painting the room a jazzy red. We ordered the below:Dozen raw oysters ($14) freshly shucked. These were great - they are juicy and plump. Not briney like some of LI oysters and not overly oceany like some of the west coast ones I've had. They were creamy but the didn't overpower your palette. Dozen grilled oysters ($20) - these were grilled with parmesean cheese and breadcrumbs. They were good but I liked Cochon's wood-fired ones better (possibly because too much Food Network has told me dairy and seafood don't mix?).Shrimp Etouffe ($9) - this was the first time I have had etouffe and maybe I am just not a fan of etouffe in general but the dish was very medicore. There were quite a few baby shrimp in the dish but the flavor just wasn't there and the roux was too thin.Soft-shell crab for 2 ($23) - thick battered giant soft shell crab - just how the south likes it. The soft shell grab was yummy but I am very picky about my fry batter and this was just a tad too thick and thought it could have been seasoned better. It had a good crunch though.We left full, and happy but the 4 beers and alcoholic smoothie from Bourbon could have been a factor.", "Date": "2014-05-29", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Cavan G.", "ReviewID": "DlIOUjEW9rnESiQC0_MiWQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For the amount of time spent in line, \u00a0the quality of food, the service and price there are much better places to go in NOLA.", "Date": "2014-06-02", "Author_Location": "Fox River Grove, IL"}, {"Author": "Stephen Y.", "ReviewID": "_zxR6nDpxZ4_cgZENMNfOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Be prepared to stand in line outside.

We were in NOLA for 5 days, eating out several times a day, and this was our ONLY poor experience. Horrible.We arrived around 1:30pm, figured we'd get in quickly... wrong. Line out the door, easily 8-10 people deep waiting OUTSIDE, and the street we were on smelled like trash water. They got through everyone fairly quickly, but when we got inside we realized how much of a chain (or at least it looked like a chain) this was. We were seated at the bar... not exactly ideal, but we were hungry, so whatever.The bartender was friendly enough and took our orders -- my sister-in-law got the seafood gumbo, I got the jambalaya and an order of hushpuppies. Our food came out in MAYBE 3 minutes... honestly not the best sign when we're looking for \"made to order\" food. My sister-in-law took two bites of her gumbo before declaring that it tasted like beef stew. My hushpuppies were barely warm, and my jambalaya was unevenly heated... HOT on one side, COLD in the middle, and warm-ish on the right. What the hell? Not only that, but both tasted like crap. Cheap, unimpressive, tasteless.It took us AT LEAST 5 solid minutes to get the bartender's attention. She had walked over RIGHT as our food was served and asked if we were okay, and we said yes. It seemed like she wasn't interested in chatting with us again for a while. She walked right by us several times as we sat with our hands folded and didn't even glance over. We finally did grab her (by yelling for her) and told her we were unsatisfied. She seemed confused and called over the manager (I didn't catch his name -- big guy, brown hair). We would have been open to giving Acme another chance if the manager hadn't been such a douchebag to us. The bartender wasn't so great either. The second he walked over she yelled out \"I asked them if they were okay and they said yes!\" and quickly clarified to us that she didn't want to be blamed. Well, no shit, who blames the server for the food quality?We told him that our food was cold and unappetizing, and he seemed to be in a state of disbelief. He asked us if we would like to order anything else off the menu (no mention of this being on the house), and we declined, saying we'd rather just leave. He then asked, in a rude tone, if we just wanted our food heated up. I'd had enough at this point and told him \"heating it up won't make it taste any better\".

I had added it to the \"to-eat\" list, but didn't expect it to be as good as it was.On our first visit it was fairly empty at 3 or 4 in the afternoon on a weekday. We sat at the bar and ordered a half dozen grilled oysters. I've never been a huge oyster fan (although I enjoy seafood generally), so I didn't think I would eat more than one or two. The bartender proceeded to warn us of their addictive quality and predicted our compulsive visits for the next week. He also introduced me to the awesome sauce that is Tabasco smoked chipotle. The oysters are worth any amount of walking, waiting, or standing in line that you have to do. I think we ended the week with 4 visits and 5 dozen total. That isn't to say the oysters are their only strength. The staff was friendly and attentive. We went on the afternoon of the bowl game and waited only 5 mins. If you have a party larger than 2, you may wait a bit longer. The other food was also very tasty. They serve the standard fried choices and a large list of po boys. On our first visit, we ordered the roast beef and fried shrimp po boys. The roast beef was extremely tender, soaked in a ton of gravy. The bread somehow held up, and the sandwich lived up to the \"10 napkin\" claim. The shrimp was lightly battered and tasted very fresh. I look forward to visiting again next time I am in New Orleans.

Obviously being called an Oyster House, you have to order the oysters!The boyfriend and I split an order of a half-dozen raw oysters, a half-dozen chargrilled oysters, and the fried seafood platter (oyster, shrimp, and fish). The raw oysters were nice and fresh, although expect an inconsistency of size. Some were big and others medium. As for the chargrilled, these oysters might have been small due to the cooking process but they came out bubbling in seasoned butter and cheese that was just oh so tasty! I was literally sticking the bread in all the leftover butter I could get! Hell, I probably would have drank the seasoned butter right from the oyster shell if it wasn't super hot! Definitely a must when you come here!As for the fried seafood platter, these was a delicious dish as well. The fried fish was nice and tender. The fried oysters were nice and big with a good oyster taste, unlike some places that give you the dinky small oysters that's mostly batter (YES! I'm talking about you Pappadeux!). The fried shrimp was cooked perfectly that I definitely cried when one fell of the plate on to the floor. Yes, I'll admit, I contemplated about the 5 second rule, but with the streets of New Orleans being as dirty as they were, I decided it was better left there then in my stomach.As for why 4 stars?

Cheap at $1, but not worth the conflict of taste with vodka, hot sauce and salty oyster.Second - The po'boys - big and overloaded. hard to fold up and eat unless you take half the stuffing out first (crawfish in this case)Lastly - the oysters - after all, that is what we CAME for!Chargrilled - Wow. to perfection.

He said they are all fresh but the oysters in Acme are so fresh you feel like they grew up in a loving family that's filled with laughter and kindness, whereas the oysters from other placed tasted like they had a conservative, middle-class upbringing. Go figure whatever that means. However, these oysters are tiny, like oyster-fetus kinda tiny. The oysters we got at Desire is about twice or three times the size of the ones served in Acme. 2. \u00a01/2 dozen chargrilled oysters ($12) - best chargrilled oysters, definitely get it when you're here. The last time I had an oyster was before I could talk and I've lived on a seafood-extinction diet for as long as I can remember, but the chargrilled oysters here is so tempting I ended up trying one before my conscious stopped me, and boy, was it delicious!

The butter herbed sauce, melted Parmesan cooked over an open fire. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. There was extra butter sauce on the plate after we scarfed down the oysters and 2 pcs of bread that come with the platter, so we asked for another loaf and drenched up the rest of the buttery goodness.Craw puppies - \u00a0not sure what this really was, but it was fried bread thing dipped in some white sauce.Crab cakes - Real chunks of crab and yummy sauce to dip it in. Not sure if the crab was fresh, but did I say Big Chunks?Po Boy - half with catfish, half with oysters. I am not a fan of fried food, but I had one bite of the hunnie's sandwich. While it didn't seem too heavy because of the lettuce balancing it out, it just wasn't up my alley. The hubs enjoyed it though.Shrimp Etoufee - It was kind of odd, everywhere we went in Nola, they could not make my food spicier for me., this Shrimp Etoufee included. Wet shrimpy saucy gravy over rice. I've never had this before, so I don't know what to compare it to, but it would have been bland had I not doused it in Tabasco Chipotle. Rice, gravy easy to eat with a spoon, I was satisfied with this dish. Luckily I ordered the Large size.Gumbo - The folks said this tasted about average. Looks like this is right on point compared to the other yelper's experiences hereJambalaya - The folks said this was about average too.Note- Try to show up with the entire party before hopping into line. It was kind of interesting , ok fine, it was annoying when the hostess asks you if your party of 4 is here and you have a few people wandering off(the curious boyfriend), and first she groups your with someones elderly grandmother, and then another group of people behind you, who are looking at you like you have lost your mind (There are no asians in NOLA) even after you point out your boyfriend is right over there 5 feet away several times as soon as the hostess/host team approach you.

They weren't as sweet as some oysters I've had but they were fresh. I had the soft shell crab po'boy with a side of fries. The crab was a little fishy but, overall, it was a tasty sandwich. It had a great crunch, not soggy at all. My favorite was the seafood gumbo. It was really good...I am still craving for it.

The front desk staff at our hotel also recommended Acme, but encouraged us to head over before the dinner rush. We were welcomed and seated quickly, in the front room, and ordered some local brews without a problem. But, when they were brought to us, they were just small plastic cups, not pint glasses (although they were pint-priced), and the waitress didn't seem to notice \u00a0or care that she spilled some of mine.Now, coming from CA, $13.50 for a dozen oysters is an excellent price, so I of course ordered a dozen. It was kind of strange that they weren't served on ice, but they were huge and crazy delicious! I'm assuming this is the reason Acme gets so packed, because everything else was overpriced and disappointing. The \"seafood\" ettoufee with crawfish was really a small plate of shrimp ettouffee with fried crawfish in a cup on the side (and it was more breading that crawfish). My boyfriend's \"10-napkin\" sandwich was also small, and disappeared quickly.Despite the fact that we were in the front room and in the path of all the wait staff, we were largely ignored by our waitress. When my boyfriend wanted to order dessert, she seemed annoyed by his questions, and the ice cream he ordered was TERRIBLE: it had almost no flavor and was waxy in texture.

Having just discovered a few months ago that I actually love raw oysters, I was really excited to go to New Orleans and see what they had to offer. If you're on/around Bourbon St, Acme and Felix's are the two best-reviewed oyster houses and, having tried both, I have to give Acme a close second. The line at Acme was always longer than the line directly across the street for Felix's, so you're likely to wait between 45 mins and 2 hrs if you come with a party of four or more during dinner hours. That said, they let you take pitchers of beer outside, so it's not as bad as it sounds if you're committed to having good seafood. \u00a0I'll base my ranking of Acme as the second-best oyster house on Iberville based on two dishes: chargrilled and raw oysters. The chargrilleds were a little overpowered by the parmesan cheese and the raw were too big for my taste (perhaps sacrilege to some, but although I love the flavor, I am a beginner). \u00a0One thing Acme did do much better than Felix's was beer--the draft selection was much larger and the Abita SOS is a great pilsner for washing down seafood. I also ate a pretty good (if standard) shrimp poboy, which had great fried shrimp and was made even better by the application of hot sauce (although I wish they offered something aside from Tobasco).

And I may be a little more critical of the food since we've heavily adopted Louisiana cuisine and we make it at home regularly. \u00a0We have been on the quest for perfect gumbo for three decades and to date, the best bowl of gumbo was made by a little old black lady out of a small shack in the Audubon Zoo. This lady seemed to always serve up a consistently perfect finger-licking bowl of seafood gumbo through the 80s and 90s and it may have very well been the best kept secret the the time predating Yelp.So, when we choose a place to grab a good bowl of seafood gumbo my family and I have the highest of expectations, without losing sight of the fact the French Quarter is first and foremost a touristy place that most likely won't deliver a comparable bowl of gumbo to what we make at home or to what we have had in the past. Having said this, what really pissed us off about Acme was the number of times we asked several different people if the Seafood Gumbo had any pork or sausage, to the point of pestering the staff. \u00a0We were repeatedly and sometimes half-indignantly told the Seafood Gumbo did not contain any pig. \u00a0So, you can only imagine my mom and dad's displeasure when they saw chunks of Andouille sausage floating in their gumbo. \u00a0The manager was very cordial and apologized but it was so loud I couldn't tell if he was explaining that someone in the kitchen had combined the Seafood Gumbo with the Chicken/Andouille Gumbo or if they had mistakenly served us the Chicken/Andouille Gumbo. I'm leaning towards the first option because the gumbo my parents got had both shrimp and Andouille, but no chicken. He immediately picked both bowls up and assured us they would bring out the seafood gumbo and comp them from the ticket. Forget about the refund, that alone is a HUGE red flag! Who mixes two different dishes in a diet-conscience time when people can be sue-happy over allergic reactions to foods and strict religious dietary restrictions? \u00a0My mom and dad were not happy for a good portion of the meal, so when the server brought out the seafood gumbo, my dad barely touched it. \u00a0It wasn't until we got the Seafood Etouffees that we somewhat regained our composure. And the Seafood Etouffee was good for a touristy area, but not as special as the long queue of people waiting to get in would suggest. \u00a0The shrimp in the Etouffee and Gumbo was so tiny, I wouldn't even bother using it as bait if I was fishing. And I'm almost certain it's frozen shrimp. You know, the kind you buy in a big bag from the frozen section of your grocery store of choice. The Fried Stuffed Crab Platter was tasteless, the crabs tasted like they were stuffed with 90% breading and 10% crab, and the fries tasted like they were frozen, so no, I wouldn't order this again. The hush puppies were decent.I'd most likely come back here for the ONLY item I enjoyed off the menu: the Raw Oysters. But you are in Louisiana. If anyone here messes these up, I think they chase them out of the state or throw them into the Mississippi. I'd also try the following menu items: Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy, Acme \"10 Napkin Roast Beef\" and the Boo Fries based on curiosity and the rave reviews by other Yelpers, but to be honest, I'd come back reluctantly based on the first experience with The Great Gumbo Gaffe.If you are looking for good Gumbo in the French Quarters, skip this place and head on over to Johnnys Poboys!", "Date": "2013-09-29", "Author_Location": "Austin, TX"}, {"Author": "Jessica M.", "ReviewID": "WsBuyHWoT4imQUG60YeIIw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In search of the best charbroiled oysters in the french quarter.

But I'll explain later...So, while in town, I text Gretchen P in Houston (a NOLA native) on dining recommendations. Yes, I browsed Yelp, but there is just too much to choose from in this fair city! She suggested Acme Oyster House. Just two blocks from my hotel, it was a definite go.Aw hell. Hold up, y'all. There was a 10-plus person line out the door! Much to my surprise, that excited me. \"It must be that good,\" I thought, because right down yonder was another oyster eatery with no wait. Date wasn't too thrilled, but as the hostess walked down the line, I asked how long the wait was: 15-20 minutes ... \"Unless you two want to sit at the bar?\" Hell yes. Straight inside and to the bar we went ... waving goodbye and blowing kisses to the poor saps in line (no, I really didn't do that. But I could have).And let me tell ya, the bar is the best place to sit. Plenty of elbow room, lots of TVs showing NO college football classics, hooks under the bar to hang your purse and the two friendliest bartenders/servers you could ask for. Tracy and Amanda (I think those were their names; homeboy with long braids and killer green eyes and a sweet gal who lived in Houston after Katrina and told stories about getting lost on the Beltway. \"Houston is too big!\" she said.)We ordered a half-dozen of the chargrilled oysters. \"You're gonna want the other half,\" Amanda said. I could tell she wasn't trying to upsell us, just being honest. Oh mah gah. She was right! These oysters come out bubbling with seasoned butter and topped with grated Romano cheese and with slices of French bread to sop up all that juice. I could've easily eaten another dozen of these--including the oyster shell. The fire and herby aroma was burned into those shells... I could have if *someone* didn't stop me. Ya hear? Chargrilled oysters at Acme Oyster House are a must. Being so popular and with the name \"Oyster House,\" I wanted more oyster flavors and varieties to choose from. Like, broiled oysters with spinach, deep fried oysters with buffalo wing sauce, bacon-wrapped fried oysters with jalapeno ranch. But the only thing they had were fresh, fried, shooters or the chargrilled (once again, amazing). That's the only reason why I deducted one star. Other than that, this place--environment, service and food prep deserved five stars.Other dishes I recommend are the gumbo (skip the cup and go for the bowl), fried stuffed crab platter ($13.99) which comes with fries, a slice of French bread and your choice of potato salad, slaw or hush puppies. The potato salad certain tasted homemade, with olives, chunks of boiled egg and red potato skins. \u00a0 I'll be back to try their crawpuppies and get some more of those chargrilled oysters. And once again. Don't complain about the line.

The drinks are poured ready to go.Our bartender/waitress was overbearingly nice and a tad bit funny to boot. She was probably the nicest waitstaff we had on the trip (sans the super service at NOLA; coming soon), so kudos to her for that.As for the food, the crawfish was just decent, and pricey at $9.99 per pound. Not faulting them there, it is what it is. I went with neither the oysters nor the crawfish, instead opting for the etouffee. S-M-R-T, huh?

You always go for the oysters, even if you don't like them, you eat them, because it's Acme and that's just what you do.Food:Oysters!!! I love them, and how can you not? These big ol' things are plucked outta the water and shucked in what I can only guess to be moments before they're slapped on a tray and served for you. Fresh seafood's always the best and you can't beat this freshness when you're so close to the bayou.To eat oysters: Add lemon, add sauce, slurp, repeat. Drink Abita and order more when you're done, of both.We also got the combo platter of gumbo, jambalaya and red beans and rice. The jambalaya was goooooood, not quite spicy enough but delicious none the less. The gumbo was eh, not so much, and the rice was under cooked while the beans were overdone. I love the oysters, but let's face it, this isn't 5 star dining. Even with the Bourbon St atmosphere (read: borderline drunk and disorderly) institutions should still be given their rightful stars. 3 for you, Acme, you're food rocks, and you'll live long and prosper, but you're still as touristy as they come.Venue:True to form, after drinking at HoB we lined up outside Acme and only had to wait for about 5 minutes before we were called in off the line. Don't let the line wrapping around the block intimidate you, you're going to get in quicker than you think.There's seating for well over 100 here easy, but the goal is to have each table turned over in under 30 minutes, so no dallying. The tables are red and white checkerclothed and the plates are a step above paper, but it's what you came in for, so don't scoff. If you're looking for upscale oysters with little forks and caviar, then go next door to the big gold and leather, white table cloth establishment known as the Bourbon House and get price gouged.

So fresh you could still taste the ocean water. I personally am not an oyster fan, but even I fell in love with their famous chargrilled oysters, which consists of butter, garlic and parmessan goodness. Their crawfish etouffee also delish. Their poor boy sandwich though does not compare to Johnny's. Like I said, my husband still talks about this place. I have truly never seen him eat this much.

I'd tried Desire (another fun oyster place) on a previous, and thought it was decent-good, so I thought we would visit it. Desire was closed, so I suggested we try the nearby Acme Oyster House. I hadn't been there in at least five years, and I thought we'd give it a go. Normally it has terrible lines, but it was bare on Tuesday for lunch, so it seemed to be an opportune moment to check it out.I feel really bad for anybody coming to New Orleans who comes here for a raw oyster and shows up here to find out what all the fuss is about. The oysters I was served at Acme were some of the blandest and least flavorful oysters I've had in recent memory. They came perfectly plated (perhaps *too* perfectly plated?), and seem to have been stored and chilled somewhere in bulk. I looked and looked for any sort of flavor, and the only time these oysters stopped being dull was when one of my girlfriend's ended up tasting like mud, silt, and something that comes out of a body part best left unmentioned on a family review site. It's like this: a good gulf oyster ought to have some sort of taste. Some salt, a little tang, *something*. These were just lumps of flavorless flesh, suitable only for tasting the cocktail sauce they were served with. They were so bland, my girlfriend and I agreed we should go next door to the Bourbon House, and try for a do-over when it came to looking for an oyster.FWIW, here's what I liked about the place:- Expected local beers (Abita variants, etc.) all on tap- Staff seemed nice and friendly- We didn't get sick from the oysters?If you want to understand why I gave this place one star, read the above review, and then realize this place normally has people *standing in a line outside the door* to get in.

Yet somehow when three friends and I showed up at the restaurant purgatory time of 530pm for a quick bite, Acme lived up to the hype.

You really do feel a sense of tradition at Acme--it's divey, wooden, but comfortable, and the focus is still on the food. Since we had dinner reservations in a couple hours, our waiter gave us a confused look after we ordered only a dozen chargrilled oysters and a peacemaker po'boy...we tried to explain our situation but i don't think he understood how the four of us could eat so little. Regardless, our waiter still gave us the time of day and made us feel a little less guilty. But wow, the food made me feel like I was now in New Orleans. The oysters came out on a huge tray, right off the grill, and were piping. The butter and grated romano cheese on top of the oysters created a bubbling, gooey crust that was ridiculously good. While a little gritty, the cheesy oyster paired with some french bread made us grown guys giggle...yes, giggle. Meanwhile, the fried peacemaker po'boy (fried oysters and shrimp in a po'boy) was already cut into 4, and the sandwich was fantastic. The simple combo of fried seafood, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and mayo within the po'boy bread made me wonder why this sandwich couldn't somehow be replicated in New York.

Granted, the first time I came here during my 28 hour trip was for jambalaya. My friend wanted jambalaya and we got that along with some gumbo and oyster shooters. The jambalaya and gumbo were good but not out of the world amazing. A tad bit too salty for me. The oyster shooters were strong (maybe we should've mixed them better). After we ate here I met up with Angela C and read her review for the Metairie location... I will jump on her bandwagon and STRONGLY recommend the chargrilled oysters. When my friend and I were perusing the menu, I said \"Ew, I don't want to eat cooked oysters\" when I saw the chargrilled item. I bite my tongue. As Angela later described to me in person, as I was salivating, the oysters are shucked and placed on the grill in its half shell and then some delicious things are placed on top of the hot oyster, French escargot style (which I also LOVE). The chargrilled comes in 1/2 dozen or a dozen. The 1/2 dozen was more than enough for me...But, that did not stop me from ordering the 'peace maker' fried shrimp and oyster po boy. This was my last stop before the airport and I needed to maximize my NOLA food intake. The peacemaker is huge. Angela and I shared one. Its hefty height makes eating messy. I like the tabasco-infused mayo and the oysters here are so fat and juicy! Also recommend. Don't come here if you're looking for something healthy.

Got into NOLA from Milwaukee with my brother, hopped on a cab. checked in at the ritz. and we were in the line at ACME within 1 hour.Was surprised to see a line at 3.30pm but thought, oh well, screw it, i need my oyster fix bad! Waited in the line for not more than 10 minutes and a hostess came by asking the usual \"how many, and asked bar or table\" we were there just for oysters, so we said BAR! and got to skip past the erhh 10-15 people ahead of us and went straight in. Sat at the end and started talking to deborah (the bar manager) and Gab (our oyster shucker) and started the oyster marathon. Oysters: Great cold and fresh albeit a lil dirty ( i like slurping them from the shell, but in this instance i had to use the fork) They go through so many oysters a day that i understand if they can thoroughly wash the shells. But anyways those were great.(went later on the same night to felix's across the street and a dozen oysters are 10 bucks compared to 13 at ACME, i would say quality is the same and ACME is charging a premium because of how well known they are, I don't feel ripped off though, because it's still less than 1/2 of what i pay in the midwest for oysters)Chargrilled oysters: Awesome too. I asked Gab if they were good, his response was, \"Are ya kidding me?! that's like the best thing on the menu!\"(i later on find out that he doesn't eat oysters raw despite shucking a shitload(~2000) a day) The grilled oysters are coated with cheese and im guessing a light brush of butter. dip the french bread given with the juices and just slurp those up. Oh yeah, awesomeness, but at almost 20 bucks a dozen...erhhh i rather stick to eating my oysters raw. Just personally speaking, its great, but my goal is to get more oysters bang for my buck, so i would go the halfshell route, try the chargrilled ones, but just don't get too overfixated on it. Fried Crab Claws: Ordered this because we were still hungry after 4 dozen oysters. tasted great and i wish they had this in the midwest but dang it. We ARE LAND LOCKED!!(Lakes don't count in my books)All in all, great experience, We got a new foster mum (Deborah) in New Orleans who's gonna be checking on us to make sure we don't \"get up to no good or drink too much\" and we got recommendations to places around the area to check out from Deb and Gab so, go check them out.

We stumbled onto this place after one of my friends from CA read the reviews. She is a seafood person and really loves oysters and crawfish. While waiting outside, the waiters would come out and ask if anyone wants to sit at the bar. Seeing how it's all the same, and you get the same services, if not more attention, we decided to skip the line and head to the bar. Upon sitting down, we looked at the menu's and noticed the prices of the oysters. Just to be clear, I do not eat oysters, so I would know nothing about them. My friend on the other hand, she's an oyster maniac. She gushed about the prices of the oysters and how affordable (and reasonably cheap compared to CA). We ordered a dozen Fresh, Ice Cold oysters and half a dozen Chargrilled Oysters. We also ordered the New Orleans Medley and the Acme \"10 Napkin Roast Beef\" po-boy sandwich. Once again, to emphasize, I do not eat oysters. When the dozen raw cold, gray, weird looking, yet fresh (described by my friend) came out, I did not want to touch it. Therefore I can not comment on that. But in the words of my friend, \"They were DELICIOUS!\" She said she would recommend them for all the oysters eaters out there. The Chargrilled Oysters on the other hand, that I could eat. I tried one of them, and they were DELICIOUS as well. This coming from one who does not eat oysters. They were flavored with seasonings and had some cheese melted onto the shells. This I would recommend, probably the dozen or so. But I believe that oysters are better eaten raw. The New Orleans Medley was what you expect in New Orleans. It had the gumbo and jambalaya, as well as beans and a sausage. All 3 of us sampled into each portion. The seafood gumbo was decent. Really watery, which I was told that is not how real gumbo should be (someone please clarify for me). The jambalaya was really good. It was well prepared and is what you would expect as jambalaya. The Acme \"10 Napkin Roast Beef\" po-boy sandwich is fairly large, so be careful. We all divvied it up and their responses were \"This is really good\" and \"Soft and tender\". I would have to agree with them. This was my main course, as I do not eat raw oysters, so a portion of that was allocated to the remaining two. Overall, I would recommend this place. One would have to either get here during off hours to miss the line, or just request for the bar seats.

The starters got me nothing but hungrier so when it came time for my seafood platter 1/2 catfish, 1/2 shrimp I was ready. Even after I got a cup of gumbo to go with it. Yeah! gumbo! one of the best I had. I've had 4 different kinds and it's definitely in the one or two spot. The hush puppies were good, number 2 besides Mike Anderson's. The platter was definitely great, the tartar sauce was excellent and went right with the catfish. I always loved fried shrimp and this place didn't disappoint.

During that short time, we discovered a historic city with long traditions of great music, outstanding food & continuing perseverance.Before I actually get into this review, I have a confession to make (which I have mentioned in a few of my other reviews): I'm not a huge fan of oysters. The girlfriend, on the other hand, loves oysters nearly to the point of obsession. Regardless of our relative level of oyster infatuation, we had both heard so much praise for Acme Oyster House that we had to go. Just like so many other popular places in New Orleans, the 1st couple times we walked by to check it out, we observed a long line to get in. So, we devised a strategy to show up shortly before opening time.It worked, mostly. Arriving early, there was only a short line. We actually ended up getting in & getting a table ahead of the line because we were party of 2 & the line was larger groups. Acme Oyster House has a very fun & lively vibe. The staff are a smiling & jovial bunch. The girlfriend & I started with a round of Bloody Marys. The girlfriend ordered a Fried Oyster Po-Boy & the soup of the day, Crab & Corn Chowder. I ordered a Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy & Red Beans & Rice. We also added an order of 1 dozen Chargrilled Oysters because we had numerous recommendations for the Chargrilled Oysters at Acme Oyster House.Expectations based on recommendations can be dicey. The girlfriend & I had already been to a couple spots in town that had fallen short of expectations built up from recommendations. This was definitely not the case at Acme Oyster House. \"Meets or exceeds\" is my evaluation of our experience vs. expectation here. My Fried Peace Maker Po-Boy lived up to its name & was easily delicious enough to persuade forgiveness from even the most enraged heart. My Red Beans & Rice were excellent. I tried a couple spoonfuls of the girlfriend's Crab & Corn Chowder & that was really good too. Ah, but the Chargrilled Oysters. I'm not someone who would go out of his way for oysters but I would absolutely go as far out my way as necessary for the Chargrilled Oysters at Acme Oyster House.

Well, it is,because that's what the staff told me. The food is kinda expensive, but I do appreciate that they offer a new Orleans sampler, with rice and beans, sausage, your choice of chicken and sausage or seafood gumbo (the chicken and sausage is more flavorful) and jambalaya. The gumbo was served with a bit of rice in the inside and boy was it a flavor bomb. It is absolutely filled with sausage and chicken in every bite, the broth is salty and salty and spicy,almost like a beef stew on steroids. \u00a0It's hard for me to judge because new orleans cuisine is definitely one I am not familiar with. I can say that it is delicious though,and that I'm happy that they offered a sampler platter. The chicken was tender, and not overcooked like it often is in chicken soup, and the sausage was full of meety flavor, adding its distinct saltiness to the jumbo. Whoa, the Jambaya is salty. Like super salty. It has chopped chicken (which had toughened up into something resembling chunks of pork) and sausage (chopped into small pieces) \u00a0in it. And both are flavored strongly enough to stand out from the rice of the jumbo (which is what is super salty).The beans and rice \u00a0are pretty good. Not the best baked beans Ive ever had. Theyre almost like slow cooked red beans in Mexican cooking. Except these are a bit softer, and are simmer with chopped up pork. A nice diversion from the salt heavy dishes. The sausage is actually my favorite. Its not super salty, sliced long side and grilled, giving it a nice char. It was meaty, not super salty, almost peppery. Definitely different from any sausage I've had before. Drier, but made up for it with the char, which I liked. The chargrilled oysters smelled delicious, but for $11.50 for half a dozen, Im going to go and see if I can find a place cheaper before I come back and splurge. Also, the only ingredients on the chargrilled oysters are according to the man at the bar: garlic butter and romano cheeseThis is how you shuck an oyster. Stuck the knife into the hole where the tendon holding the shell is. Pressure that hole until it pops, then cut both the muscles (one on each side) holding the oyster in place.

So tonight I wanted a po'boy and a beer. I wanted to make a mess and sit at a bar.Thanks to Yelp, I found a place to eat a po'boy within walking distance of my hotel. The reviews were right about the line of people and they were also right about it moving quickly.I was seated at the bar after about 2 minutes of waiting in line. Another guy sat next to me at the same time and he seemed confused. He should have read Yelp! I quickly ordered a half shrimp po'boy with a side of cole slaw. And an Abita- DUH. Then I saw the oyster shooter for $1.49. Cool. I didn't need a plate of raw oysters, just one would be enough- at least so I could try it. I mean, I AM at an oyster bar.The food came out quick, before my confused neighbor had even decided what to order. It looked perfect. The girl asked if I wanted tartar sauce or cocktail sauce, I said \"Sure, both.\" She was like, \"Really?\" I said, \"Sure!\" I had no idea what the po'boy would need. I mean, come on.I ended up adding both, but in hindsight could have done away with the tartar. The cocktail sauce was just like I like it: 80% horseradish. Horseradish is my favorite kind of spicy. I want to not hear what you're saying for a second because I had too much horseradish.Y'all can all keep your jalape\u00f1os and habaneros and fire-breathing dishes. I'll take an exploding head ANY DAY over having to keep my toilet paper in the freezer.So the food was great, but not mindblowing. The bread was just right, the cole slaw was decent cole slaw. I'm taking away a star because the fried shrimp- while delicious- were small, like salad shrimp. My neighbor ended up ordering a fried platter and his shrimp would have been AWESOME on my po'boy, IMHO.What about the oyster shooter, you're saying? I know! Well, I thought it would be a single oyster on a cracker with fixins. Nope. they brought me a tiny plastic cup with an oyster sitting in some cocktail sauce and some liquid. I smelled it, no smell.\"Um, excuse me, what's in this? Besides the oyster?\"\"Vodka. And cocktail sauce.\"Oh. Not what I was counting on. But it's my new favorite way to drink vodka, y'all!So go. Order some oysters (while you still can) and have fun. Don't be intimidated by the line.

It's most likely a staple for FQ drinkers looking for some nourishment to keep up the drinking, but for me it has a different place.

They're tasty enough, grilled with lemon and butter on top. It's a different way to eat oysters, I suppose. I still prefer the raw juiciness of uncooked oysters with tabasco sauce ;)Rice and beans - I had to try one of the Southern staples while I was in NoLa and I decided to try it here, unfortunately. Are southern style rice and beans supposed to lack flavor? Some salt might have helped. The beans and rice were utterly flavorless. Only the sausage saved it.

Instead, I had raw oysters which were very fresh, but saltier than oysters I've had elsewhere. We also had the charbroiled oysters which were delish, but Deanie's had more garlic and flavor. The shrimp/catfish po-boy was dry and needed tarter sauce, and the shrimp was a bit briney and possibly frozen.Seafood gumbo was salty and just ok...nothing to write home about. Jambalaya was good but also a bit dry. Sausage tasted local.

The po'boy came packed with plenty of deliciously deep fried shrimp and oyster, but they were just so lazily toppled onto a plain roll with a little bit of mayonnaise spread on top and a slice of lettuce. The shrimp and oysters were deep-fried very well, keeping a crispy, not-too-thick exterior with a hot, moist interior, but I felt so tempted to pick them out from the actual po'boy part of the sandwich. It just felt like a lack of effort for a sandwich and I'm sure there are better po'boys in the immediate neighborhood. We probably would have been better off just getting a fried plate.We came on a Sunday morning, just when they opened so the line was still relatively short and the crowd was still under control.

We went in and beat the line by a few minutes. We had a seat at the bar, next to a guy doing the oyster challenge (15 dozen club.. recently finished by Man vs. Food's Adam Richman). We started with one last shrimp po'boy and some raw oysters.After a little while, and when most of our food was all gone, the guys behind the bar strongly recommended the grilled oysters, which is what I wanted all along anyway ;) These were so freaking good. Butter and some kind of sauce that was super good, spicy almost... but suuuuper good. Grilled over raw for sure.

Their namesake implies an orientation around oysters, but they have a wide-ranging menu that also includes typical New Orleans dishes (gumbo, seafood \u00e9touff\u00e9e, jumbalaya, po' boys, etc.) as well as fried seafood preparations, including soft-shell crab.Atmosphere is a bit cramped and the restaurant is very dark. When I first walked in, the place smelled funny. After a few minutes, I got used to it, but it is initially off-putting.My lunch would be a half dozen chargrilled oysters ($11.50), a side of hush puppies ($2.25), and a bloody mary ($5.50).Acme's chargrilled oysters were very good - and similar to the charbroiled oysters I have previously had at Drago's. In this dish, the oysters are covered in a garlic butter sauce, sprinkled with parmesan (or romano?) cheese, and then grilled. Acme serves their oysters with a few pieces of white bread to mop up the buttery sauce left in the shells. I prefer Drago's charbroiled oyster dish, which seems to use more heat, resulting in a richer taste due to the resulting fond that sticks to the shell. This is obviously a knock-off of that.One of my oysters had a small pearl in it, a first for me.The hush puppies were good as well, though not special - straightforward, and about what you'd expect.Their bloody mary was a huge disappointment. In a city where I never had a bad bloody mary, Acme produced the first of those for me. It was appropriately spicy, but seemed like there were multiple ingredients missing (horseradish? lime juice? not enough tomato juice?), resulting in a thin cocktail that tasted nothing like the bloody marys I've had anywhere else in New Orleans.The highlight of my meal (sitting at the bar), however, was the friendly barstaff who made an effort to talk to everyone, and really do exude the genteel hospitality that this city is known for.", "Date": "2011-12-21", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Samuel B.", "ReviewID": "A4v7Nd94kIa6ZMvwOLD3bQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the privilege of going to this place twice during my stay in New Orleans. \u00a0The line can be a little time consuming so I recommend coming early. \u00a0Once you're seated though, it's completely worth the wait.

But the non-oyster food, was just kinda of average. I did try the char-grilled oysters that were grilled in the shell and covered in seasoned butter and grated romano cheese. They were really good.. I actually had a few, which for me -- the non-oyster-eater -- was a big accomplishment and says a lot about how good these are. Then I had the Acme \"10 Napkin Roast Beef\" Po-boy. It was messy, but I made it through in six napkins... partly because the bottom bun was so soggy from mayo and tomato, that I couldn't pick it up after a while and finished it with a fork. Overall, it would have been a lot better with mustard instead of mayo, so I wasn't that impressed. However, the hush puppies that came with it were AMAZING! I could have just eaten a bunch of those and been a very happy camper. On a second trip here (so the group I was with could eat more oysters), I had half of a turkey Po-boy (with no mayo and no tomato... I learned my lesson) and fries.

The oyster \"juice\" was so good, that we were practly licking it off the plate. But don't worry there are plenty more to eat. If your not up for tasting a little piece of heaven, then try the catfish po' boy. The cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish was a perfect combination with the deep fried catfish.Let me warn you!

There was plenty of lemon and a delicious cocktail sauce offered. Tabasco available on every table. I'm a bit of a purist so I just take a drop of lemon and a pinch of cocktail sauce. I have to admit that the oysters were huge and very filling. They were not the best but not the worse I've had...They were salty but not very briney (which I prefer). Still, among the large/huge sized oysters I've tried, these are the best. If you favorite oyster is kumamoto or a kushi, then you probably won't like these...

In October of 2010, yes post-BP spill, I wasn't letting that get in my way. I ordered the \"feast\"...a combination of catfish, oysters and shrimp and I was not disappointed. I felt like I was doing a challenge myself when the mountain of food came to my table.

My wife got the 1/2 and 1/2 platter with shrimp and oysters. Oh, and I also got the \"jambalaya\". My sandwich was ok-ish. Way too messy from the beef and that's all I tasted, even though there is supposed to be turkey, ham, and cheese on there as well. It was all buried in beef and beef gravy. Now about that \"jambalaya\", it was horrible. Not even close to what true jambalaya is supposed to be. And considering this is NEW ORLEANS, the jambalaya should be something more than an ice cream scoop of rice in a bowl that looks like it might have been sort of touched by tomato sauce, and definitely NO meat in it. For $3.99, I felt ripped off. As for my wife's dinner, when it says \"1/2 and 1/2\", you should expect the same amount of oysters as shrimp.... Not even close. The shrimp were the dominant seafood on the plate. If I had nothing to compare this visit to, I probably would just chalk it up to a bad night, but never go back.

I would have come very early to avoid the crowds, but another (non touristy) restaurant we tried to go to was closed for dinner. :(Their specialty is oysters obviously. We had a dozen of the raw oyster. They were nice and big. $10.99. Then we ordered a plate of jambalaya with chicken and sausage. Didnt' taste that much meat. And it was only ok. Small portion. We also had the seafood gumbo soup, supposed to have shrimp and crab but all i saw and tasted was the shrimp. That was just ok too. Finally we decided to try the grilled oysters since one of the shuckers kept raving about them. They put parmasean cheese and some butter and garlic over them. It was ok. I'd still stick with the raw ones. Pure and simple and healthy.I dont think this place is necessarily better than the other local faves. The fact that it's situated in a touristy area i think is always why there are lines. I dont think i'd wait in those lines again for it. Try to ask the locals where they go.One thing i was very concerned about is the food handling/hygience. As we sat at the bar, we saw the shuckers doing their shucking for an hour. They don't clean or spray down the oysters b4 they start on them. I mean, oh god, the do it on a stainless steel counter, which accumualated with sand and dirt, on the bags that the oysters come in.

These 12 delicious nuggets are topped with Parmesan cheese, garlic, and of course butter and broiled until the cheese is bubbly and crispy. They are brought out with thick slices of baguette. \u00a0No hot sauce needed for these puppies, i did dip my bread in the butter on the plate, top it with an oyster, and chip some melted cheese off the shell and down the hatch... We of course had a 10 napkin roast beef sandwich and a soft shell crab, both with hushpuppies. \u00a0Nothing bad to say about the sandwiches, just wish i had ordered 12 more oysters :) The roast beef sandwich was rich, full of flavor and I topped it with swiss cheese and sauteed onions. \u00a0PERFECTION!

I begged and pleaded to go elsewhere but it was around 10 or 11 at night after a Hornets game and we didn't have a lot of options. I told them we should at least go to Deanie's instead (we saw Deuce McAllister and his guests entering Deanie's when we passed) but they'd had it before and wanted to try something new. SO...we went to Acme. It took 10 minutes before our server acknowledged us, even though he paid a lot of attention to the 50-somethings we were sharing a table with. I guess a table of 20-somethings isn't as enticing to a server who makes $2.50/hr and lives off tips, although I always tip upwards of 20% if the service is worth it. We finally put in our drink orders (all of us got beer) and ordered a dozen raw oysters to start. Now, as a disclaimer, I used to work in a high-volume seafood restaurant and we would pre-shuck our oysters and store them in a fridge until they were used. I'm sure Acme does the same thing due to the ridiculous amount of oyster ordered. However, one thing Acme obviously doesn't do is at least spritz their oysters before they're brought to the table. The dozen oysters we received had obviously been sitting in a fridge for hours and had taken on a rubbery consistency due to lack of moisture. They also hadn't been properly cut from the bottom shell so the meat was still attached--meaning the oyster was shredded with the oyster fork when trying to remove them from the shell. There was also only 11 oysters on our tray of what was supposed to be \"a dozen\"...and the server wasn't very apologetic about any of the above. If you're going to have \"oyster\" in the name of your restaurant...get them right, PLEASE!The food (entrees consisted of oyster poboy, shrimp poboy, gumbo) was so very, very mediocre and tragically overpriced.

I wouldn't have darkened their door except that my family was in town, and for some reason they have a mortal fear of traveling outside the Quarter, and this place always has a line outside the door, so they assumed it was going to be good. The line outside is totally misleading: the restaurant makes everyone wait outside for a table, even when there are plenty of empty tables inside! It is complete theater! They just want to look like they are constantly busy, so they make everyone wait outside and the hosts seat parties at a purposely...shall we say \"deliberate\"...pace.Inside is a bustling, high-volume operation, with a menu that contains all the NOLA seafood standards. During our visit, we had a dozen raw oysters ($13.50), and they were good...shucked in such a way that the liquor remained, served with all the normal accoutrements. For my entree, I had a fried soft shell crab platter ($16.99) with french fries and cole slaw. The crab tasted very good and fresh, and though it was fried perhaps a little too \"vigorously,\" it had a nice cornmeal crust. The fries and slaw were so-so. Another member of my party had the Peace Maker po-boy ($12.99), which contained fried oysters, shrimp and a Tabasco-infused mayo. I had a bite and it was pretty delicious...if I ever find myself at Acme again, I'm going to order this. Another member of my party had the New Orleans Medley ($12.99), a sampler trio of gumbo, jambalaya and red beans & rice. They were all competent versions of NOLA classics, but definitely nothing to write home about.For dessert we shared a bread pudding with whiskey sauce ($4.99). It was OK...again, I've had much better. It was a little bit dense and oversweet. The restaurant is very noisy during dinner time, and service is brusque but competent.

The crawfish hush puppies were perfectly crisp on the outside with melt-in-your mouth crawfish filling. The chargrilled oysters were out-of-this world with the oyster sitting in its own juices mixed with a garlic butter sauce and topped with melted romano cheese. For entrees, we got the deep-fried crawfish Po-boy, the Variety Plate (with samplings of gumbo, jambalaya, smoked sausage, and red beans on rice), and the crawfish etoufee.

The place is a lot bigger then it looked on tv. When you walk towards the back they have a grill with a glass window so you can watch the cook make their chargrilled oysters with butter and cheese. They looked incredible but we didn't try them. Seemed to be really popular though. Make sure you don't mind being elbow to elbow with people since it's jam packed with people! It does add to the atmosphere I must say. My husband ordered the beans and rice poopa. It was a french bread bowl with beans and rice and a huge sausage link on top. It was delicious.
