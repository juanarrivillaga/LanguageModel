We decided to sit outside even though there was light rain off and on. The staff checked on us frequently to let us know they would be happy to move us inside. After browsing the menu we could not decide between all of the amazing menu items so we asked the server what he recommended - he was great. Also asked if we had any food allergies or diet restrictions before putting our order in. Even though we did not, I was impressed that he asked. Coffee is excellent! The weekend brunch special recommended by our server was a pulled pork sausage braised in maple & soy on a bed of grits with \u00a0greens and a sunny side egg on top. Absolutely incredible.

I always think it's a hassle to get to Logan Square from Lincoln Park, so I never bother unless it's going to be a special occasion. My friend and her family were visiting from HK, so decided to take them here. Came on a Monday night, and around 6, so there was absolutely no wait, even for a party of 6. I ordered the Eye in the Sky whiskey cocktail, which has Thai chili and mint in it-- very sweet, but I requested for extra chili for a strong kick to balance it out. Sooooo dang good. One of my favorite cocktails I've had here! But then again I've been loving spicy drinks for the last year or so. 'Had the greens and melon salad, bone marrow, ricotta gnuddi, the braised rabbit. For big plates, we got soft shell crab, seared hebi, and NY strip steak. Overall, the presentation of everything was amazing and my friend's family really liked the steak, bone marrow and hebi.I think this place would be great for a date, but I don't think I'd want to do a big group here again, the food was more suitable for individuals or couples rather than everybody trying a bit of something.", "Date": "2014-07-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "s r.", "ReviewID": "oJeJzd8icAWQVZ8D0YGv7w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been here a few times and I'll keep going back. Personally I would stick with the small plates and just order a bunch of them. The bar snacks are great too. I've had somewhat varying experiences and that's normal. If you order 6-8 plates some will be better than others. Maybe one or two may be underwhelming. It can happen. However the last time I was here each and every plate was a hit. So that means they are still trying and they are still evolving. The menu changes seasonally and the nature of a restaurant means that there will be some experimentation and some times a dish may not work for you. Every now and then something may not go perfectly. Now that they are on Michelin Guide's radar I'm sure they are working very hard on maintaining consistency. Technically the Michelin star diners can drop in unannounced. But I think word gets around sometimes and also I'd bet they'd have a hard time blending in here. I can only hope this place doesn't sell out or become complacent.

Only negative is that they don't take reservations and will not sit you down until your whole party is there. At busy places this is pretty standard but it's still a pet peeve of mine. This is why our party ended up eating at the bar(there were 8 of us). This is pretty standard, I've come to realize because all the staff was used to it and it flowed from us having drinks at the bar to us eating dinner really smoothly. The bartender was phenomenal, went through explaining how all the drinks we ordered were made, all his favorites on the menu and even gave us all a complimentary shot to celebrate the birthday girl.

But it's also possible that eating brunch at one (especially one that reads as another pork-centric gastropub) doesn't count.Longman & Eagle's brunch (read: menu split into breakfast, lunch, and booze) is served every day of the week. I love that! And so does everyone else - early on a Tuesday afternoon, I was shocked by the healthy crowd of patrons. Apparently in Chicago, expecting quiet restaurants during awkward weekday hours doesn't work. Still, the place is gigantic (they have an inn!) and the friendly hostess seated us immediately.The bloody mary was excellent. It was served with a tiny glass of what tasted like PBR. I had no idea what to do with it, but upon tasting the perfectly spiced bloody mary, destroying it by turning it into a michelada would've been a horrible idea.The Tete de Cochon was a roulade of tender pork ringed with a gelatinous layer of head cheese, topped with a sunny side up egg, baby arugula, parsley, and a prawn - and the best part, bathed tableside in lemony, porky jus that pulled it all together. This was delicious - a translation of something that looks a bit more \"cuisine\" but still fully satisfies the comfort-and-familiarity requirements of Brunch (and its eaters). Actually, the brunch menu still leans toward familiarity. Get their versions of challah French toast or eggs benedict if you need; the Tete de Cochon, having both French and pig's head in its name, may have been the most \"exotic\" item. I thought my friend's pork belly torta was unexciting - but then again, my life maybe includes amazing tortas too regularly.Prices were so reasonable. At home, another tired brunch plate would've cost the same $14 as my lively, beautiful plate here! To boot, the bloody mary was served in a pint glass and $8.

Sitting in the pass for a while, huh?

I don't understand half of the items offered on the menu. First I was here for beer with friends. Then I was here for a dinner date. Last, I was here for breakfast. Longman & Eagle is just crowded. I don't care who goes there or how the staff behaves. I'm just frustrated with the sushi restaurant style seating. Again, you're literally right on top of the person sitting next to you. The last time I came here for breakfast, my friend needed more room without saying (he's a big guy) so thankfully we were seated a reasonable distance away from the people next to us. The best time to visit for dinner is to get there just before the kitchen is ready to serve it. My boyfriend at the time had brought me here and it was nice to be seated and have the room to spread out. It was winter and when you have big bulky jackets, it's nice having the room to keep them next to you. I don't think they have a coat check anyway. The sun sets through the windows during this time of year, and it will cast a cozy warming light across your table. \u00a0Like I said, I never remember what I've ordered, but everything that comes out of the kitchen is either good, or a surprising experience. Not bad, but something I don't care to revisit. The one dish I have never had, but I see lots of people ordering, is the bone marrow appetizer. I just can't forget a large bone standing erect or perpendicular to a plate while watching diners gaze curiously before they penetrate the center of its contents with a fork. I can't tell if they wonder what the appropriate way is to eat it; or if they are having second thoughts regarding the texture alone. Nevertheless, it's awesome watching people eat it. I've seen this two times and I don't suspect it will ever get old.I feel like if I ask my waiter to explain my dish further, that I won't want to eat it. It's best for me to just have it served and eat it. Again, I would never say that anything here is bad, just not filling. I was raised on large breakfasts and I am a meat and potatoes girl. All of the dishes served here are a little too small for my taste. I would say they charge too much as well, but I think they just put a lot of work into making their odd meat choices moist and tender enough to eat. Rather, the cuts of meat they're using. \u00a0I wouldn't try this for breakfast, but if you visit here for dinner, bring a case of cold PBR for the kitchen. They just might return the favor. I have the kinds of mixed feelings for Longman and Eagle which will always keep me coming back. I like how this restaurant is always keeping my tastebuds on their toes, and my sense of food texture \u00a0always in the dark in terms of what's to come.

That doesn't mean you need to avoid giving good service because your food and drinks are exquisite.Other places with such high ratings work for it.Our service was assuming, snobby and barely average.Your bartender with dark hair, pretty, pale skin and red lipstick doesn't make eye contact, doesn't smile and is offended when you ask a question. Then drops the check on the bar without saying thank you. You should have your Michelin star removed for that kind of service. I worked at 2 shitty normal Irish pubs during school for 10 years and if I ever served like that I would get yelled at and rightfully so. I made great money because I treated our customers thankfully for coming in.Remember this: These are your clients, not your enemies. Act accordingly.Then our server was ok but our meal was $155 and she didn't even ask how it was and did not sincerely thank us for coming in. Just kept asking if we wanted more drinks when our glasses were still half full. These are expensive, sipping cocktails, not \"jack and cokes\".An example: when you begin the service, based on what the client wants to drink, talk about what you love or based on typical preferences : boozy, sweet, tarte, whatever make it up just make it look like you give a shit.Once the drinks are delivered , sure ask about food but ask about what the clients like, more meaty/veggie/spicy portion size. This is not fast food, this is an expensive once in a rare time meal and you're making it seem like we just eat here all the time and buy a tiny $18 \"cauliflower entree\".When different servers would put the dishes on the table, they would just drop them on the table, not make eye contact and go off a recorded line about what the food is with zero feeling. Pretty bland and unattractive for clients.

From nose to tail, Longman & Eagle is a top-notch dining experience. It may have a Michelin star to its name, sure, but the fine folks at L&E don't need your fancy white tablecloths, your complex reservation system, or your belief that a shot of whiskey should cost ten-fifty. Instead, L&E is a come, wait, eat, enjoy type place. Your meal should amble along. Your conversation should be a focus. Your drinks should be refreshing. And your food should be good, damn good.L&E keeps ridiculously long hours, which is a good thing. Coming during peak times (weekend brunch, nightly dinner) will cost you in value money of time. Both the interior and exterior dining areas are small, much more conducive for parties of 2 to 4. Reservations can be made only if you're staying at L&E's inn.But if you're faced with a wait, that's okay. Spend some quality time at the bar instead. L&E is a whiskey/bourbon lover's paradise. It offers a multitude of shots (size, not consumption time) for a mere three Washington's. Not that there's not good stuff, too. Staring at the bar back is enough entertainment for me. L&E also offers cocktails, a plethora of draught, bottle and can craft beers, and a wine list to boot.Service is first rate from entry to exit. The hostesses were graciously accommodating as we bounced back between a 2 and 4 table request, the bartender was delightfully cheeky, the waitress was amazing at getting our raucous table through the night.But if the rating were solely about the food, L&E would still score a five-star review. L&E may have a Michelin Star to its name, but prices are surprisingly reasonable. If I had to make a comparison, I liken it to the amazing Barley Swine in Austin. Once you get that first dish, you'll be a believer.We splurged on a few appetizers, the highlight being the roasted marrow bones. I'd put L&E's a cut below Au Cheval, but better than Purple Pig. The bones were smaller than the latters', but the accompanying bacon shallot jam was divine. Other underrated aspects of the appetizer selection was the chile vinaigrette plus whipped feta combination in the spring melon and cucumber salad, the perfectly fried quail egg atop the ricotta gnuddi, and the exultingly melt-worthy goodness of the cheese gourgeres.Honestly, you could make your living on small plates alone. We tried but two main courses, the fried chicken roulade and the famous wild boar sloppy joe. The crispy skin encasing the roulade puts fried chicken joints like Harold's to shame, not to mention the \"High Life\" gel that you'd probably drink after eating Harold's--yes, that's Miller's finest. Who needs duck fat fries? L&E's tribute to McDonald's past goes beef-fat fries, which are as good as they sound. The sloppy joe is certainly interesting. Paying 15 bones for a sloppy joe is a little like paying 10 bucks for a glorified frito pie at Au Cheval. But take away that percunious mentality and you have a dang fine sloppy joe.Longman & Eagle is one of the best meals you'll have in Chicago.

I stumbled across this restaurant when doing a quick research before my business trip out to Chi-town and thought I just had to go. I even felt reassured when I went to Bavettes (OMG Delish btw) and the server said that this place was where I needed to be. \u00a0So you can imagine my surprise when I was left with a disappointed palette, not so great customer experience, and a pricey tab to top it off.The food: it's dressed up pub food.. the scene here is drinks.. they do have an awesome drink list (and prices to match the fancy concoctions). \u00a0But the food is essentially something you'd have when you're thowing back a few at a local tavern, except it's prettied up.. example: Steak tartare.. their version of the big mac.. a brioche bun, minced meat, a special sauce, diced up pickles, potato shoe string fries, and aerated cheese. \u00a0Creative? Absolutely! To die for flavors? not at all.. props to making it taste like a big mac, literally! \u00a0But it completely lost the flavor of the tartare.. after adding all the sauce, bun, etc you are left with an overpriced big mac for a portion of the size. \u00a0You'll get heavy items there too like bone marrow, beer battered smelt, and even sloppy joes.. but nothing stuck out.. while drinking yes, it will hit the spot.. but it will also hit your wallet's spot too for how pricey it is for the quality of what you get.The drinks: As mentioned.. awesomeness! Creative drinks, innovative flavors, and a scene to match.. but pricey. \u00a0The service: Overall it was okay.. at first it appeared average.. nothing bad stuck out, but then again the server didn't go over the top to stick out either, which is fine. \u00a0But here's what rubbed me the wrong way. \u00a0The tables are quite close together, so towards the end of my meal, I overhear our server telling this table that just sat down about their drink specials.. we're talking about $1 beers and something else ridiculously cheap.. maybe $2 or $3 whiskey shots? Either way, I was confused because she didn't proactively mention that to our table. When I asked her if that special just came on, thinking it might be a late night happy hour offer, she said no. \u00a0She continued to say that she didn't bother mentioning it as I didn't look like I would drink a cheap beer or whiskey. \u00a0Stereotyping.. hmm I wasn't a fan of that.. I was there for business and dressed professionally but that doesn't give her the right to pick for me what I want..and I really wasn't a fan of that fact that she continued to let us order $15-$19 drinks per round, when I would have thrown a cheap beer back easily if I knew they had an awesome deal going on. \u00a0For how much awesome food and drinks Chicago has to offer, I would look elsewhere to see what places you can find. 4 drinks total and 2 small plates later, we were looking at a $100 bill.....

Luckily there was no wait so we were seated right away. THE DRINKS...are STRONG! I'm kind of a lightweight so I could probably have split the drink with 2 other people and still walked out drunk. Needless to say I didn't finish my drink but it was delicious. I can't remember the name but it was some type of citrus drink infused with several different liquors. The food is very different. It comes out in different shapes and the portions aren't as large as the prices insinuate. First, I should preface with the fact that I've never had so much foie gras in my life. I think I had more foie gras in the hour I was eating here than the past 27 years of my existence and IT WAS DELICIOUS! We start out with some small plates-scallops w/ foie gras, lobster canneloni, and burrata. We asked the server if it would be enough for us for dinner. It wasn't. I think this would've been a good pre-workout meal it was pretty small. However, the food is very artistic. The scallops were arranged on only one side of the plate with truffle and lard designs. The burrata came with a truffle butter/spread which was to die for but again small. And the lobster canneloni was decorated with small veggies. The food was great but wasn't enough to qualify as a filling meal. So we ordered the fried chicken. This was an itneresting one...They molded the chicken in a circle shape and served it with whipped sriracha that looked like a salmon colored whipped cream. The taste was just like sriracha but not as heavy. It also came with some high life gel which alone tastes awful. However, when you mixed it with the modified chicken, it gave it a nice kick in your mouth. To end the evening we ordered the foie gras ice cream and apple tart. I never knew fat flavored ice cream could taste so good but it did! I didn't care too much for the apple tart or the clear gel or the vanilla cube that came with it but the ice cream was a creamy indulgent \"I probabaly shouldn't eat this\" kind of amazing.", "Date": "2014-05-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Cristina S.", "ReviewID": "kcnoPP0uhIN_QEWhbElyQw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Party of 4 on a Tuesday night and we couldn't be more satisfied.

As you walk in, you see the long, dark wood bar and soft lighting that adds to this rustic feel. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles, and I have tried this dish many other places like Fork and Acre as well as Wolf Peach in WI, and I can say that their take on this sweet and savory dish has been the best. The chicken skin is seasoned well with herbs and spices that heighten it's crispy yet light texture. The chicken itself is cooked well, juicy and not over- or underdone. The waffle underneath it all was a good size and what you'd expect from a waffle. The nice surprise on the dish is the sweet potato and pork belly hash. The pork belly is cooked up crispy and the potatoes were cooked perfectly--sweet and not too soft or crispy. This hash added to the sweet and savory flavor explosion without making it overwhelming. In fact, it kind of balanced the sweetness from the maple syrup, which was good but maybe if they added some spice to it the dish could be a little more complex.The other dish we had was the housemade sausage. It was one link, but pretty good size. It was tasty and definitely a fancy version of breakfast sausage you can't find most places. The other dish we had was the Duck Egg and Duck Confit. The duck egg was rich, of course, and there was this light, almost sweet and herbal sauce that tied it all together in a salty and yummy bow. I can tell why this place would be so popular for dinner.

The overall taste was greasy and salty and too much sriracha. The beer jelly doesn't have much taste and added nothing. There wasn't any balance to the meal. I would have loved some whipped potatoes with a bit of aerated sriracha on top. And some sort of veggies would have been nice. The only thing I found myself enjoying was the duck fat biscuits.

The lobster was perfectly cooked and the flavor was excellent, while the pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender and came with shrimp and cheese grits, both standouts in their own right.

I adore Doughnut Vault and Firecakes and until my visit to OSB I haven't found anyone who can even hold a candle to the aforementioned. OSB definitely can, they are a doughnut player and they are freaking serious about it. They don't go for the sugar overload, they don't over glaze everything, they shoot for the density and depth of real flavor. They are good. Really good. They do both yeast and cake doughnuts and rotate the flavors weekly. I got a couple to try and meant to only eat half of each. Um, I ate both. And washed them down with delicious dark matter coffee. \u00a0All I can say is that I'm glad they only offer them on Sundays and I'm glad I don't live too close to Logan Square, otherwise it could be a problem.

As I tried to sneak in that day, the doorman gave the stubble on my poorly groomed face a once-over and realized that I wasn't serious enough about pogonotrophy to be a part of the bearded brotherhood blogging their experience with old typewriters and then taking pictures of their papers via Instagram.My turn to eat at L&E would eventually come and the wait was so worth it. My good mate and I strolled in on a Friday night a few weeks back. We found the place to be packed, which wasn't a surprise. We elected to stand near the bar until two seats opened up (which took over an hour) but big efffin' deal. The whiskey flight we ordered was so wonderfully woody and peat-fire-warm on a bitterly cold night, I could have spent another hour on another flight and time would have become irrelevent. The delay wasn't entirely the fault of L&E's limited bar space or that the patrons occupying it took their sweet-ass time eating. We had a chance to sit earlier than we did, but we passed so a pregnant woman -- who was just about cooked enough to shat out the wee one at any given moment -- could sit, which was really, really hard to do because it spun our moral compasses in directions of disarray as we eyed beautiful dishes fly from the kitchen and land on tables. \u00a0Now, pressed for time, we shared the lobster parfait and the bone marrow small plates. Wowza! Total food boner, you guys! It was the first time I ever tried marrow and let me tell you, I'll be back for more, even if I have to pry a cow femur from the jowls of a starving wolf to do so. After spooning it out, the marrow, you smear it on toast with a blueberry/caramelized onion jam and some sea salt that accompanies the bone and ... and it was phenomenal (think of a smoky butter and jam buscuit). The lobster parfait, like an attractive woman wearing \"fuck me\" boots and sitting alone at an empty bar, requires attention and discussion too. It was super sexy. There was these huge cubes of bacon lardon (think: bacon jerky) that accompanied the sweetness of the lobster meat and the silkiness of the (parsnip? -- thank you, whiskey) puree so very well.

We see the happy faces walking in and out and we see it's name appear in every culinary publication under the sun yet, GASP, we had never entered the hallowed doors. Yesterday, however, that all changed and, as the saying goes, \"once you know, you can't unknow.\" Entering into an establishment with high expectations usually leads to disappointment, although the level of disappointment varies by experience. That was not the case at L&E, it was actually quite the contrary. L&E lived up to its reputation and, in some cases, exceeded it. Having read about it in Travel & Leisure, Esquire, GQ, Chicago Mag, CS, Michigan Ave, ad nauseum, we were expecting a house of well-balanced and flavorful food with the quirky (yet attentive) service we've come to expect from our beloved Logan Square. That is precisely what was delivered. The staff donned various plaid attire, fabulous hair, and mandatory ink for the neighborhood along with a deep understanding of the menu items and the patience to convey this knowledge to their guests. We sat at the bar and they took a team approach to helping us and each member of the wait staff was as helpful and eager to help as the previous. \u00a0The decor was spot-on for the neighborhood, being a mix of an old-timey feel with a modern and eclectic mix.For food, we stopped in for just a drink but the food was WAY too good to pass up. We ended up with 2 drinks (Wilson's Last Drink and Gilligan's Happy Place) and found that both were well-thought out and as described by the bartender. They were also quick to check and make sure that we were satisfied with our selections, which is always a sign of a good 'tender. For food, I NEVER pass up a good pretzel and since I've had that one, I may become more of a pretzel snob because DAMN! Between L&E, Table Donkey & Stick, and Owen & Engine, I am living in pretzel heaven!! The pretzel was light and fluffy on the inside and had the nice, brown crust that popped when pulled and was paired with a beer cheese that was awesome. (SIDE NOTE: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU EXPLORE LOGAN THROUGH PRETZELS AND BEER, IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE A GERMAN PARTY IN YOUR MOUTH.) We also tried the Lamb Tartare which was like a high falooting reuben from foodie heaven. Just say yes to the lamb tartare. Pickled olives? Strange? Maybe... Delicious? You bet your ass they were. When Adam saw a Slagel Farms burger he was hooked... I told him to just get it and we'd call it dinner. He did and he was SO glad that he did. They used an aged cheddar that added a depth to the flavor that he described as \"mm mmm mmm.\" When he says nothing but a sound with his mouth full, it's pretty much a resounding positive review. MY ONLY COMPLAINT: No fried egg option on the burger. That is the one thing that drives Adam crazy about the Owen & Engine burger, so it's hard to compare them without being able to compare apples to apples.Final Verdict: The food critics were right, 5 stars all around, except for the long waits that can be had on weekends... but we live around the corner, so we'll make do for a Monday/Tuesday kinda thing.", "Date": "2014-04-08", "Author_Location": "Logan Square, Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Tina L.", "ReviewID": "XwDQecxg09ufPqNiJbehsw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this place!

Our server was great -- very knowledgeable about each dish's ingredients and offered excellent suggestions.SUNNYSIDE DUCK EGG HASH I thought I was going to be underwhelmed by this dish, but it wowed me! The two duck eggs you get are perfectly cooked with ooey gooey runny yolks. There's yukon gold potatoes, shallots and chunks of duck confit along with a gorgeous black truffle vinaigrette that took this dish to the next level. I should've taken the servers advice to order the side of fresh toast, but I was being stubborn and ended up flagging her down later on. The toast was really fresh and served with whipped butter and house made raspberry jam. This was the perfect vehicle for dipping into the egg yolks and sopping up that delicious vinaigrette. CHICKEN AND WAFFLESThis dish was a winner as well! The flavor of the waffle was amazing with hints of cinnamon in the batter? The texture was perfect -- crispy outside, fluffy inside. My only gripe is that it says waffles on the menu, but it only comes with one. There are however two pieces of chicken that come with an order, a drumstick and thigh. Again, the flavors were wonderful -- the chicken was delightfully crispy, moist and juicy. I appreciated the subtle touch of grated Parmesan cheese on top to add a punch of salt. The consistency of the maple syrup was viscous without being overly thick, which complemented the chicken and waffle well. The dish is also served with a sweet potato hash studded with crispy bits of pork belly which was amazing. Wish I didn't have to share this dish!

While the presentation was beautiful, the meal did not come together. The chicken was mushed together like a potted ham wrapped in greasy chicken skin, and I found myself yearning for tender meat and crispy skin that simply wasn't there. The predominant flavors were greasy and salty, but not in a delicious way. The acid elements (apple bits, beer jelly) that should have balanced the grease fell flat- the beer jelly in particular was viscous, oily, and utterly flavorless, contributing nothing to the dish other than tasting disturbingly like KY Jelly. The sriracha mousse was ok, but there was too much of it, and it didn't tie the dish together. The best part actually were the tasty duck fat biscuits, which weren't actually biscuits but more like fritters or beignets.

I was a little skeptical about the ricotta balls... I worried that they would be too cheesy with an overpowering taste or weird texture. But they turned out a-okay! Phew. Although not my favorite out of the plate, just glad they tasted better than I had expected. Remember, always start with low expectations so that you won't be as upset or disappointed when the dish doesn't isn't up to your standards. :) My favorite items on the plate were the mushrooms and greens. Healthy and tasty is the best combo.Black sesame and doughnut. Interesting combo - never had black sesame with doughnuts, let alone as a doughnut, before. When I think of black sesame, I just think ASIAN! Except to my surprise, I found it at an \"All American\" restaurant. The dessert wasn't bad, but it didn't wow me either. The doughnut were very cakey and dense. When getting doughnuts, I prefer the fluffy yeast ones as opposed to the cakey ones. If you like cake doughnuts, then you would like this.This is not your typical Michelin Starred restaurant. It is very... loud and crowded... as opposed to the nice, spacey, quiet, calm, and comfortable sit down dinner one would normally expect from a dining experience at a Michelin Starred restaurant. The lighting of the restaurant is very very dim, practically black, practically. It is also hard to get the server's attention due to the loudness of the restaurant as well as tons of other tables he/she needs to attend to.

This time we came in for dinner-ish and drinks. We waited half an hour for a table on a Saturday at 10 pm, pretty good. Drinks: Tried the death cookies and pony truss. The death cookies was too fruity and light for me, the pony truss was great, but I wasn't a huge fan of the combination of flavors. I've had better (smoother and better combinations). Still pretty good. \u00a0Food: We tried the meatballs, Gruyere cheese balls, foie gras, bone marrow, and Ricotta Gnuddi. My favorites were the meatballs and the gruyere cheese balls. The foie gras were good too. The bone marrow was rather tasteless, but still ok. The ricotta gnuddi was a tad dry. Bar: I understand it was a busy night, but the bartender took ages and gave us the drinks in batches. The drinks were good though. Service: Our server was awesome, great service, very polite, and he checked in on us just often enough. We always had water in our glasses. One complaint is that in the last hour, they tried 3 times to clear our plates while we were still working on them. I don't understand it. It annoyed me a lot.

To be honest, the lamb tasted very similar to a tuna tartare, which made me love it even more. \u00a0But it was the combination of the all the ingredients that made this dish phenomenal. \u00a0It's not pretty, but the best way to eat this is to break the yolk over the lamb, mix everything up so it's all one giant mess, and eat it bite by bite with the rye bread. \u00a0Absolutely amazing. \u00a0Highly recommend.Roasted Marrow Bones with Bacon Shallot Jam - My fiance loved this one, and I found it...not bad. \u00a0But to be honest, I couldn't get over the marrow bones and the consistency was a little too soft and raw tasting. \u00a0He thoroughly enjoyed it though, so if marrow doesn't skeeve you out, then definitely order this as it's one of their best sellers.Dry Aged NY Strip - We finished with the steak entree. \u00a0The steak was tender and perfect, but the real winner in this dish was the thinly sliced scalloped potatoes. \u00a0The accompanying sides were phenomenal with this dish, and I would have ordered it just for the sides.For dinner cocktails, we went with the Old Fashioned and the Root and Rye. \u00a0Shawn described the Root and Rye perfectly, basically as tasting like Root Beer without the carbonation. \u00a0But to be honest, it tasted more just like straight Jagermeister and wasn't a favorite of the night. \u00a0The Old Fashioned was excellent. \u00a0Stiff and strong, but also delicious.While the food was fantastic, and the bourbon was amazing...I have to say that the true winner in this experience was the service and personal attention. \u00a0Phil came by to check on us multiple times and even came by with a rare Old Fitzgerald bottle (the last of its kind) to give my fiance a free taste since he enjoys Stitzel Weller so much. \u00a0I mean...who does that?? \u00a0The amount he poured was easily worth $30. \u00a0Shawn was very friendly and attentive, was great about describing dishes and making recommendations. \u00a0Our water was never empty. \u00a0And random staff members would stop by to check on us and wish my fiance a happy birthday. \u00a0His mind was blown and so was mine. \u00a0Thank you L&E for making me look like a great fiance and giving him an amazing birthday! \u00a0We will definitely be back.", "Date": "2013-08-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Daniel S.", "ReviewID": "sUi3vVpRautQCuO0ulrL3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Certainly not the traditional Michelin atmosphere that one would expect - that is not a bad thing though!

He was intrigued by the interesting meats and new twist on old dishes. I was intrigued by the well-stocked whiskey bar. However, I don't eat much meat and I'm not a fan of waiting an hour plus for a table so I've always vetoed L&E.We finally went last week on my partner's birthday. There wasn't that long of a wait, probably due to the not-so-great weather, and we ordered some drinks at the bar while we waited for the table. L&E has that look that seems to be so popular in Chicago lately -- new restaurants designed and furnished to look lived-in and old. The chairs were worn past the young age of the restaurant. Also, the staff must be instructed to wear plaid which gives the place a weird TGIFriday's kind of feel. I'm really not into the kitschy waiter outfits--not necessary. Adding to the meh atmosphere was the broken speaker overhead where we were sat down. It was blown out so anytime the bass hit it crackled and fuzzed like an overused car stereo system. The cocktails were okay, but I've had better at other area eateries and bars (Whistler, Bavette's, Au Cheval). They just didn't seem like they were mixed quite right and weren't very well balanced. We had an Old Fashioned and a None the Blacker (I think that was the name). Decent, but not spectacular. Our dinner had the same average theme. Everything was okay, but nothing was fantastic. I ordered arctic char and while it was good, it was forgettable. My partner had the wild boar sloppy joe with beef fat fries. He liked it, but also didn't seem too excited. I've had duck fat fries before and those are pretty delicious, but for some reason the beef fat fries just seemed to taste...dirty? greasy? to me. The dessert was also only okay. The fois gras ice cream and the poached pears that garnished the plate were fantastic, but the \"pop tart\" was closer to the pantry pastry than it should have been and very far from imaginative dessert fare. The bill wasn't bad, only about $100 for the whole shebang, but I don't really think it was worth it. I would suggest other restaurants for casual atmosphere with updated good food and am unlikely to recommend L&E to anyone or return there.

Usually that would be a deal breaker for me but the back bar has great snacks (meatballs with polenta and pesto? yum!) and the drinks were fantastic no matter what you got. (I got a gin fizz and a dark and stormy -- both great!) We were there for a birthday party and eight of us took over the back and had a fantastic time while we waited for the table.Wednesday night, three of us went around 9, and the place was still packed, full bar and tables. 1.5-hour wait for three people. Again, we enjoyed waiting in the back with some drinks and apps -- just don't go there expecting a quick meal. We got to the table a little earlier than expected. We ordered the bacon cheese burger, and the seared Albacore tuna. As the boyfriend said, the burger was decent. I had the tuna and, at $28, I was expecting a little more than three 1.5x1.5x3-in tuna slices, two small hearts of palm and some sort of marinated nut. Basically, little more than the amount I'd expect for an appetizer. Don't get me wrong, the flavor-pairing was spot on, and I ended up being very satisfied (having had some of the pretzel, a meatball, and this) but it was pretty skimpy for the price point, and I was a little disappointed that it was over-seared (almost cooked through in parts, actually).I must say, the service is spot on, the server was enthusiastic about her suggestions, and super-friendly. The bartenders are helpful, creative, and willing to go slightly off menu to find you a drink you'll like. I'd go there again, but would probably just stick with the slightly more price-point-appropriate appetizers (of which there are plenty, and could easily be enjoyed tapas-style).", "Date": "2014-04-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jack P.", "ReviewID": "JABgOlA2RrPzxJ-qXz-IfA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At the prompting of one of my Logan Square chums, I finally made it over here to L&E.

You walk into a festive yet unassuming bar room and into the din of conversation and neighborhood revelry. I fell in \"like\" immediately. The menu is amazing for a gastro pub. I can always gauge that by the number of things I don't recognize. A few examples: Pickled Sea Beans,Tot Soi, Werp Greens.

My tastes are just moving more towards vegan than towards organ meats and piggy parts. But, hey, it helps narrow down the choices.Items which did catch my eye were Seared Scallops, Ricotta Gnudddi, Blue Crab Ravioli, the bar snacks of Slagel Farm meatballs with Polenta, the artisanal cheese selection, the warm cheeses Gougeres. And of course the Boar Sloppy Joe. Because I can't bring myself to order a sloppy joe out, I settled for the Slagel Family (who seem to be everywhere here!) Farms Burger. The full entree items, all in the $17-32 range, all sound like magical pairings of flavor, texture and spices. Not your standard pub fare. So we sat at the bar, had our burgers and beers, and chatted up the bartenders a little. The burger is really unique and delicious, as are the fries. Not like any other bar burger I've had.

There is a refrigerator in the room and a snack bar, and they also give you two tokens for free whiskey pours downstairs.

All in all, we were really happy we chose to stay the night. Rooms fill up quick (we booked ours over a month in advance) so plan accordingly.Parking was easy -- there is a lot across the street with ample spots, and we were there on a Sunday night so it was free until Monday morning. Only annoying thing was that we had to feed the meter at midnight, and it only lets you pay 10 hours at a time, so I had to feed it again at 10am (one hour before checkout).

Sis and BF tell me it might be crowded on this particular Sunday bc of the race so I call ahead. Hostess tells me I can EASILY get a seat at the bar as a party of one. But the wait for a table is at least a 1.5 hrs. So I walk on over (10 min later). I get there say hello to said hostess and start scoping out bar for a seat. She says yea, all these people are waiting for their tables so you'll be fine. Ok. Start waiting. Waiting. Waiting......... \u00a0No luck. All the people waiting for tables keep snatching my potential bar stools!! I decide, ok I really want to eat here but I'll wait until it's 9pm and go to a neighboring restaurant for snack and beer. I come back. It's exactly the same wait time and lack of bar seating. Hostess tells me oh, well there's our OSB. Btw, this stands for \"off site bar\" (not outside bar). This place is way more chill and I could eat here, except it's just apps! I really want to try their food! So I kindly explain my experience to \"Mae\" working at OSB. She seems very understanding and says ok don't worry we will fix this. She takes me back up front and tells bartender to hold me a place at the bar once it opens. He says ok.................. But then a couple of guys I think were his friends show up. I'm neglected and after waiting an additional 10-15 min I decide to give up. :( Boo.

The highlights were the bone marrow and king crab salad. Both carried different flavor but balanced each other well. But seriously, order anything on this menu, I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed. The drinks though, were a different story, both in a good and bad way. They were delicious and super strong. I suffered a small incident in the end due to over-consumption of alcoholic beverage, resulting in bot being able to have dessert.

\u00a0Because of the wood paneling. \u00a0Bathroom is nice.Okay so back to the most important thing FOOD. \u00a0The menu changes literally every week (I know because I have been there!) but some things stay on because they are good.Get this:DEFINITELY, every time, small plate: Bone Marrow: with a bacon-lemon jam, sea salt, and some tasty buttery bread. \u00a0I think this is the best thing at L&E and it stays on the menu for good reason. \u00a0It's fantastic.PROBABLY, but they're big, entrees : Wild Boar Sloppy Joe: includes a big pepper, crispy onions, and it's the best sloppy joe you'll have. \u00a0The only reason I say maybe is because it's an entree and maybe you feel like eating a ton of small plates instead. \u00a0But it's very, very good.Burger: also very very good. \u00a0And reasonably sized!Fish dish: I'm usually leery of fish in places that do meat well, but our marlin last night with oxtail ravioli and szechuan style beans was perfect. \u00a0Think about getting this:Foie gras dish: it's always foie gras, nicely seared, with an interesting seasonal plating. \u00a0Last night had pickled rhubarb and some kind of foam and was fantastic. \u00a0Another time was a chocolate whoopie pie, not as good. \u00a0That was in the 20%. \u00a0Crab dish: a salad, with bright citrusy notes and interesting foliage. \u00a0Vegetarian pasta dish: I really liked the fava bean agnoletti. \u00a0The creamy, tender, sweet fava bean filled it.Skip:I don't like the cauliflower lentil appetizer with raita and mango (last time they forgot the mango), but it's very popular because it's always on there. \u00a0I think it's sort of bland and too much of the same thing compared to the other entrees and small plates.Also, the bacon wrapped loin of rabbit with puff pastry. \u00a0I had two servers recommend it, and I had it one time, and it's just not that great. \u00a0The bacon flavor doesn't really complement the light gamy rabbit, and it's just a teensy square of puff pastry.Tete de cochon is a tricky proposition. \u00a0I like pig face meat a LOT, but the one time I had it at L&E the pickles were way too strong to eat with it, even given how meaty and flavorful pig face is. \u00a0Basically, I love L&E, and adore it 80% of the time. \u00a0Enough for a 5 star review to me! \u00a0Oh yeah the bad things about it: the wait is horrific. \u00a0Brunch looked pretty empty at 11:30 on a Saturday (I went to the OSB pop up sausage shop instead), but dinner gets ridiculous. \u00a0But at 8 on a Thursday night I only waited for 40 minutes while sipping deliciousness at the bar. \u00a0At 5 on a Saturday, no wait. \u00a0At 7:30 on a Tuesday for four people, 10 minute wait.", "Date": "2013-05-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kat L.", "ReviewID": "frIOy6V54wMJ7k4AqXKhSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Longman & Eagle is a restaurant that has been raved to be since my first visit to Chicago back in March. \u00a0I finally decided to have dinner on my most recent trip. \u00a0My boyfriend recommended we go on a weekday since the weekend wait can get very long. \u00a0Thursday night at about 7pm, we had to wait 45 minutes. \u00a0The bar was already packed so we went to their back bar. \u00a0Found two seats at the bar and enjoyed some drinks. \u00a0The bartender was able to recommend a nice west coast IPA (I honestly prefer west coast beer over midwest, sorry!). \u00a0After that beer I ventured to their much acclaimed cocktails -- though I am not a cocktail person so my opinion isn't always the best. \u00a0I went with their lemonade (I forget the name). \u00a0It was delicious and not too sweet or too strong. \u00a0Here in Seattle we don't have many hour long waits -- and those waits are usually shorter than quoted, so I got worried when no one came to get us. \u00a0My boyfriend told me they will find us, and sure enough they did!We ended up ordering three small plates and one large plate. \u00a0It left us satisfied but not stuffed, which was perfect for us. \u00a0They gave us delicious complimentary bites as we waited for our first plate. \u00a0 The bone marrow seems very popular so it was our first dish. \u00a0It was very good -- but we both felt a bit barbaric trying to scrape the goodies out of the bone -- and there wasn't much bone marrow. \u00a0I don't think I would want to pay that much for what I got again. \u00a0Since the rest of the menu is rotating I won't go into to much detail about each dish, except they were all amazing. \u00a0All for their dishes come with different parts. \u00a0A dollop of sauce here, a pile of stuff there... make sure to get all components of the dish on one bite!

I don't care. I would have endured longer. I would have endured being held up at gunpoint in the rain had I known what was coming. Squab Pat\u00e9, Giardini\u00e8re, Sourdough Tartines - Solid. Very good start. Simple, but it's supposed to be simple. Herb Crusted Veal Cheek, Braised Celery, Mission Fig, Smoked Fingerling Potatoes, Fonduta di Alba - Flavorful. Great texture to the veal and the fig made an excellent counterpoint. Poor baby cow. It did not die in vain. My wife ordered a salad with crab and something like caviar (it's not on the menu anymore and I was there yesterday), and it was just barely too fishy for me, but other than the one ingredient (was it caviar?), all the flavors connected and it was fresh and complicated (in a good way) when this type of dish is ordinarily not my type of thing at all.

Venison Three WaysRoasted Leg - delicious, sliced into mini-filetsHousemade Sausage - flavorful and freshCalzone - a bit spicy, and really goodMany Garnishes - indeed, and all as great as the venison itselfGreat beer. I had some nice Belgian triples, and they have solid drinks. You know, I didn't even miss my red wine. Screw red wine. This is the 21st Century. I'm going gastropub. And then, while dessert is not my thing . . .Our server recommended Fried Apple Pie, Caramelized Cheddar, Rosemary, Smoked Graham Cracker Ice Cream, Bacon Powder, Spiced Poaching Syrup. Very good. The bacon adds a great flavor and the poaching syrup oozes out of the pie and tastes almost like perfect happiness. I say almost like perfect happiness because perfect happiness is the Charred Olive Oil Doughnut, Bangladeshi Almond Cream, Tanzanian Hot Chocolate, Hazelnut Praline, Aerated Orange. The donuts are fresh and soft, almost gooey. They sit atop a sea of cream, and make sure you dig down a bit to make sure the donuts on top get some cream. Next, you dip the donuts into the chocolate, and this might just be the best dessert I have ever had. Perhaps my North Shore friends would not want to come to Logan Square, step over scraps of street litter, and rub shoulders with hipsters. Perhaps others want white tablecloths and staff so serious and somber that they may as well be presiding over a funeral. Don't care. Good. Stay away then. More for us.

Granted, I had high expectations, but I think a place with a Michelin star should live up to those expectations. Unfortunately, they were utterly disappointing in more way than one. I knew I would have to get there early since the wait is always a long wait. We were planning on eating a late brunch, so I got there around 10:30 am. The woman told me it would be 1.5 hour wait. That's ok, I thought. Because any other place around there would probably be at least an hour wait anyway, for a table of 6. I wait 30 minutes, and my friends show up. We wait some more. We go for a walk and wait some more. I check in with the hostess. It has been 1.5 hours, are we close? Yes, yes, you are next. I can tell you, we were NOT next. We waited OVER 2 HOURS to be seated. It was nearly 1 pm by the time I got to sit down for \"brunch\". I am ok with waiting that long, if I am initially told it will be that long, because then I know what I am getting into. But, in my mind, Michelin star restaurants should not be 45 minutes off in their estimation. After I complained that it had taken much longer than expected to be seated, the waitress tried to appease us by bringing a tiny extra bit of the amuse bouche for us. Then, the food. I got the famous fried chicken and waffles. I was really excited about it and it was . . . ok. It was fine, but nothing fantastic. The real disappointment was my friend who ordered the omelet and crunched into an eggshell. After the first, she tried to solider on, but then, more eggshell. We had to send it back and it took way too long to get the second one. After all of this, they finally felt bad for us and sent shots to the table. Terrible considering that I was driving home after this and had just ordered a beer. Then, they brought a free \"dessert\" which was really just a sweet breakfast item, which ended up being better than anything else anyone ordered (cereal ice cream, yum). \u00a0Needless to say, to top off the day, it took way to long to get our waiter's attention for anything, including the bill.

Seared Striped Marlin: This was served with one huge Oxtail Ravioli, Szechuan Style Beans, and Red Wine Sauce. I am not a huge fan of foam on food, but the oxtail ravioli was really flavorful.

The apps were really good (olives are fantastic) and the tasting flights of whiskey were pretty good as well.The main dishes and \u00a0the desserts were a little meh-- It seemed as though they were too fancy for a whiskey joint and too pedestrian for high brow foodies.Overall it was good- the service was ok, the setting was nice and the apps were great. Worth a try but next time I would keep it simple and stick to the burgers/sandwiches.Final note: A food writer friend of mine told me to wear a plaid shirt when I went there. I laughed and asked why?--he said everyone there would be wearing plaid.

I've gotta say, this place lived up to expectations with a classic brunch menu item they've called the \"PBR Brunch.\" At $8 you get your choice of four long slices of bacon or a side of sausage, two eggs any style, a side of potatoes, and an iced cold PBR ($7 sans-PBR). I ordered the bacon which had a unique and enjoyable smokiness about it. The fried potatoes are serves with scallions which allowed that part of the dish to pick up flavors reminiscent of sour cream and onion chips. The eggs were good, but hey, eggs are eggs. (I also had a taste of my brunchmate's biscuits and gravy, house-made sausage is a win and they nail the biscuit!)The real treat here, however, is L&E's whiskey menu of epic proportions. My cocktail order was a classic old fashioned. It was sweeter and with more ice than most, although the lighter side of this drink was a pleasant pairing at the brunch hour.

We started with: the Lamb Tartare, the Roasted Bone Marrow, Pan Roasted Squab, Seared Foie Gras, \u00a0and the Pan Roasted Nantucket Bay Scallops. We got these items mostly in pairs and it started with the lamb tartare & the roasted bone marrow. The bone marrow was rich, sumptuous, and absolutely lip smacking delicious smeared on just about anything. The lamb tartare was equally as delicious, yet in a completely different, almost mineral way. Fresh, herby and right on point. Next we had the squab & foie gras. I had never eaten squab before, but I was devouring it, eating the meat right off the tiny, tiny leg bone. This baby bird was done perfectly and was seasoned just right. The seared foie gras was also rich and delicious. The searing added to these qualities. We liked these dishes so much, we ordered a second round of them. Lastly, came the scallops, which were cooked well and tasted great. However, against all the other rich, flavor bursting dishes I had just eaten, they kind of paled in comparison.For entrees, we ordered the hangar steak, the pan roasted Arctic Char, the butter poached lobster, and the wild boar sloppy joe. Each item was cooked to perfection. My least favorite was the Arctic Char, but only because I do not prefer that type of fish. I cannot say enough good things about each item.

I've been here numerous times now and have either done brunch or have come here for drinks. This most recent time was coming here for thanksgiving. See, I work wine retail, so most holidays are those rare times where I can easily get time and a half, so I work them as often as possible. What this normally means is that I don't spend thanksgiving with my extended family. \u00a0No, this is far from a pity party for me as I normally spend plenty of time with my family that I consistently want to be around. This time I didn't feel like eating poorly cook and brutally dry turkey that was already getting cold. Nope, my friend used the excuse that his girlfriend was out of town and we decided that thanksgiving would be best served eating somewhere that has a michelin star. I won't go through dish by dish, but this was an utterly wonderful thanksgiving dinner. I knew it was gonna be good when I noticed that robuchon potatoes were the potato dish for the evening. For those that don't know what they are, there is a 1:1 butter:potato ratio. Needless to say you won't be plopping down huge lumps of mashed potatoes. In no shocker, these were knocked out of the park. Perfect texture and utterly awesome. They also did a killer cranberry dish that had either rum or whisky \u00a0in it. I had a hard time not bogarting it from my friend. I should also note that there was foie gras as part of the stuffing. I mean, how the hell can you go wrong with that? While this review is focused on the thanksgiving food, I do want to comment on their brunch. See, I'm all about eggs. I love them. All I can say is that L&E utterly nails their eggs each and every time I've had them. Eggs really are one of those testers for how good a place is. Needless to say, L&E has always passed with flying colors for me. I can't help but comment on the cocktails. I love the originality in them. This is one of the places that I love to come for some cocktails when I'm not in the mood for wine or a lot of beer (contrary to my yelp reviews, this actually isn't every waking moment for me, ha). Granted, I do generally lean towards whisky when I want some spirits, so I would naturally want to come here. But, I love the diversity in how they make their whisky cocktails and the variety of ingredients in them. Even better, the drinks are only $8 per drink. Every single time I come to Longman & Eagle I think to myself: why on earth am I not here more? I've been trying to rectify this lately with more trips, but it seems that I can never come here enough times.", "Date": "2012-11-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jane K.", "ReviewID": "TA1nfs8_iw8e4bHUUHRIrg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I love Longman and Eagle. This is possibly my most frequented restaurant in the city.That being said, I came here for a birthday brunch in mid-April of this year and it was disappointing. I've only come here for dinners (shout out to the meatballs!) so I was also looking forward to coming here for my most favorite meal ever!Perhaps my biggest mistake was not starting my meal off with an old-fashioned... a rookie mistake I must admit.Nevertheless, there were four of us and we each ordered the following dishes:-Fried Chicken and Waffles: delicious but not mind blowing, as L&E tends to do.-Sloppy Joe: have had it before and it's good but a little palate fatiguing so I wouldn't ever order this when there are so many other good choices-Sunnyside Duck Egg Hash: this was surprisingly disappointing. The presentation was beautiful but there wasn't enough duck meat and the hash was blah and underdone and lacking in flavor-Smoked Scottish Salmon Benedict: this was the best dish of the morning! Delicious salmon! Full of flavor and great smoked flavor and nice texture in the mouth. That being said, crab cake or salmon benedict is hardly ever disappointing... So.. my recommendation is try dishes other than the ones we've chosen for brunch or GO FOR DINNER! It's worth the wait.Last night, my boyfriend and I walked over to L&E after dinner at Fat Rice for a drink (Old-fashioned for me of course and a shot of Johnny Drum whiskey for him) and dessert. We had the Pralined Pecan Terrine. It was the right choice! The server got super excited about our choice when we told him our order and he wasn't faking it! The dessert came in 3 parts and each were delicious on their own but the espresso chocolate portion of it was so good that I automatically closed my eyes to savor the slightly gritty texture in my mouth and how it made me sooooo happy. I've had a few other desserts here and they were always great but this one hit it out of the park!The food here is filling and rich and so I don't crave it all the time but I really enjoyed stopping by late midweek (so, no waiting) and enjoying their great beverage and dessert choices.", "Date": "2013-05-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Tiffany L.", "ReviewID": "lm_yU_pz7_MUdS4936oGaA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Saturday: Dinner at L&E.

These three things always add up to a bit of a wait, which was expected, but to the credit of Longman and Eagle, they took down our phone number and called when a table was ready, which allowed us to venture away from the restaurant. The four of us split the whole hog crepinette for an appetizer. Sidenote, ordering main course dishes as appetizers is my new move and I have no idea why I never started doing this earlier. That being said, this dish was the highlight of my meal. Such great flavors. So tender, fell apart easily, was such a great treat. It was complimented nicely by the bed of cheese grits it rested on, which made the egg on top the pillow. Definitely recommend splitting this for an appetizer. I may order this on top of the biscuits and gravy for next time, a request our waitress confirmed with the kitchen as a possibility.While it was overshadowed by the crepinette, the Cuban sandwich I ordered was still very tasty. Cuban sandwiches tend to really get me off, and using pork belly instead of roasted pork, brilliant! Equally important to the meal were the beef fat fries. Great fries as is, but fried in beef fat really sealed the deal. The others in the group got chicken and waffles as well as the wild boar sloppy joe. Both very tasty and fun dishes that I definitely considered ordering myself!Wish I had gotten a bloody, as the sip I had of my friends was great. I ordered a mimosa, which was standard.

I went for brunch and waited about 20 minutes on a Sunday afternoon, a perfect amount of time to enjoy a drink at the bar. Preparing down home classics with a twist, L&E gave me plenty of things to smile about and reason to return.- Salad of Compressed Melon & Fig: Balance was the name of the game here; the melon paired nicely with the ultra-creamy feta and the honey-chili vinaigrette was a brilliant display of restraint when it comes to heat. The pine nuts added a nice flavor, there was a lot going on in this dish and it all ended up harmonizing very well.- Fried Chicken, Waffles & Sweet Potato/Pork Belly Hash: The fried chicken was crunchtastic and seasoned to the max, as any good fried chicken should be. Juicy dark meat that fell off the bone, what more could you ask for? The sweet potato & pork belly hash was nice but felt a bit one-dimensional; I thought it could have used some acidity to pep it up a bit. I was a bit disappointed by the waffle, which was a bit soggy for my taste and didn't really add much to the dish.- Burger: When I first bit into this burger I was blown away by how intense the flavor was, but each additional bite left me feeling like that flavor was simply salt. All of the components were prepared perfectly (including an impeccably medium-rare patty) but the burger was entirely too salty. On the other hand, the accompanying beef fat fries were absolutely delicious and I could drink that spicy mustard on the side.- The cocktails here totally stole the spotlight, all wicked strong but perfectly composed. Each drink highlighted the inherent taste of the alcohol used but removed the bite that a heavy-handed pour can often induce. The Longman Lemonade was a perfect summer drink, the bright acidic lemon playing nicely with the low notes of a sweet bourbon. The Bloody Mary had a depth of flavor I've never experienced, quite possibly the best I've had in the city. And the Root & Rye was true to its description, a perfect take on root beer with a buzzy kick.I think some of the dishes at L&E (or perhaps the dishes I chose) are somewhat conservative conceptually, but the folks in the kitchen and behind the bar definitely know what they're doing.

We're serious coffee drinkers and Chicago is a serious coffee city. For a Michelin star restaurant in the land of Intelligentsia, the coffee should be pretty good, or at least drinkable. As long as I can stir in a bit of milk and sugar, any diner coffee will do. But the coffee here is undrinkable. It's like battery acid. The first sludgy, harrowing drink of their French press made me recoil in terror. HALF OF THE CARAFE WAS FILLED WITH GRINDS. That is not how you brew coffee with a French press. You need only 6 tablespoons for an 8 cup carafe. It took 2 cubes of sugar and whole little pitcher of cream, and it still made the hair on my neck stand up. We took our chance and ordered drip coffee to our room the next day and even that was a horrible, sludgy, face melting toxic waste. Once again, sugar and cream were employed, to no avail.

Their menu items change frequently so something I was able to try may no longer be offered on your visit. Slow Roasted Cauliflower -- Melt-in-your-mouth cauliflower slow roasted to perfection. Lentil, and carmelized onion is what supported the cauliflower while the entire dish was topped with cucumber raita and mango. A lot of different flavors that all came together to give the usually distasteful vegetable a wonderful taste.Wild Boar Sloppy Joe -- The infamous Sloppy Joe everyone boasts about when Longman & Eagle is mentioned. You will see a slew of pictures of this average Joe burger that has been gussied up by Chef Jared Wentworth. Boring ground beef simply isn't good enough around these parts. You're getting wild boar in this sloppy Joe. To top that off, there's also lightly deep-fried onion, pickled jalapeno and crispy sage. Think you're getting regular fries with that? Think not because Chef Wentworth wants you to pair your Wild Boar Sloppy Joe with some fries fried with beef fat. Couldn't really tell the difference with the beef frat fries but there was a new type of flavor that you don't normally taste with fries.Warm Gruyere Donuts -- Deep fried sweet bread shaped into donuts stuffed with hazelnut mascarpone sitting on lightly sweet fig jam and drizzled with honey. The donut bread tasted like it had just popped out of the oven with a sweet aroma that whaffs through your nostrils. It just brings you back and beg for more.Dark Chocolate Crispy Fernet Pave -- Easily the favorite of the night. The dark chocolcate pave was flavored with a hint of fernet. Think elegant chocolate bar with caramel pudding and gelato. Dark chocolate is bitter but when you pair it with caramel and sweet gelato, it complimented each other well.

It was one of the most delicious and inventive meals I've ever had.My boyfriend and I were visiting Chicago for the weekend and wanted to plan a really excellent dinner, and fellow Yelpers suggested this place. The menu looked amazing, but expensive...and we hemmed and hawed about whether or not to go.Boy, did we make the right choice or what!We arrived at about 6:30 and were told there was a 40 minute wait, so we put our names down and strolled down the street for an excellent mojito at Azucar. Upon our return, we still had another 10 minutes or so, so we started looking at the bar menu. I ordered the Florinda (because I'm a big sucker for St. Germain): Blanco Tequila, St. Germain, Creme de Violette, Cocchi Americano, Fresh Lemon, & Sugar, and it was one of the most creative and tantalizing cocktails I've ever had. The flavors were light and refreshing. My date was thrilled by the $3/shot whiskey deal - over 35 different whiskeys, all for $3! He also tried a whiskey cocktail and proclaimed it excellent.Lest you think we did nothing but drink, let me share our delicious menu. I had the Housemade Ricotta Gnuddi,, with Cider Gel, Baby Fennel, Micro Celery, Toasted Hazelnut, Braised Cippolini Vinaigrette, & Celery Froth. I don't know about you, but I'd never had cider gel OR celery froth, and I was intrigued. The gnuddi themselves were like little fried cheese dumplings, but so light and airy. They were perfectly round and bite sized, and each had a golden crust that yielded with a satisfying crunch to reveal a melty, slightly salted cheesy center. SO TASTY. The dish's accouterments were fascinating, and I especially appreciated the texture contrast of the hazelnuts and braised cippolini.My boyfriend loved his Lamb Tartare with 15 Minute Quail Egg, Black Truffle, Crispy Potatoes, and Black Olive Anchovy Oil. I'm not the biggest tartare fan, so I snacked on the marinated olives we were sharing...a generous \"snack\" portion.Finally, we shared the Pave of Slagel Family Farm Pork Belly, served with Pumpkin Risotto, Apple, Chestnuts, Sage...and... SOY CARAMEL. When I said the meal was inventive, this is the first thing that comes to mind. That caramel glaze was unbelievable and truly complemented the richness of the pork belly and risotto. The risotto! Oh, it was superb. Creamy and just slightly pumpkin-y - if a risotto could be called light, then this one was. It was autumnal and lovely. If I didn't like my dining partner so much, I would have stolen the entire plate of food while he was in the restroom...but even I'm not that cruel. The food, as I hope you can tell by now, was delectable. The service was very good \u00a0- our waitress was friendly and attentive, and brought out little complimentary treats - a beautifully prepared spoonful of butternut squash soup that made me close my eyes and sigh, and after the meal, a bite of dessert (I wish I could remember exactly what it was, but I was in a stupor after that pork belly).Longman & Eagle was expensive, but worth every dollar.

It could be a corner bar that's been there for a hundred years, which is the look L&E seems to be going for. There's nothing old-fashioned about the food, though.The dinner menu breaks down into two types of small plates -- bar snacks and \"plates\" -- then salads, sandwiches, and entrees. We ordered four of the smaller plates, but truth be told, I could make an entire meal of that part of the menu. We got the heirloom tomato salad, welsh rarebit (served with a soft pretzel), olive plate, and foie gras. The foir gras was definitely the standout -- sweet and creamy, served on a biscuit/cracker-like magilla that added a nice crunch. What we did *not* get included sweetbreads, grilled sardines, meatballs with polenta, marrow bones, scallops -- you see my point? Endless wonders for later visits. And since the menu changes with the seasons, even more wonders to come.Meanwhile, we did have: fried soft shell crabs, roasted chicken, braised lamb shoulder, and poached cod. All were delightful.L&E is a gastropub -- though for my money, heavier on the gastro than the pub -- so their alcohol selection is excellent. They lean heavily on the dark liquors, with a full page of bourbons (about a bazillion selections), a good choice of American whiskeys, and nearly a dozen ryes. That's right kids, rye is back! And they have absinthe, aperol, and malort. How can you lose? If I lived in the hood, I could easily see stopping by here for a couple of cockietales and some of those small plates fairly regularly.

For you whiskey lovers, they have an impressive collection of 148 selections. You can also appreciate their other unique offerings, which include unusual spirits and biodynamic, small batch wines.While the guy sitting next to me was enjoying a juicy bacon cheeseburger with a side of beef fat fries (be still my clogged heart) tempted me to order the same, the two of us petite girls decided to order 3 dishes to share: chanterelle agnolotti, pork belly confit and slow roasted cauliflower. We attempted to order a side of beef fat fries, but sadly, they cannot do sides of it. I was sort of crushed by that. Luckily, all 3 dishes were amazing, so it made up for the lack of beef fat fries. If you're a vegetarian, I'd highly recommend the cauliflower, as it is an entree portion. There's a uber hipster vibe going on here - you can even book a room upstairs in their Ace Hotel-like digs.

Mama likes. Pretty much my idyllic dining out experience. Longman & Eagle knows how to make a memorable impression, that's for sure... while certainly not for the unadventurous or conservative, the incorporation of daring dishes, bold cocktails and vivacious ambiance all rolled into a bit of an obscure locale, makes this spot purely perfect for a foodie voyager such as m'self. The moment you walk in you just know you're somewhere electric and special. From the intoxicating, manly aroma of smoky pork and plank wood that hits your nose immediately, to the great eclectic mix of clientele chatting away from dimly lit tables or the bygone era grand bar, the atmosphere is positively out of the ordinary with a hint of Louisiana 40's glamour (if such a thing exists). Channel the old-timey music, sip a handcrafted L&E Manhattan and prepare to feel entirely transported... \"am I even still in Chicago?\". My thoughts precisely. Aside from delightful house cocktails, Longman boasts a list of Whiskey, Bourbon, Rye and Beer no short of a mile. Whet your whistle on an Dogfish Head 90 min IPA while you scan the exceptional and innovative menu - and inadvertently drool a la Pavlov's Dog - it's unavoidable as everything just sounds downright divine, and lucky for you, actually is! There's no shortage of meat, meat and more meat and, of course, pork specifically. Vegetarians seriously need not apply... this is a veritable protein jamboree and the ensuing decimation serves to obscenely offend. Sorry. Dig into tender Kobe meatballs atop soft, creamy polenta and cheesy fonduta or a yummy Brandade with calorific beef fat fried chips for starters. On the lighter side (sorta) the Roasted Beet Salad with tangy goat cheese, peppery arugula and a warm, bacon vinaigrette also makes for a phenomenal first course. Plates of amazingly silky Sweetbreads and the slow-braised caramelized Veal Breast with accompanying beef cheek manicotti (ZOMG!) were lovingly (and greedily, natch) devoured between oohs, ahhs, moans and sporadic orgasms. Nothing, however, compared to the incomparable Pork Belly Confit entree with pumpkin risotto, chestnuts and an apple-caramel broth. Holy Shite! Best.Dish.Ever. Indulgent, rich, satisfying and unlike anything salty, sweet, savory, perfect you've ever had before, it comes with my highest recommendations and then some. Should that not be sufficient - oh you glutton, you - go for the illustrious finish and sink your teeth into the warm Callebaut Chocolate-Banana Bread Pudding with Bourbon Anglaise. Almost with a brownie-like quality, it's the dessert of desserts guaranteed not to disillusion or disappoint. Bravo Chef Wentworth!

true gastropub--a casual atmosphere and delicious as well as reasonably priced pub food (bold flavors and high quality ingredients cooked with skill)***Having visited a fair number of gastropubs or places that were gastropub-esque, I would say that Longman & Eagle tops them all. \u00a0Like other good gastropubs, Longman & Eagle features a wide selection of drinks as well as refined pub food with big and bold flavors. \u00a0What separates Longman & Eagle though is how their food showcases both strong technique in the kitchen as well as high quality ingredients (you are fortunate to get one of these qualities in a gastropub let alone both).Their porcini agnolotti was a great reflection of this. \u00a0The pasta had a nice and thin skin while the mushroom filling was earthy and flavorful. \u00a0The pasta here was more satisfying than pasta I had at some of Chicago's fine dining spots. \u00a0The ravioli dish at Ria lacked a great filling--not flavorful enough--while Alinea's pasta had strong flavors yet the pasta was too thick.The garnishes for the agnolotti were great. \u00a0The sauce was a creamy sweet corn sauce (a great showcase for one of the Midwest's best local ingredients) as well as a big helping of grana padano cheese. \u00a0While there was a big portion of cheese, the grana padano was softer, creamier and less sharp than your typical parmesan so it provided a nice compliment to the pasta without being overpowering.There were also some crispy skin pieces, which were thicker than your standard crispy skin garnish you will see elsewhere. \u00a0The crispy skin here was bold and hearty and had similarities to chicharrones.Their porchetta (an entree) was another great reflection of their refined pub fare. \u00a0The porchetta was incredibly juicy and tender (also a good flavor). \u00a0It was topped with crispy thick cut bacon. \u00a0The porchetta was paired with a creamy and satisfying corn risotto as well as a peach relish that provided a good sweet note to the salty bacon.Their pastrami-cured sweetbreads were also good. \u00a0They used a thick cut of sweetbread and they didn't bread it too much, which was a good thing. \u00a0The sweetbread was slightly crispy on the outside with a juicy and flavorful center. \u00a0The sweetbread was accompanied by a gruyere cream, thousand island dressing and sauerkraut (kind of like a reuben). \u00a0All the sides were good and flavorful though they did not stand out as much as the sweetbread.The only other food/savory item I had was their tuna salad amuse bouche and it was just okay.I have been to a lot of gastropubs where desserts are really throwaway dishes. \u00a0They might carry 3 or 4 items, but they are often standard stuff. \u00a0That was not the case at Longman & Eagle. \u00a0The desserts were creative and the final presentations showcased that desserts are taken seriously here (both in terms of ingredients and execution). \u00a0And while I was not a big fan of the desserts I had, I could tell that this kitchen might have what it takes to put out a truly great dessert.Their gruyere donuts were too savory. \u00a0They were crispy fritters that were filled with a heavy portion of melted gruyere cheese (they kind of reminded me of the risotto balls at Little Dom's). \u00a0The accompaniments were savory too like a whipped goat cheese cream and grated parmesan. \u00a0There were some sweet elements (like maple syrup), but the dish still had an appetizer feel to it. \u00a0This was a less sweet version of Lazy Ox Canteen's honey ricotta fritters (and those are starters at that restaurant).The olive oil pound cake was better. \u00a0The cake was quite dense, which was okay, but I wish the flavor was more pronounced and satisfying. \u00a0The garnishes were good though. \u00a0There were some good cherries as well as a nice sour cherry jelly. \u00a0There was a generous serving of thick, dense and lightly sweet buttermilk saffron ice cream.Service was very good here. \u00a0The staff was friendly and efficient. \u00a0Food came out at a good pace.Prices were good as well. \u00a0A lot of their entrees were in the low $20s or less. \u00a0Their drinks were also reasonable with most of their mixed drinks topping out at $8. \u00a0Longman & Eagles specializes in a large selection of whiskey, bourbon and rye (in shot form or via a mixed drink).The outside of Longman & Eagle is not much to look at (neither is the surrounding area). \u00a0The inside is comfortable though. \u00a0It is not contemporary and upscale like Culver City Father's Office. \u00a0Instead, it has a more lived-in feel (brick walls, mismatched chairs, unvarnished wood ceiling), which seems to go well with the neighborhood, the staff and the hearty food (which is excellent but also rustic and not needlessly showy).Longman & Eagle was one of my best dining experiences in Chicago and with their combination of great food, personable service and good value, I think it is one that many would enjoy.Free parking is available on the street.", "Date": "2011-08-23", "Author_Location": "Playa del Rey, CA"}, {"Author": "Michael F.", "ReviewID": "bmb8C-SIsGdXOLW5wLs7xQ",

There are other aptly named whiskeys on that list such as Rebel Yell, Virginia Lightning, Fighting Cock, and Georgia Moon. The last whiskey mentioned comes in a mason jar and tastes like lighter fluid. More popular brands such as Maker's Mark, Jack Daniels, and Jim Beam are also on the $3 list along with many more that are at various prices. If you brought about $60 here, you could kill yourself.

Noises of friends and couples bounced all over the room, lending itself to louder voices, but nothing obtrusive. The smiling hostess greeted our brave warriors of eating with a 30 to 45 minute wait, begrudgingly, not as bad as what was thought, they proceeded to make their mark and wait at the bar. Here they spy a fine list of drinks, a size able beer list, various in location and styles. Wines that satisfied and lightened a heavy mood. A nod to a server and a beer and glass of wine was placed. Then. Out of no where. Their prescribed time was cut to, \"If you could close out your tab we will have a seat ready for you in a few moments.\" Sweet. Super sweet. Our fine duo headed over to the table and poured over their options. The pressure had begun. With what little room that was left in their stomachs, what would satisfy yet not overfill their gastronomic tendencies? Meatballs. You can rarely ever go wrong with balls of meat in polenta and fonduta. Although small, they pack a big punch of flavor. Beware, they should have a label warning of their crackiosity. (Yeah I said it. They are that good.) To follow that up, two light salads were ordered, a shaved pear with generous chunks of stilton and green beans. A slight nod to naughtiness yet filled with light and fresh fruit to make you feel ever so healthy. (Those tricky tricky bastards.) The other, a brand new asparagus salad with a softly cooked egg, that when the tenderest touch hits the delicate casing out came the oozing and delicious center. Aromas of truffle wafted over. (Damn.) Our virtuous twosome, slightly woozy from these first hits of fantastic feastdom, they only got their bearings straight long enough to be dealt with another well timed hit. Scallops and braised oxtail. Well seared and deeply colored scallops sitting on a bed of melt in your mouth braised tail surrounded by delicate gnocchi and topped off again with a fontina fonduta. The sauce got overplayed by the well seasoned tail, but all in all it was a sumptuous dish. Libations were well needed as the final and heavy blow came thundering down on the wavering duo. A selection of some fine artisanal cheese for dessert. Soft and room temperature, served simply with a little reduced fruit and toasted bread.

Sparring was not needed with the staff, for they served every moment well attended with a smile and gracious attitude. The bill was the ultimate knockout, well with in reason price.

We'd been meaning to try for awhile (clearly, word is out on the streets that this is THE PLACE to be), and finally had an excuse.We went relatively early on a Thursday evening and had no wait for a lovely table outside on their patio. Good news for us, because we were hungry!A round of cocktails set us off to peruse the menu. I went with the Dark and Stormy, which was delightfully gingery, as it should be. We started with the meatballs and polenta \u00a0(YUM) and the pretzel with the welsh rarebit (DOUBLE YUM). In lieu of both ordering entrees and our desire to maximize our menu experience, we went with two small plates and an entree. We did the gulf shrimp and grits (my least favorite...edible, but just not as appetizing as I imagined it) and the sweetbreads (served smoked pastrami style a la Reuben, it was stellar). For our entree, we split the hangar steak with the bone marrow ravioli. Cooker perfectly with fresh elotes and green beans underneath, it was a beautiful dish (both to observe and to eat).Of course, being as it was a special occasion, we had to get dessert (and another cocktail...Persian Sunrise for me!). We went with the Gruyere donuts. Another stunning win. It was a more savory dish, but the cheesy donuts and the accompanying whipped goat cheese was wonderful. Rich and savory, it rounded out the meal to perfection.The service deserves its own mention. Not only was our server knowledgeable about the menu (and how many dishes we wanted to order), he was friendly, accommodating, and just plain nice. Dirty plates were whisked away in short order, waters never stayed empty, and cocktails were replenished in short order.

From decor to food, they take some classic combinations and dressed them up in unconventional ways to reinvent color and flavor profiles.After an afternoon of dress alterations, my fellow bridesmaid and I decided to celebrate that we still fit into our gowns by pigging out here. My life is all about making bad decisions.First up was an amuse bouche of tuna tartare with compressed peach and pickled daikon. As raw fish comprises ~50% of my diet (the other half being cheese), I've had a fair share of tartares, and the peach and radish were a radically different take on adding acid/lightness/sugar to the fish. I liked it. A lot.We split quite a few small plates. The foie gras ($15) came out first, and it was beautifully smooth. With sweet fig and a blueberry gastrique, the kitchen really added their own twist to the traditional torchon with brioche. The next dish, seared scallops with corn and fava beans ($12) was also a hit. I love English peas; the puree was subtle and a delicious complement to the perfectly cooked seafood. Finally, we shared the hiramasa tartare, which had compressed mango, cucumber and an avocado puree ($14). After eating the first tuna tartare amuse, I was a little curious to see how a small plate of yellowtail (hamachi) tartare would compare. Both fish were delicious, but the avocado puree on this plate rounded out and elevated the dish.For my entree I had the pork belly ($19). They sold me with the corn-bacon risotto and chanterelles. This plate was much darker and earthier than our appetizers. I wasn't prepared for it - it was an explosion of fall/late summer flavors, and the black garlic emulsion in particular added a serious bitterness to the dish. Finally, though we were groaning with satiety, we *had* to peek at the dessert menu. Of course, we also *had* to split a gianduja creme brulee ($8) - chocolatey, hazelnutty and creamy. Executed with perfect technique - what's not to like?Service was great and the atmosphere was awesome. We breathed a breath of relief upon arriving sans reservation around 6 pm.

Let's start piling on the troubles, shall we?We called ahead, heard that the wait was about 25-30 minutes, so decided to brave the blizzard hitting Chicago to make it over there in time. When we arrived, I got the cold shoulder from the hostess who, while I saw her offer coat check and menus to people ahead of and behind me, pretty much ignored me except to tell me that I had to re-check in when my fiance, who was parking the car, got there. We did as she said, and were promised a 30 minute wait time. Over an hour later, we still weren't seated. Oh yeah, did I mention this was a MONDAY? I don't care if it takes an hour to seat us, just tell me upfront. We did get an update from the hostess after an hour, telling us it would be a \"LITTLE longer\". Oh, longer than the extra 30 minutes you just said? Okay. We waited some more in the packed, jostling bar area until we were called for our table, which was directly in front of the door with freezing snow and cold blowing in every 3 minutes or so, and a crazy cold draft coming from the window. We were also ATTACHED to the hostess stand. After trying out both sides of the table, we asked the hostess if it was possible for us to wait a bit longer and get another table. I can't really fathom it or believe it, but the blonde hostess said \"No.\"I was really sad and starting to feel like this might have \"worst birthday ever\" written all over it, but tried to remain optimistic. So what if I had to wear my Columbia ski coat through dinner, right?That was until our server stopped by and decided that even though we'd had to wait 3 times as long as we'd been told, and even though we were seated at the WORST POSSIBLE TABLE in the restaurant, AND it was my birthday, she didn't have to smile or pretend to be interested in us at all. While we were ordering (after no hello, have you been here before, recommendations, or general politeness... more of a clipped, \"are you guys ready?\"), after my fiance had ordered the bulk of the meal, I threw in that I wanted to also try the welsh rarebit. She stared at me blankly before sniping, \"What, like as your entree?\" Me: \"What?\" Her: \"You want PRETZELS as your entree?\" Me: \"Um no, as an appetizer.\" Fiance: \"We're going to share the chicken entree.\"Her: \"Oh, okay.\" (And then brushing us off and walking away rudely.)At this point, I was so disappointed in the entire experience that my eyes filled with tears (yes, they made me CRY on my birthday), and my fiance suggested we just leave.So, we did. Restaurants take reservations for a reason, and that reason is for the benefit of the customer. Perhaps making the back portion of the place for reservations and keeping the front for walk-ins, they could accommodate everyone while keeping the \"hipster vibe\" they seem to be going for. Or, if you make a patron wait 3 times as long as they were promised, ask if they'd like a drink on the house, or at least recognize your mistake and make sure they end up at a decent table. I won't be returning unless they open up to the idea of reservations, and even then, I'll have my own reservations about trying this place again.**Update: Bruce, the owner, immediately responded to my review with an apologetic message.

Eager to try it out, my girlfriend and I headed over to Logan Square on a gray, windy, and rainy Saturday afternoon for lunch.Arriving, the one thing we immediately noticed was that there was no host to be seen. We stood waiting by the door for several minutes, catching stares from other diners in the cozy front dinging room/bar area. We were finally seated and handed the brunch menu, which is basically just breakfast and lunch menus.We put our order in with our waitress--obviously I went with the burger, medium, while my girlfriend opted for the BLT with fried egg--and then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Diners at tables on both sides of us had been seated and ordered in the time after we had placed our orders. After about 20 minutes, out waitress returned to confirm I had indeed ordered fries with my burger. That was a pretty clear indication she had never put our order in. I can understand if a server is frazzled and made an honest mistake, but it was Saturday around 12--not too crowded, and instead of copping to her mistake and apologizing, letting us know where our food is, she basically lied to us.So we wait another 20 minutes.

Maybe it's normal there for brunch but I come from the land of Lakeview where all the good brunch places have a half hour wait minimum. At L&E we were seated right away which made my growling tummy VERY happy.

The apples on top were spiced well and the honey cr\u00e8me fraiche that came with it gave it a nice sweet and soured bite. The bourbon maple syrup was delicious and it was just the right amount (a little coated on the plate, rather than drowning the whole dish). My biggest complaint were my sausages--they were cold and not really that interesting flavorwise. If I had realized that the side of those was going to set me back $5 I would have sent them back and asked for them to be reheated but ah well. The servers were on the ball and kept our water glasses and coffee cups full which is a plus. My friend got the eggs Benedict I had been itching for and she was a fan. I took a bite and the heirloom tomatoes were a nice touch but they weren't the best eggs Benedict I've ever had (although not the worst).Perhaps I went into the brunch with my expectations a bit too high after the awesome Baconfest dish I had and the excellent scores I've seen on here.

Go early, my friends, they don't take reservations.We were seated in the front room by the great old bar with the bottles of whiskey stacked tall. There is also a back room with additional tables. Check out the vintage jukebox. No need for any coinage- it plays for FREE! and is chock full of interesting choices! The decor is simple, with wooden tables and chairs and old light fixtures that looked like they were plucked from a barn. We ordered our favorite beers from an endless list and began to look at the menu. Meat is king here, and pork rules so if you are one who shudders at the thought of meat, this may not be your place (although there is a beet salad on the menu that looked quite good) The bar plates and small plates are sharable so that is what we did. Our server, Sarah, was terrific, and quick to point our her favorites on the menu and from the specials of the day. We figured we couldn't go wrong with her suggestions so everything we ordered had the \"Sarah stamp of approval\"! We started with the duck rillette and Kobe meatballs served over cheesy polenta. The rillette was a bit salty for me but delicious smeared over the buttered toast slices that come with it. The meatballs were a tasty combination of flavors. For small plates, the braised oxtail and scallop dish was an amazing flavor and texture combination. We also went with the \"pigs cheeks\" special of the day which were rolled, crumbed and lightly fried. Tasted like bacon . . .and there is never anything wrong with that! Continuing on our \"Bounty of Pork\" evening- we ordered the pork belly as an entree to split. Woo-wee! This Pork Belly came with pumpkin risotto, chestnuts and an apple-caramel broth.

It hit the spot on such a cold December evening. It's your typical hot toddy but with Makers Mark, Apple Jack Brandy. The unique part was the Yuzu, Japanese citrus fruit...much like they told me, a Meyer Lemon. This cocktail could warm even the Grinch's cold little heart. I also got the Rye Not? flight later on in the meal. I really enjoyed the Old Overholdt Rye, the R1 was far too abrasive for me and the Whistle Pig 10yr was decent but nothing to write home about. To start: Buffalo Sweetbreads : this app was delicious but only truly impressive knowing that it was made from sweetbreads and not from your average chicken wing. It didn't taste bad, but they didn't taste like any new ground was being broken. They were forgettable aside from the fluffy pillow of ranch that accompanied them. The lightness of the ranch dip made for an interesting twist on a classic.Pig face with Sauerkraut Gnocchi and what tasted like a more sophisticated take on a thousand island dressing. This was by FAR the star of the night. It was as if someone took all the great flavors out of a Reuben Sandwich and made it into a 5 star fancy pants dish. My friends and I all fought over the last bite of this one. Don't let the name scare you. The Gnocchi with sauerkraut sounded awful to me but was very subtle and was the perfect bite with the pig meat & thousand island reinvented sauce. Entree: Wild Boar Sloppy Joe & Beef Fat Fries. I don't know what made this so disappointing, but it was. The bun was just far too big for the wild boar and made it hard to fully taste the meat...and well that's just not OK when it comes to sloppy joes! The fries were really crispy and tasty but had a bit too much salt and the sheer portion of fries was just madness. It was a mountain on my plate! I wouldn't order this again. Other friends of mine all ordered more sophisticated entrees and I had some serious dish envy. The Venison being the one I wish I had ordered. It was cooked perfectly with not the least bit of gameyness to it. For Dessert: Peppered Shortbread cookie with Bacon ice cream, a baked apple & buttered popcorn mousse. This dessert tasted good all in one bite, not too heavy on the bacon ice cream unless you really enjoy a smoked flavor. The bacon ice cream's smoked flavor overpowered the other flavors quickly so I added it to bites sparingly. I could have even scrapped the shortbread and just eaten the butter popcorn mousse and the baked apple together. The butter popcorn mousse was the most surprising hit of the whole dessert dish. It had this wonderfully light consistency but then that slight after taste of popcorn. Wonderful. I smiled with every bite. That's how I know I'm hooked. Overall, a great place to dine.

While it wasn't my favorite drink that night, there was a gimlet-ish drink with an interesting mix of Tanq, lime, and chartreuse that is worth a look (thanks Molly O for the heads up). Felt more like a summer drink than the arctic Chicago evening we were out in, but a good drink is still a good drink. Someone also tried the Manhattan and the hot toddy with yuzu... that one may become a new cold remedy.I think somewhere in the evening we sat down and ate dinner. I couldn't pass up the pork belly and pumpkin risotto; pretty good, but fair warning that its as heavy as it sounds - twas a bit fatty, even for pork belly. Bring an appetite. For me the buzz was worth it. Its not original, or some crazy new place - it does a few important things really well. High marks for value - great food at a competitive price versus other similar places.

I was so looking forward to the yellow of the egg bursting under my first bite, but no-- it was WAY overcooked.

She acted as if it was normal to wait over an hour for a cheeseburger and BLT and never checked on us.

Reserving a room was easy - we stayed in Room #4. After a bit of a slow check-in (heavily contributed to some credit card confusion on our part!) I was ready to get upstairs and put our bags down. The room has two huge windows, overlooking the patio. The bed is comfortable, and the bath/vanity area is GORGEOUS. I loved the simple but modern decor and the cute little touches, like the tape player and mix tapes in lieu of a TV and DVD player. While I was absent-mindedly reviewing the room, he popped the question \u00a0:)We went downstairs to celebrate and were greeted very happily by the hosts and managers. They gave us champagne and a shot to toast our new Facebook relationship status (ha). The bar was hopping and we split a DELICIOUS pretzel with Welsh rarebit sauce to try to dry up all the celebration booze. It helped (a little.) The room is right above the bar, so for anyone planning to spend the evening overnight, keep this in mind. Hopefully if you've done it right you won't even notice, and the noise does quiet down before 2 am.The next day we enjoyed brunch. I had an excellent (and very necessary) bloody mary, while my fianc\u00e9e had a warm drink made with yuzu. He said it was very very good. He got biscuits and gravy, which are some of the best I've had, and I had a very good and light omelet made with ramps, morels, and English peas. Everything tasted delicious.

They went on and on about how it was the coolest thing ever and how big of a loser you were for not having done it yet? Fast forward to your first bio class and you've finally bitten the bullet and torn that little froggy apart, and it was.... mehhhhh. Not so cool. That's how L&E felt to me.Service was totally on par- from the host/hostess to the bartender and mixologist and our server, everyone was super friendly, super professional, and super hipster. But that's okay, as long as the hipster in them isn't judging the preppy in me, we're cool. Our cocktails were truly fantastic. I had everything tequila-related, the mister had all things whiskey. Your mixologist or server will guide you through the menu if you want to avoid certain styles of drinks. I certainly had to employ their guidance as I will fling my drink into outerspace if it's even slightly sweet. Sweet is for dessert and children, not alcohol. Grown-ups should drink their alcohol as such. On to the food- choosing from bar snacks, small plates and an entree--buffalo sweetbreads: my favorite of the meal. Sweetbreads are tasty little nugget treats. But doused in buffalo sauced and served alongside a mouse of garlicky ranch? Heaven, my darling. -pretzel and welsh rarebit sauce: hell-O salt. I get it. It's a pretzel. It needs salt. But \u00a0caked on so thick the pretzel flavor was lost? Even the sauce was salty. And salty sauce... I can't go there. You know where it was going, but I can't.-quail and foie gras-infused cornbread: the mister enjoyed this one a lot. I can't get past the flavor of the foie, but the quail was quite tender-beer-battered softshell crab and accouterments: as I am NOT a food critic, only a lover of crabs, I can say that the crab batter reminded me of Long John Silvers. Yeah, I went there, but it was bad. Super salty batter with a weird LJS flavor. I would have preferred Red Lobster to this.-Burger: in hindsight we probably should have had something more adventurous, but when the mood for a burger strikes, well it's a hard one to suppress. The burger was cooked well, the bacon was fresh and very flavorful, but there was the damned salt again! What is it with L&E and flinging salt onto everything they create?The concept behind L&E's food is really superb, modern and forward. Unfortunately the salt-factor ruined most of the food for me.Sidebar: I suggest going after the sun has set. That place was not meant to be seen in daylight.

Not so much. \u00a0The kobe is lost with the accoutrements, though. \u00a0I loved how the meat tasted in the one meatball that wasn't emerged in the parsley, oil, cheese mix-up. \u00a0It wasn't for me, but I certainly admire the effort. \u00a0The flavors were all there, they just didn't seem to work together. Preference, no. Taste? Unbelievably yes. Find a simpler delivery method for the meatball and I'll order it again. Or, I'll just ask for them plain. \u00a0The price on the three meatballs \u00a0I got was pretty cheap.As for the place itself, it looks fantastic. \u00a0 The bar stools are backless with coat hooks underneath the bar. \u00a0That's pretty smart thinking, considering that the train station is across the street and a lot of the walk in traffic is going to be lugging big ugly coats around all winter. \u00a0They're very handsome bar stools, too. \u00a0There is wood is \u00a0on the ceiling, which looks great and the lines of the tables and the environment work together very well. \u00a0There are two rooms, and even though the back room doesn't flow from the front room, it still works. \u00a0It is a bar, though, and the bathroom doors are conspicuous. \u00a0I'm almost certainly coming back, probably very soon. \u00a0Hopefully on a Friday night when I sample a few more of the beverages. \u00a0Job well done, Longman.

Longman & Eagle's pate is seriously the best I've ever had. It's the kind of pate that you dream about for months on end until you get your next fix. For dinner, I had grilled venison with huckleberries, sweet potato gnocchi, and something else extraordinary. I'm not a clean plate club member, but on our Valentine's Day I was.

The first time I came, we only waited 27 minutes despite the quoted wait at 1-1.5 hours. Not that I was keeping track or anything. The next time we did legitimately wait 1.5 hours.So I've spent some time sitting at the bar. It's not the worst place to be, especially because I truly love and appreciate whiskey (forewarning, this part is going to be me just gushing about whiskey). The bartenders are really cool, and one of them remembered me from my first visit. Whiskey flights. Awesome. I considered getting the white flight, because I love Koval (100% one grain and really only use the hearts from distillation). However I got the single barrel bourbon flight, and it was great. Along with the ridiculous whiskey list and $3 shots, L&E is heaven. In terms of cocktails I've had the January V (Hirsch Special Corn Whiskey, Fernet Menta, Yellow Chartreuse, Angostura Bitters, Acid Phosphate) and the Chicagoan (Punt E Mes, Wild Turkey Rye, Cynar, Malort, Salt, Angostura). Both were fucking awesome.Also FOOD. Pastrami spiced pig head, farm greens salad, rabbit pot pie, roasted half chicken, zabuton of beef (best name for a cut of meat, ever?), roasted marrow bones, duck meatloaf, rhubarb and asparagus salad. Hot damn. The pig head and meatloaf were probably my favorite of the lot. The rabbit pot pie comes with \"vegetables rabbits like to eat.\" \u00a0The marrow was a lot more delicate than I'm used to, since the bones are cut across rather than lengthwise. On one visit with friends, one person got just the pretzel, while another got the meatballs, both of which are bar snack sized.

He was not terribly helpful with ordering. When we tried to start by ordering appetizers, but he told us that they don't let people do that there? Very odd, and that is fine if that is how you run your kitchen, but tell us that when you give us the menus rather than when we are ready to order apps. He also seemed to only be able to serve one table at a time. Meaning he would check on one table go back do whatever they needed and then come back to check on the next table rather than managing his time by going to a bunch.The cocktails were great, but the food was not, and It was way over priced. The bone marrow was gelatinous. The burger was bland and the bun seemed stale. The beef tallow fries had a particularly unctuous texture. The scallops were under done and had the accompanying sauces and veggies did not do much to enhance them or make them unique, and the portion small.... A lot of the entrees seemed to focus on textures that I could do without. Fried soft shell crab? Ewwww no thanks! \u00a0There are tons of great places to eat in Chicago, and Longman & Eagle is okay, but not 20+ dollars a plate for an entree good. Go to Revolution, Province, Brown Trout, Sepia, The Girl and the Goat or about a dozen other restaurants in the city and get a better meal! Sure, those places may not all have the same trendy factor (although a few of them do), but at least you will get what you pay for and it will undoubtedly be better than Longman & Eagle!", "Date": "2012-08-04", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Penny S.", "ReviewID": "GmTGmQbWBsumbig4sTeFNg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't wanna like it. Our precious, barely-tapped Logan Square is changing so much lately. But this is change I can get behind, woo!

I was so happy to see they kept the bar but everything else is unrecognizable. We bellied up and scanned the menu.

Heeding my internal voice which reminds me that my eyes are always bigger than my stomach, I decided to save the larger entrees for another day. One beet salad, one pear salad, the kobe meatballs with polenta and one duck rillette later, all our food arrived at once - something that normally makes me completely insane - but to be fair, we didn't stagger the order and she didn't ask if we wanted to. Shrug. We dove in and agreed, everything was right on the money. The beet salad portion was perfect. In fact, ordering that in addition to an entree would actually probably be just a little too much food. My rillette was smooth and the right amount in proportion to the toasts, and the cornichons were exactly the acid note it needed, as well as the grainy brown mustard. How rillette can be delicate I don't know, but they've done it.Kobe meatballs...holy crap... every restaurant has its own \"holy crap\" item (Avec's dates, Publican's pork belly, Big Star's al pastor, Custom House's sweetbreads, etc) and those meatballs are theirs. It works in complete harmony, the polenta, the parsely pesto and the fonduta. Seriously L&E, leave them on the menu.

If I ever decide to go back, I will definitely let you all know how it is. Even you, Drea C. Original review below...**We did everything right. We knew attempting to go to a new, neighborhood gastropub on the Saturday night of its opening week would come along with a wait. So we called ahead and they assured us it haven't been more than a 45 minutes wait so far. I also found a blog with a review stating that they'll take your phone number and call you when your table is ready anyway...perfect. Our party of 4 arrived around 8pm and was told we had an hour wait, gave them our phone number and went two doors down to El Cid Tacos for a drink.Two margaritas too many we realized it had been about 1.5 hours with no call, so we closed our tab and walked over there thinking our table had to be within a drink away.We checked back in at Longman & Eagle and were told that we were the next 4 top to be seated as soon as two 2 tops could be squeezed together. We crammed in and ordered another drink from their bar where we waited 30 MORE minutes (2 hours at this point) until we saw a beacon of hope... a 4 top was paying their bill! We cashed out with our cocktail waitress, hovered over the table while it was cleaned and what did the hostess do at this point? SEAT ANOTHER PARTY OF 4 INSTEAD. Right in front of our face! I tapped her shoulder in disbelief and said, \"You showed me the list and told us we were the next 4-top, we have been waiting over 2 hours, when you said it would be one, I think you are mistaken and this is our table.\" She swiftly said, \"Nope they are first\" and walked back to her station.At this point we each set our almost finished drinks at the hostess station and left. It didn't seem like they minded if they lost our business or not, but this will go down as the worst restaurant at which I've never ate.In the end, their lack of regard or apology for their oversight was what was most alarming when they are trying to make nice in the new neighborhood. Other reviewers that were lucky enough to get a seat seemed to like it, but to me this place was just complete snobbery in a flannel facade.FYI: I'm a carnivore, but to my vegetarian friends out there, from staring at their menu during our long wait I noticed that even their meat-free (fries) and seafood options state that they are cooked in animal fats or plated with meat as well.

I'm moving to DC, which is a fun city but has a relatively less impressive dining scene in comparison to Chicago, which I will definitely miss. As a last fine-dining harrah, I chose for us to go to Longman & Eagle, a one Michelin star rated gastropub in Logan Square. We had a group of 5 and wanted to eat on a Saturday night without the requisite two hour wait, which are difficult requirements to fulfill. We managed to arrive at 5:30 and were immediately seated, although the restaurant definitely filled quickly soon afterwards. We all started with drinks. I asked for a recommendation for something that is refreshing but not too sweet. I can't remember the name of my drink, but I received a delicious citrusy cocktail that was exactly what I had hoped for and more. My friends each ordered a drink as well and let me try theirs, but I liked mine the most at my table.The small plates were the highlight of our meal. We had some sort of fish with quail egg (I'm terrible at remembering names of dishes, and the online menu isn't updated). The fish was perfectly cooked and went so well with the melty egg. We also got the order of softshell crab, which is breaded and deep friend, but didn't taste at all heavy. The components just went together so well, and it is among one of my favorite recent dishes. There was a consensus that the meal went downhill from there however. I ordered the sweet corn risotto off the vegetarian menu since I didn't feel like having too much meat that day. It was very average and my friends said that I kind of asked for it by ordering from the vegetarian menu, but at the same time, I've been to other restaurants for vegetarian dishes that were stellar. This just didn't feel like it had anything interesting going on. One of my friends ordered the pig's head, which has a huge slab of pork sitting on a bed of risotto, and her risotto portion tasted much better than my dish for some odd reason. Other main dishes ordered at our table were the burger (decent burger but a burger nonetheless), scallops (also pretty good), and the house special of the day, which was coca-cola braised brisket. My friend ordered it on recommendation of the waiter, but this was the worst received by our table. Literally half of each piece of meat was fat, and the other half was still fatty to the point of almost slimy. The braise was not good and just made the meat taste strange. One friend tried a piece and spit it out because she thought it was disgusting, and my friend who ordered it just sat there, poking it and looking sad for the rest of the night. If I had his dish, my rating would've been lower.The meal went uphill again for dessert. We shared the cornbread churros (?), which tasted like cream puffs, as well as the trifle. Both were good but not stellar, but the desserts helped end our meal on a more positive note. Overall, I really appreciate the atmosphere of the restaurant. It felt very fun and had an extremely extensive beer selection, plus the service was top notch. However, because of our mediocre main dishes, I'm unable to give this restaurant a higher rating.

Round two consisted of a few more drinks and sweetbreads, I have never had sweetbreads before and now that I have I suggest everyone try these nuggets of rich flavor. \u00a0And finally the dish we had been waiting for... bone marrow topped with an onion salsa. \u00a0We could have just ordered six of these and been happy, the marrow is succulent and I want it in my butter dish at home to slather on toast every day. \u00a0After the marrow, not quite full enough we nibbled on some frogs legs and enjoyed the \u00a0banana toffee and ginger custard, our waiter was right on this one...ahhhhmazing. Both of us were awestruck by the wonderful meal and the service was quick and non-intrusive. \u00a0As a resident of Logan Square I am proud to have L&E in my neighborhood, I still think that garners some kind of reward like no wait seating...hint hint. \u00a0We will be back again for that bone marrow, and sweetbreads, and lobster, the veal heart and the foie gras... we will be back for everything its just that good. p.s. $2 PBR, keep it classy", "Date": "2011-02-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Steve W.", "ReviewID": "34d4MrkfpeM6siUCYTqajA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is stupidly popular despite being out in Logan Square. Went on a Wednesday, and it was absolutely packed to the brim.The atmosphere is what you'd expect - trendy with dark wood and ambient lighting. Bring your flannel or feel out of place.At any rate, the food is good. The shared plates are not for those with cholesterol problems. We're talking pork cheeks, bone marrow - so fat, fat and more fat. Each dish is prepared with care and balance, and it's absolutely worth the hype.Speaking of the pork cheek, you need to get it. If you love balancing savory meat with a hint of sweetness, this is right up your alley. To balance it out, get the beet salad. It's a roasted beet salad - impossible to go wrong. In terms of the donuts, I could frankly take it or leave it. It's as savory as you think, but it's surprisingly not that heavy. The main frustration for a lot of folks is that the wait is epic (3 hours at 5:30 on a Saturday? Jesus). This is sort of exacerbated by the fact that, according to the hostess, they only have two tables that can accomodate more than 4 guests. The space itself is large enough to where you'd think they can fit more large tables - particularly in the back area.Anyways, spring can't come sooner.

After looking at the menu, we decided on 2 apps and an entr\u00e9e each. \u00a0We ordered the pork cheek and the marrow bone with onion jam. Both damn tasty. \u00a0The pork cheek was tender, and the lentils had the right amount of foie gras jus underneath and wasn't overcooked and mushy. \u00a0Marrow bone is one of my favorite indulgences, and they gave you a hefty amount here. Not sure if I just lucked out, but there actually was too much marrow for my toast. SUPER SCORE!! My friend ordered the pork shank for his dish on recommendation from the waitress, and man was it a large chunk of meat. I didn't get a chance to try it, but he said it was delicious and the meat just fell off the bone. \u00a0I had the burger. \u00a0I requested it medium rare and it came out at the perfect temperature. As I started eating it, it was so juicy that I had to wipe my left arm from wrist to elbow twice because of all the juice running down my arm!! (My doggie was my best friend when I got home that night...) \u00a0Yum, highly recommended (by me and my pup)! \u00a0The beef fat fries were just ok though, as they were greasy and heavy tasting.

The Bone Marrow is different than other restaraunts because they provide you with salt and a jelly on the top which makes it a different and yummy experience. The meatballs have an bold but not overpowering herbacious taste with a delicous marinara sauce and sits on top of an amazing bed of polenta. I could honestly eat entire bowel of this and be happy. The olives are a nice compliment to the heavier appetizers and have several different sizes and flavors and are marinated perfectly. They are not overpowering with flavor and are done just right. Big Plates: We split this amazing porchetta dish that just melted in your mouth. The flavor of the meat was buttery and salty and the risotto underneath was perfectly cooked with just the right sized vegetables and creaminess. Mmmmmm We also split the clam in white wine dish (sorry don't have the exact name and the menu online is not up to date). The white wine broth was extremely flavorful. The wine and the herbs everything mixed nicely. What stood out to me the most with this dish though was how perfectly the clams were cooked. They were silky and moist and flavorful.The service: Waitress was perfect hipster friendly and knew exactly when to come, food timing was solid, bus boys knew exactly when to take our plates away, and the recommendations were right on.

Me n the husband started off the evening with a bourbon recommended by the bartender and a Belgian pale ale. Then moved on to their expertly crafted cocktails, Rye Tai (decorated with a large sprig of mint) and Kentucky Daisy (hidden inside was a long orange peel). Next, come here for their Michelin star winning food. As vegetarians, we really appreciated a separate menu that neatly listed all our options on the menu (those tiny letters in dim lighting can be hard to read after 4 drinks :)). We got the Agnolotti (5 stars), slow roasted cauliflower (a must-try whether you're a vegetarian or not) and the risotto with a slow-poached egg (4 stars). Lastly, come here for the desserts. We only had room for one and got the churros. They're not like the crispy stuff that I know and love but like linear beignets accompanied by a warm white chocolaty sauce.

Little did they know, L&E was already on our \"Must go here while in Chicago\" list because of an area search.We went here for breakfast twice. The 1st time there were a lot of people waiting to be seated (20-30 min wait I believe). However, there were 2 bar seats open that we were told were free if we didnt want an actual table. Now, after having eaten here, I would gladly wait an hour or more for a seat. But if theres a bar seat open and youre not w/ a big group, I highly recommend taking it. Itll get their delicious food in front of you faster.My husband had the Cinnamon Spiced Brioche French Toast the 1st time we went, and the PBR breakfast (sans the PBR) the second. He enjoyed both, though he would advise that if you order the PBR breakfast that youd like the actual PBR. He didnt make the distinction and didnt get it.I had the Biscuits and Gravy the 1st time we went and the Chicken, Waffles, and Sweet Potato Hash the 2nd. It was my 1st time trying both anywhere and I think Im ruined on them both forever. The biscuits were light, yet dense and their gravy was delicious and a little spicy (a by product of the delicious sausage no doubt). The entire dish will melt in your mouth and while youll definitely be full after it, youll still crave more.The chicken for the chicken and waffles had the perfectly seasoned breading on it and the waffle was light and large and really doesnt need any syrup. Im usually not a fan of sweet potato anything, but that hash is phenomenal. They all complimented each other so well.The service was great as well.

L&E is one of those places, with food that is memorable and meticulous.FOOD- Venison Pate: though I'm not usually a fanatic of pate de campagne sorts, this one actually had that moist, spreadable richness that store-bought counterparts lack and replace with crumbles that fall off your toast and embed themselves into the carpet that's always somehow white. There was a hint of some clove and great spice. The pickled cauliflower cut through the spread with some mild acid. - Olives: it's weird to review olives. However, the freshness of olives sometimes hints at what to expect for later, much like how a dirty bathroom can equate to a similar-looking back kitchen. Light brine, not overly oiled, and unmuddled in flavor, these were generous portions that almost all the tables seemed to get. - Headcheese: Reminded me less of the cured kind of headcheese and more of the taste and texture of a well-braised pork shoulder. The quail egg spilling over the top of it definitely helped the dish out. Again, pickled vegetables (this time onions) were a plus. - Gruyere Donuts: savory desserts that are not just appetizers pretending to be desserts are rare finds. This one had the softness that resembled beignets and that nice nuttiness that worked. SERVICEThe busboy was really concerned about our dishes of only half-eaten food. Apparently, he believed that we were ready to throw in the towel after a whole half the pate was left, and a third of the gruyere donuts sat there still warm. After the fourth attempt to collect our food, my tone for \"no\" started to sound more confused than polite. He never came back after that. I preferred his absence over having to feel like a cheetah guarding a catch from hyenas.

No kidding.We went on a Thursday night on a total whim. We were driving right by it and were both hungry, so we stopped in to see what the wait was. By the time we had ordered and paid for our first beers, the hostess came over and led us to a nice two person table in the back room. Great atmosphere - dimly lit, simply (but tastefully) decorated, and an attractive crowd.After we ordered, the waitress brought over an amuse-bouche that had us licking the palm-sized plates clean. It was a drop of a delicious sweet cheese that I don't recall bathed in an apple soup and some sort of maple syrup-based sauce. Wow. What a way to start the meal.Then she brought over our appetizers, we had the braised lamb with miniature penne, a delicately prepared vegetarian agnolotti, and their home-marinated olives. They were all spectacular. The portions were appropriately sized given the flavors and richness of each dish and left us wanting more. Again, we were practically licking our plates clean.I was in the mood for a burger (afterall it is a gastropub, right?) and talked my wife into splitting one with me. We were not disappointed. The bacon it came with had clearly been prepared in a smoker for hours (if not days!). It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The burger too was perfectly cooked, juicy, and well spiced and served on a delicate brioche. The beef fat fries were a great compliment too.We skipped dessert out of sheer fullness, but the list looked delicious nonetheless.But the best part of all was when the waitress came over with the bill: $44 (excluding the two beers we ordered at the bar). $44!!! I practically fell out of my chair. We would have happily paid $144 for the quality of the food we were served. I've had better overall meals in my life, but I've never had a meal that tasted so good for $44 (or $64, $84, and probably $104 either).And that's why I say that that meal was among the best on a \"cost-per-unit-of-enjoyment\" basis that we've ever had.

I just really like those fries. Don't judge.Anyway, the food is really good, but I almost gave this place 3 stars, because on Father's Day, we waited over an hour for our food. My benedict was initially cold, and a cold poached egg is not so good. They brought me a whole new warm benedict with my beef-fat fries though.

The only thing I don't like about going to Longman & Eagle is having to wait for a table, but that shouldn't count against anyone considering it happens when a place is doing something right.Eggs are a subtle art, the nuances of which are something I am very sensitive to. When a menu offers all kinds of wild creations like duck egg hash or chorizo strada, one might wonder why someone would order regular (chicken) eggs and potatoes, or as L&E calls it, the PBR breakfast. The way I test an establishment's ability to prepare breakfast is simple, order the eggs and potatoes with bacon or sausage and see how they treat it. Out of all the places I've been since moving to Chicago, this place in particular has really passed the test.The PBR breakfast comes with two artfully prepared eggs. I like over-medium, which shouldn't be hard, but shouldn't run all over the plate and they seem to get it. The potatoes are full of large chunks that fall apart nicely, mixed with bacon and chives. The large helping of bacon is high quality and arranged into a little (maybe not so little) \u00a0floret, which is an amusing touch. It comes with a can of PBR which somehow works, though I often opt out of that part. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with toast. It's not enough to sway me though.I've also had the chicken and waffle, which is fantastic. The best fried chicken I've ever had. I've tried the crab benedict, very good. The market omelet with little ferns is wonderful as well. The bloody maries are different every time. I've had gherkins added as well as chunks of cheddar.Overall it's always a treat.

We arrived around 6:15 on a Thursday to a bustling atmosphere and grabbed a drink while we waited for a table. The beer list is absolutely amazing--they have about 10-15 beers on tap and a very large bottle selection. Also, their whiskey/bourbon selection is also noteworthy, but I have yet to dive into this as I always get distracted by their beer list.We were seated about 30 or so minutes after we arrived and our party of four began to pour over the menu. I like how the menu is divided up into \"bar snacks\", \"small plates\", and then \"entrees\". There really isn't much of a difference between the bar snacks and the small plates, except that the portion sizes may be a teensy bit larger with the small plates. We each picked one of the following to start out with (and share, obviously):1) Swan Creek Rabbit Pat\u00e9, Giardini\u00e8re, Sourdough Tartines: I feel that it's important to mention that this was wrapped in bacon, so it immediately gained a star in my book. It was rich and flavorful and paired nicely with the peppers of the giardinere. It wasn't visually appealing by any stretch of the imagination, but it was tasty.2) Buffalo Sweetbreads, Aerated Ranch, Hot Sauce, Thumbelina Carrots, Micro Celery: My, my, my... I could've eaten an entire entree of just this. Imagine your favorite chicken wings amplified and taken to the millionth power. Yep, not kidding, that good. The aerated ranch was exceptional. I didn't quite know what to expect but it was delicious and incredible. 3) Roasted Marrow Bones: These are always delicious--nice and fatty and fantastic with the jam and salt. The presentation on this is amazing.4) Fried soft-shell crab: This was extremely flavorful and was devoured within minutes, I unfortunately can't find any mention of the exact details of this on their website, but if it's on the menu, get it!We then decided to share three of the entrees between the four of us:1) Suckling Pig: This dish literally fell apart, it was that tender and succulent. It had a bacon corn grit type of base to the dish that really brought out the flavors of the meat. Fantastically prepared and beautifully displayed.2) The Fish Special: The chef was out on the east coast the past weekend and flash froze some striped bass to bring back, so it in essence was 5 hours old. It was a tad fishy tasting in spite of its freshness, but it was still enjoyable. It was served with some fried green tomatoes, which I had never had, but were quite delicious.3) The Quail: There were 5-6 pieces of lightly fried quail served with cornbread and beans. This was outstanding and incredibly flavorful. The pairing of the cornbread with the beans and the tender meat of the quail was to die for.Any pork dish that I've had from Longman has always been solid, so do yourself a favor and pick anything as they change their pork offering frequently.We sadly didn't have room for dessert, which I was unfortunate as their desserts are incredible. Our waitress gave us a free mini shot of a featured whiskey and a piece of a chocolate cookie which was a nice touch.If I could, I'd frequent Longman a lot more, but it always does a fair amount of damage to my wallet so I'm glad it's a hike from my apartment! \u00a0Also, as an interesting aside, \"No Reservations\" was filming there last night sans Anthony Bourdain.", "Date": "2012-07-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jay I.", "ReviewID": "PjmuUh2eQRpuMlQ8M2PGPQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since the boka experience, longman and eagle was my second stint of michelin awarded restaurant. \u00a0I thought the ambience was great. \u00a0We ordered, since we had to wait for an hour or so before being seated, a non-alcoholic bloody mary, which was so so at best (I don't drink alcholol, so I am missing all the fun part).Their food was great. \u00a0My chicken waffle was surely one of a kind. \u00a0The chicken was cooked perfectly, soft, crispy but not soggy and had a unique taste. \u00a0My wife's fennel salad? was also good. \u00a0The lentil and the raisin had a perfect match.This is a definitely 4-4.5 star restaurant which huge potential to have 5 in my next visit. \u00a0We will see.", "Date": "2012-08-12", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Will V.", "ReviewID": "paPyYGD1N6JZy71YUPNvew", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We stopped here after a movie at the Logan Theatre.

The hostess told us our table was ready shortly after that, but we stayed at the bar. So their estimated wait was about twice as long as what it turned out to be.We both had the house special hot toddy, and it was warm and lemony delicious. The bar is well-stocked, with what appears to be a strong bias for whiskeys, and a nice selection of tap and bottled brews. The menu reveals Longman & Eagle to be an interesting gastropub, with plenty of meat selections, but also a fair number of fish and veg items. We started with the pretzel with Welsh rarebit, a cheesy mustardy sauce I had never before tried. Very tasty. The pretzel was warm, crispy on the outside, and unsalted. I moved on to the sunchoke bisque with scallops. The bisque was quite creamy and delicious, but I did have one problem with it. It was a fairly small portion served in an oversized bowl, and the bowl very obviously cooled the bisque before it made it to my seat at the bar. It was warm in the center, but quite lukewarm near the edges. A bowl that size containing a smaller portion of soup, should have been preheated, in my opinion. I think this was a fairly amateur mistake, and one easily corrected. Hopefully they will see this review and do just that.Other than that, I loved the place. The service was excellent. it did get fairly crowded and noisy at the bar, but that's the way it goes at a hot new spot on a Friday night.

But to their credit, every whipped up whatever was fantastic. I didn't know you could do that to turnips.The tables were pretty cramped and I felt like the busboys were waiting, poised to leap at the table and snatch away the plates as our forks lifted the last morsel of food from them. Probably because the busboys were indeed waiting by our table and eyeing us, poised to leap at the table to take away our plates. Were they running low on plates? Or did they just want us to pour our food into our gullets and move along so they could stuff another couple of eager bearded plaid-wearing patrons into our spot?Whatever the case, I felt hurried along about the food and deprived about drinks. I didn't think a water refill and a beer with dinner was unreasonable, but I guess that's just how it goes when you're seating 60 people in a room meant for 25.

Once our table was ready we were kindly invited inside. Their decor is simple, but their par is impressive. An collection of liquor and liqueurs that would make any mixologist drool. Their menu is awesome on multiple level. Items change from time to time, while the staples remain. There's a perfect balance between snacks, small plates, salads and Sammy's, and legit entrees. We feasted like we may be getting the electric chair later that night. A selection of cheeses to start, their pork rillette, rabbit pate, and even the slagel family meatballs. The cheese board was impressive, the rillette was gone in seconds, but the rabbit pate was a tad bit dry and lacking of richness (nice texture though). The meatballs were unholy good. We had a pork shoulder and nudi (pasta) that are no longer on the menu. Both were scrumptious. However, they appear to be always adding new and interesting items. Duck testicles anyone? I'd be game! Other entrees were the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe and the Tete de cuchon. The sloppy Joe was kind of forgettable. Good in it's own rights, but probably not something I'd order again. The Tete de cuchon had us stabbing each other in our fingers. Their drinks are fantastic. There's a lot attention and care put into making them. I don't remember what we all ordered ( I wonder why???). I do know that each drink was far different than the last and all were very good.

The remoulade/tartar sauce slaw concoction was a great accent to the perfectly lightly fried clams. I will, however, note that the clams were very clammy so if you're on the fence about clams this may not be the dish for you. In my opinion, the clams could have used an extra rinsing, they seemed a little too gritty, but it may be just the type of clam they used.For our entree, we split the pork belly, which was perfectly roasted, although I think it may have been confit (ed) based on the texture.

Everyone who works there is so friendly and excited about the food, and all of Longman & Eagle seems well thought-out and perfected. Oh, and the gorgeous rooms for rent are reminiscent of an old-style pub. Now, the food: stellar vegetarian menu that is extensive and fresh. I've had the pretzel roll starter, the goat cheese melon salad, and the English Pea Aglonotti, and they're all equally delicious and fresh. The vegetables are so full of flavor and fresh each time we come here, and there's usually an optional add-in vegetable that's fresh that day (the other day it was morel mushrooms.)And maybe most importantly, the drinks. I've tried many of them, but for the summer I'm particularly fond of the Moria Solina, a fresh pisco/lemon soda cocktail that is light and perfect, and the Ransometta, a deliciously rich gin cocktail that I can only describe as the Martinezs' hotter, hipper younger sister.

\u00a0With trepidation, I called the restaurant at noon on Saturday to strategize a time when a party of six could most likely be seated without the inevitable hour-long wait. \u00a0The supremely friendly host suggested anything before 5:30 (yikes!), but I was truly impressed with his calm and understanding demeanor, and our guests were willing to chance it. \u00a0Onward!WARNING - SHORT COMPLAINT TO FOLLOW:I truly don't understand why a restaurant like this would not offer reservations!?! \u00a0For the amount of time I spent on the phone with their host, I could've made 4 different resos for 4 different days, and I know I'm not the only one doing this! \u00a0But I digress...OKAY, COMPLAINING IS OVER; BACK TO THE GOOD STUFF!We arrived at 5:15 and Mark parked (street parking is pretty decent) while I told the host our party had all arrived, and gestured outside. \u00a0He did actually count us, and even asked if \"our sixth\" was parking. \u00a0Dude, don't mess with these guys!Once Mark rounded the corner (yes, they made us wait until we were ALL within eyesight), we were seated within five minutes. \u00a0At 5:25pm. \u00a0YAY! \u00a0My reservation anxiety quickly dissolved into the warm wooden tables and I got down to the task of drinking and fooding!I guess we got lucky with the service, because our waiter was incredibly helpful and warm. \u00a0He coped with all our weird quirks, and offered suggestions. \u00a0Below are our dinner choices in order of my preference:Drinks:#1) Gin Fizz: My choice, and a good one. \u00a0This cocktail was perfectly snappy, slightly sweet with a lovely juniper kick. \u00a0A gorgeous beverage for pairing with any meal.#2) Old Fashioned with Rye: Mark's pick, and he ordered two so they were above average.Apps/Small Plates/Bar Plates:#1) Pretzel & Welsh Rarebit - soft German-style pretzel and what's basically a beer cheddar sauce. \u00a0WHAT?? \u00a0Order me three and get your own! \u00a0Crunchy-chewy pretzel boasted a gorgeous dark amber salted coating, and the cheese sauce had an IPA-style snap that lightened what would otherwise have been a very heavy pairing.#2) Artisanal Cheese Selection, Fruit Mostarda, Crostini - unassumingly gorgeous. \u00a0The fruit mostarda and creamy brie-like cheese were my faves.#3) House Marinated Olives - a lovely combination of briny, salty, tangy, meaty goodness. \u00a0These were special.We skipped the salads and went straight to the entrees:#1) Pan Roasted Skate Wing, Black Trumpets, Shaved Fennel & Arugula, Blue Crab - my Norwegian companion declared his entree \"one of the best fish dishes I've ever tasted,\" and his plate couldn't have gotten any cleaner if he had picked up the dish and licked it. \u00a0I'd say that was a success!#2) Zabuton of Slagel Family Farm Beef, Lobster Tater Tots, Creamed Edamame, Abalone Mushrooms, Sauce Zingara - The beef was prepared precisely to medium with a gorgeous pink center and tender, well-seasoned slices; no salt necessary. \u00a0I'm not a mushroom person, but I braved them...and they tasted just like any other mushroom (meaning I didn't care for them, but I'm definitely not the person to ask). \u00a0And LOBSTER TATER TOTS?? \u00a0Yeah, those were gone fast. \u00a0Gotta love Chicago.#3) The rest of our party all ordered an off-menu special of veal steak, and each of them said it was exceptional.Desserts:#1) Dark Chocolate Crispy Fernet Pave, Malt Gelato, Caramel Pudding - chocolate cake for royalty. \u00a0The cake is super-rich and dense, the malt gelato a welcome breeze, and that caramel pudding could literally be poured into a martini glass and I would drink it straight, it's so delicious.#2) Chocolate & Currant Trifle, Salted Treacle Mousse, Molasses Cream, Juniper Cubes, Lemon & Bangladeshi Bay Leaf Shortbread - the super-long name belies this dish's clean and simple flavor. \u00a0The only miss here were the juniper cubes, which lacked real depth of flavor and were hard to chew; sort of like a cold peeled grape. \u00a0I enjoyed the slightly tart and luxuriously creamy mousse tremendously; and the molasses cream complemented the dish well without being overbearing.The men also each enjoyed a flight of three bourbons during our dessert, and our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the entire liquor menu. \u00a0Big plus.All of this does come with a healthy price tag, but frankly, this entire menu plus drinks, a bottle of wine and coffee came to under $100 per person. \u00a0I've spent a lot more for a lot less, and I walked away impressed.p.s.

Had the shrimp and grits; sauce totally dominated the dish and was way out of whack, ratio-wise, to the S&G. Much, too much. Shrimp: Cooked fairly well. Overall, an OK dish, hardly great. Dad had the Biscuits and Gravy and he said the flavor of the gravy was still with him an hour and a half later. And not in a good way. I tasted the gravy; I can see what he meant. Biscuits were good, though, flaky and buttery. Mom's bacon was crispy and very tasty, salty goodness. Her eggs were cooked well. My \"one hour\" eggs had not reached the custardy quality they were apparently going for. They were still too runny and unevenly cooked.Service: Perfectly fine. Not special. Good. A solid good. Coffee (which was very good, by the way) was promptly filled.Decor/ambiance: I like it. Comfortable. Although I must say it gets noisy in there. Be forewarned. It's full of cool people, but I did not feel out of place with my nearly 70-year-old parents. But then again, they are cool people.Price: A little high, but not offensive.Overall: Both visits left me wanting more. The first time we went, my Dad's dish was served way too cold.

This was just a small bite of pork pate with red peppers (I think?) on the top. Whatever it was, it was delicious. Off to a great start! Thanks, chef!Next up? House-marinated olives. .. because we love olives and you can rarely go wrong with house-marinated olives.Duck rillettes with mustard, buttered toasts and cornichons (fancy name for baby dill pickles!). The rillettes is cooked down meat in fat and served jar. It's spread on toasts and topped with a bit of mustard. \u00a0The rillettes was soooo good. I'd go back just for this dish.Next up we split smoked sweetbreads with salsify, roasted beet, and brown butter applesauce. If you don't know what sweetbreads are, don't look it up because you don't want to know. Just know that this dish was really tasty and better than the sweetbreads I had at Custom House, the only other time I've had them. I think maybe because they weren't fried.For my meal (I know! I've eaten so much already!) I got the wild boar sloppy joe with crispy sage, onion, pickled jalape\u00f1o. This sandwich was pretty great. I thought the jalepeno would be too spicy, but it was not. The onions were perfeclty crispy and the boar had just the right spice. I liked this, but it wasn't my favorite of the night.For my friend's main dish she got the pork belly confit, pumpkin risotto, chestnuts, apple, and soy-caramel broth. This was another stand out dish (along with the rillettes). Very well balanced. The pork was salty the soy was salty, the risotto and apple was sweet, but not overly. Nutty crunch of the chestnuts. Awesome.By this point we were so stuffed that we couldn't move, but that did not stop us from ordering classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with plum compote and langue du chat cookies. Again, very well balanced. The creme brluee had the perfect crunch on the top and was creamy inside. It was sweet and the plum compote was a great tangy compliment.At dinner I drank Half Acre Daisy Cutter Pale Ale. My friend had a Manhattan that she nursed throughout dinner. Good, but strong!

I had the Shrubbery - delicious. The cranberry shrub (a fruit reduction/vinegar) gave the drink a nice fruitiness without being overly sweet. It complemented the bourbon wonderfully. Food wise, we sampled several plates. My favorite was their chanterelle pasta entree with artichoke hearts. The mushrooms were buttery and divine.

Stopped in for a Friday lunch last week and was seated outside on a beautiful day. It started out great, but after 50 minutes and no food something was definitely not right. Then when our waiter walked by and asked \u00a0\"you ladies ate already right?\" we were obviously a little surprised/concerned. 5 minutes later they tried to give us an the wrong order....then he came back and tried to give it to us again, seriously. \u00a0Finally when our meal was delivered our salad was missing its key ingredients a compressed melon and fig salad without figs. . Once our waiter came back \u00a0we asked about the figs our waiter finally came back 15 minutes later, he brought a 1/2 of a fig on the side and apologized. Finally our meal came, and my friends omelet tasted likes something you could order from a \u00a0diner on the corner and my wild boar sloppy joe (which I've had before) tasted bland and unseasoned. To make it worse, \u00a0our waiter didn't even offer to take off anything on our bill. Coming from a Michelin Star restaurant, this shouldn't be something the customer has to ask for after such poor/late service and a clearly poorly executed meal.

Luckily, I ended up there yesterday on a total whim. I was hanging out with a pal who lives down the street from here, and when we ran into his neighbors, we all decided to head on over for some dinner and drinks. I'm so glad we did.Between the 4 of us, I think we ordered just about half of the menu. Lucky for you, you get to listen to me gush about all of it. Pretzel and welsh rarebit - it's piping hot and you dip it in beer cheese. It's amazing, duh. Roasted bone marrow with bacon shallot jam, served with sourdough toast points and sea salt. It made the same friend that said \u00a0\"I'm not eating that, bleh\" a believer in the power of meat butter. Perfectly sweet and salty, crunchy and creamy. Damn. Maine lobster parfait is stupid good. Large chunks of buttery lobster, layered over a parsnip puree with bacon and a red wine sauce. Double damn. As an aside, I think that putting lobster AND bacon in the same dish is pretty much cheating, amiright? We also shared the sepia (squid, in case you didn't know. I didn't). It was served with an oxtail ragout and romesco sauce. Such a well balanced dish. The chef sent us a complimentary amouse of lightly battered white fish served w a garlic aoli. A delicious little bite. As for the entrees, two of us ordered the pork belly with pumpkin risotto and chestnuts. This dish was so incredibly rich. It's pork and pumpkin, ferchrissakes, you can't go wrong. I also tried the duck 3 ways (meatball, rillette, and meatloaf topped w a quail egg, OMG!) and the roasted cauliflower with lentils. I can see why the vegetarians nerd out on this joint - it was awesome. Finally, dessert. Not than any of us had room for it, but how could we say no to dark chocolate ganache, salted carmel custard and almond cake topped w warm salted carmel. Oh and almond brittle. I blew my diet all the way to hell, yesterday.For the whiskey/ bourbon drinkers - the list is extensive and impressive. I passed on cocktails yesterday, and opted for beer. The gentlemen enjoyed their manhattans and the other young lady \u00a0chose a lovely blush for dinner. If you can't find a drink here that you like, then you can't find one anywhere. We got there at about 6pm on a Sunday and the place was jammin. We only waited about 15 mins for a 4 top. The decor is dark and manly feeling. I dig it. Our service was perfect - that perfect balance between attentive but not overly so. \u00a0As I mentioned, this whole trip happened on a whim. I initially planned on spending the day on the couch with my fella, but a drink with friends can turn into an afternoon and evening gone in the blink of an eye. That said, I needed to bring home a great dinner so that I could save face and once again become the great girlfriend that I am. Nothing says \"I LOVE YOU\" or \"I'M SORRY I SPENT ALL DAY EATING AND DRINKING w/o YOU\" like short ribs served with a foie gras and marrow dumpling, mushrooms, and salsify. I have to admit, I felt like a total dick ordering takeout from L&E, but desperate times call for desperate measures. He ate, and we fell asleep on the couch watching Netflix.

\u00a0We really haven't ever had anything bad there though so try whatever and I am sure it will be great.A minor downside: It is not a great place to bring vegetarian or vegan friends. \u00a0While they DO have a veggie menu, it is not nearly as extensive as their regular menu. \u00a0But come on people... animals are delicious. \u00a0Get with it.Something people think is a downside but really isn't: They don't take reservations. \u00a0This is good. \u00a0If they did, you would not be able to eat there. \u00a0Honestly, try to make a reservation at another restaurant with comparable food and you will be looking at a several month long wait. \u00a0Two hours is nothing compared to that and the wait is almost never that long. \u00a0While you are waiting for your food, walk around Logan Square and check out some of the boutiques or grab a drink at one of the local bars. \u00a0Or better yet, sit down and enjoy one of the most extensive and well thought out beer, liquor and wine lists I have ever encountered. \u00a0Ask the L&E bartender for a recommendation on one of their seasonal mixed drinks or a good beer and prepare to enjoy yourself. \u00a0Crack some jokes with the GM Will, or strike up a conversation with one of the other interesting people who is waiting for a table. \u00a0None of the above options have ever gone wrong for us so far. \u00a0Or, last but not least, just go get dinner early. \u00a0:)This place is awesome. \u00a0Get there.", "Date": "2012-11-12", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ghostfaceknitter W.", "ReviewID": "SCP-Q5vfU4kLpVZYqm2zVw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only been here for brunch, but it was great!

\u00a0And I've had a medium burger before. \u00a0But I don't think that I should see a cooked edge stuffed with raw meat that can be scooped out with a fork. \u00a0And I don't think the bottom bun should be bright red and disgustingly soggy and wet. \u00a0So, we called our waiter back again. \u00a0He was very understanding, again. \u00a0And though we had only been at our table for half an hour and hadn't taken so much as a single bite of food, when he took our burgers off the table, the over-attentive bus staff completely cleared our table of napkins and utensils, as if we were finished.A second waiter took us over, as I suppose we were the problem table of the evening. \u00a0Our burgers were returned, with a free bowl of fries for us to share in the middle of the table. \u00a0The burgers were cooked properly, cheesed properly, presented properly...they just tasted like nothing. \u00a0Dry, bread-y, and unseasoned. \u00a0We shared a napkin I'd been lucky enough to have hidden in my lap when the bus staff swooped in, while watching the tables on each side of us receive cute little samples from the kitchen and refills of water. \u00a0That restaurant was finished with us, obviously. \u00a0You could tell the waiters felt bad but--seriously? \u00a0Raw burgers after 2 hours in the place, and you bring us a bowl of fries to complement the fries that come with the meal?It's really a shame that this place has gotten so highly rated. \u00a0When it was new, I enjoyed it, even with the wait. \u00a0It wasn't packed with loud, drunk douchebags who are only there because of an Esquire article, so waiting was tolerable. \u00a0The kitchen was still trying to become highly rated, so the kitchen was still trying. \u00a0Now that they're lauded as The Place To Go in Logan Square, they're sticking to whatever gets people in and out the quickest. \u00a0That's because as soon as the droves of people who believe everything they read start to darken the doorway, the place could serve sliced canned dog food with a sprig of something styled \"wild crimson fennel\" on top and nobody will know the difference. \u00a0\"Oh my God, you have GOT to try the sliced dog food with the wild crimson fennel! \u00a0It's simply to DIE for!!!\"", "Date": "2010-12-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Justin R.", "ReviewID": "cHkbU-bGci2Aho_13nHIRw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place has great food I did a menu sampling of five items and everything was wonderful.

I swallowed my pride long enough to ask the 5 W's and hung up the phone enraged. Fuming, I vowed to myself and anyone within earshot to get there sometime in the near future. \u00a0How could I not have at least HEARD or READ about this place? Get it together KK...u slippin' boo. Finally, my opportunity came in the form of a brunch invite from the BD one Sunday afternoon. \"Any suggestions?\" he queried. \"As a matter of fact I do...Longman and Eagle,\" I eagerly replied. So I scooped up the child and off we went.We arrived to a 30-minute wait inside and out, so our friendly hostess suggested we wait at the bar. We grabbed a couple of seats and basked in the gastropub ambiance, which reminded me of the bar in the movie The Crying Game. Not super fancy, kind of dark and dank, but totally sexy. What's more, I only recently found out about the whole gastropub phenomena when I attended a party at The Spotted Pig in NYC last fall, so I was really excited to see what L & E was workin' with. And what they were workin' with was a whole lotta deliciousness. At the bar, I ordered a spicy Bloody Mary which was prepared exactly the way I like it and when the bartender slid a tiny glass of beer in front of me, I thought maybe it was a liquid amuse bouche. But before I drank it, I just had to ask, \"Ummm...what's this and is it mine?\" He could've given me the \"You hideously uncultured, uneducated diner, you\" look, \u00a0but instead, he explained that it was a beer back to go with my Bloody Mary. Oh. He then went on to explain that it was from Amsterdam, Prague, Belgium or some other European city where those fancy ales that my brothers like to drink come from. \u00a0Oh.Once we were seated, The BD and I both were immediately sold on the fried chicken and waffles served with sweet potato and pork belly hash. Since they didn't have MIckey Mouse pancakes or hotdogs, baby girl went with the Yo Gabba Gabba French toast (Brioche French toast with peach compote and bacon pudding). I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the deliciousness of the fried chicken I was about to receive because I have been bitterly disappointed by what I've had at restaurants lately, but that yard bird over there...OMG cubed! Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and perfectly seasoned all over. Were those really tatted up white boys with gauged earlobe piercings back there frying that up or was there a black lady who looks like Mammy from Tom and Jerry doing the cooking? Am I wrong or racist for saying that? Some might think so, but I'm not....just speaking from my personal experiences with fried chicken. BD agreed. As for the waffles, I don't think anyone can really screw them up but these seemed other-worldly---as if they were rocketed in from Planet Waffle. When our waiter, Joey, placed baby girl's French Toast in front of her, she excitedly asked,\" Are those my Yo Gabba Gabba pancakes?\" Joey was cool enough to go along with it and even launched into a discussion with her about different characters on the show and who was her fave (thanks Joey). As she happily ate her food, she offered me a bite and I could see why she was so joyous. That was some damned good French Toast and the bacon pudding (which I've never had or even heard of before in life) was killin 'em. I even ordered the prawns and grits to go because I couldn't NOT have them---how often do you see that on a menu? The prawns were savory and tender and the grits were thick, creamy and buttery, exactly the way they should be.Longman and Eagle is a bit pricey for brunch and service was a bit \"leisurely,\" \u00a0but well worth it.

The photos on the website looked super cute but the bathrooms looked slightly challenging for super modest couples (read: they're in the shower?) and I kept reading in reviews about the hotel part being an afterthought, the staff being disorganized, etc. Let me just say, the rooms are absolutely lovely down to the tiniest detail and the staff could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. Due to their availability for the dates we were in Chicago, we actually got to stay in two different rooms- #13 which is the cheapest room at just $75 a night and #55- which is the largest room and features a \"party shower\" and an adorable claw foot tub. I actually quite liked both rooms even though #13 is pretty small. You check in at the restaurant which was super easy and made us more than excited to come back down for drinks and eats later (kinda like checking into a B&B, only take out all the weird and annoying parts). Upon entering the stairway to the rooms we were welcomed by a strong odor of new wood and a giant fur skin (coyote?). #13 had everything we could want for a smallish super affordable place to stay for the night. There's an Apple TV where you can watch unlimited netflix, a mini-fridge featuring organic ginger ale, local microbrews, etc., a bottle opener attached to the wall, a shower where I counted 5(!) shampoos in total, complimentary bottled local water, and my favorite part of all, free whiskey tokens to be enjoyed at the bar downstairs! Oh yeah, and as for the toilet in the shower, admittedly kinda weird, and it does get wet when you take a shower. But is it a deal breaker? No way. And considering the fact that it allows more space for the actual room, I kinda get it.When we checked into our next room, #55, we planned to just leave our stuff with the staff, and come back later in the afternoon after check-in time (3pm) but instead when we came in to the restaurant around 12:30, we were given the keys and told we were welcome to get settled. #55 is pretty incredible. It reminded me of staying at the Ace in Portland. You basically feel like you're staying at your super cool friend's studio. The wall behind the bed features exposed brick, there's a good sized table where we ate takeout from Lula one night, there's the previously mentioned claw foot tub, plus his & hers sinks. Oh yeah, a vintage tape player, crazy amazing mix tapes for all tastes (folk jams, classic rap, rock n' roll, etc.) which are also available for purchase if you happen to fall that in love with them, a pretty eclectic variety of books to peruse, etc. Seriously, I kinda just wanted to hang out in the room instead of exploring Chicago or hanging out with our friends. It's that good. Other stuff I feel obligated to mention: + The amenities! The comp. shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, and body lotion smelled AMAZING and I believe sincerely helped with the ongoing hangovers we seemed to continually wake up with. +I fell in love with the grass scented candle in the minibar basket and decided to light it one night. I was worried I may have just purchased a $40 candle, but nope, for $12 it was totally worth it and made for a good souvenir to bring home. +We wanted champagne and checked out the liquor store next door and couldn't stomach the prices for a decent bottle so we ended up ordering a carafe of champs from room service for a fraction of the price! +The location couldn't have been any more convenient. Most of our friends live around Logan Square which used to make staying downtown a total pain. L&E is located directly across the street from the Logan Square blue line stop which meant a much shorter distance from O'Hare and only a 3 minute train trip from Wicker Park for our favorite falafels. +Hotel guests receive priority seating in the restaurant which meant we ended up eating their a total of 3 times. We never had to experience any waits and felt kinda like L&E royalty. :)FINALLY A NOTE ABOUT THE RESTAURANT/BAR:We had breakfast, lunch, dinner, several pretzels with beer cheese sauce and many, many, drinks at L&E while we were staying. Everything was so dang good it really made it hard to want to go anywhere else. Chad waited on us the most at the bar, who was super friendly, knowledgeable without being pretentious, and just well, a cool dude. I had one of the best omelettes of my life there, and the coffee is delicious. Oh yeah, we're both vegetarian and for a place known for it's creativity with meat, we were super stoked that they offered a separate veggie menu. Whew.

Brewery. \u00a0They have a ton of cocktails and their bartenders will gladly make recommendations, especially if you're in the mood for some whiskey.We only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, so we were seated in a cozy little corner of the restaurant. \u00a0As a warning, the space between tables is almost non-existent, so prepare to sit very close to the other diners around you. \u00a0If this bothers you, I probably wouldn't come here for dinner. \u00a0Just saying. \u00a0We started our meal off with some Country P\u00e2t\u00e9 - it was pretty good but a bit on the salty side. \u00a0I've definitely had better, but this was pretty good for something I didn't even expect to be on their menu. \u00a0I decided on the Kobe Burger for my entree and was less than impressed. \u00a0The burger was good (hey, it's Kobe beef) but I asked for it cooked 'medium' and it was almost entirely well-done. \u00a0I feel like I can be totally picky about that considering it's a good meat and it shouldn't really be overdone. \u00a0The burger was still good (especially with all the fixins and the fries on the side) but it could have been better had it not been almost burnt by the time I got it. \u00a0We had a good dessert of banana something or other and really enjoyed it. \u00a0It was a nice end to a really nice meal. \u00a0I'm excited that LS has a new bar in the area, but beware: it gets packed pretty easily and there's an even longer wait for dinner if you come in around 8 or 8:30. \u00a0The weekends are super busy and I'm not sure if you can eat at the bar, so you may have to wait. \u00a0There's almost no free street parking in the area anymore, so you'll want to take the L (the LS Blue Line stop is across the street) or park in the Pay Box parking lot across the street. \u00a0If you're unimpressed with the wait, you can always step next door to El Cid 2 and get a table outside on their patio.", "Date": "2010-06-01", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kris R.", "ReviewID": "Qy7vI3_FGXkPo4CyaoU18g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "came here for my birthday this year, and of course i wasn't disappointed. \u00a0same deal, we scored a seat at the bar, luckily! \u00a0 \u00a0the only thing i have to mention is the bone marrow. \u00a0ORDER IT. \u00a0it's awesome. \u00a0gross, but still amazing - you have to try it. \u00a0i'm going to say no more. \u00a0just do it.", "Date": "2012-01-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mary M.", "ReviewID": "lLafSpgI34uq-xQrCGYPsg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I live down the street from Longman and Eagle and I have taken my family there for brunch, I've recommended it to coworkers and I go there for drinks with friends on a regular basis.

he was attentive and helpful. \u00a0The only hitches were some delays at the bar, for which our waiter apologized each time.The $8 cocktails were impressive. \u00a0The Harvest Sidecar was excellent, refreshing and sweet, with applejack, Cointreau, pear liqueur, fresh lemon, nutmeg, and a housemade pimento dram. \u00a0I also loved the Monk's Cooler with bourbon, lemon, rosemary syrup, orange bitters, and Monk's Cafe beer. \u00a0It was very refreshing, with a great herbal fragrance from the rosemary syrup and a giant rosemary sprig garnish. \u00a0The Longman Manhattan was a pretty good, smooth version of the classic, with bourbon, Punt \u00e9 Mes, and angostura and cherry bitters. \u00a0I was indifferent to the Shrubbery, a surprisingly sweet drink with bourbon, amaretto, lemon, and Old Fashioned bitters. \u00a0I closed out dinner with the Yuzu Toddy - Marker's Mark, applejack, lemon, yuzu honey, and hot water. \u00a0It was a particularly strong drink, releasing hot alcoholic fumes from several inches away, but if you like bourbon and yuzu tea, then you should love this.The food ranged from fair to excellent, with the better dishes weighted towards the smaller plates. \u00a0We started with the warm cheese gougeres stuffed with a Dunbarton blue Mornay sauce. \u00a0These were like savory choux creams, with sweet pastry dough stuffed with the oozing blue cheese sauce. \u00a0The buffalo sweetbreads smacked us with even more flavor, the soft sweetbreads deep fried and coated in hot sauce. \u00a0I loved the texture of the sweetbreads, and they went wonderfully with the light, almost foamy aerated ranch, as well as the Thumbelina carrots and micro celery. \u00a0My favorite dish of the night was the rabbit pat\u00e9 with giardini\u00e8re pickles and sourdough tartines. \u00a0This was despite the fact that the toasted sourdough was rock hard and inedible. \u00a0Luckily the pat\u00e9 spoke for itself, well spiced and meaty and just a bit gamey, bordered in a little bit of bacon. \u00a0The pickles, an assortment of julienned vegetables laced through with mustard seeds, were the perfect lightening touch, helped too by a generous helping of grainy mustard.The meal curved downhill from there, though there were still good things to come. \u00a0My least favorite dish was the pastrami spiced pig head, which made the rabbit pat\u00e9 seem even more of a screaming success. \u00a0The pig head was dry and chalky and flatly flavored, served with a mix of doughy sauerkraut gnocchi, dehydrated rye, shaved pear-watercress salad, and thousand island sugo that didn't add up to much. \u00a0The flavor profile smacked me as dull. \u00a0The roasted marrow bones were better, with red onion jam, sea salt, and sourdough crostinis. \u00a0I've probably had better bone marrow, but this was delightful, and I liked the sweet onion jam. \u00a0The crostini were also soft and edible, which was a plus.The bigger dishes were less successful on average, but I did really like the wild boar sloppy joe. \u00a0This was a sandwich on fluffy brioche with a lot of soft wild boar with a chili-like texture and flavor, topped with crispy sage, onion, and pickled jalape\u00f1o. \u00a0The jalape\u00f1o was seriously hot, and perhaps distracting, but the dish was great. \u00a0I also loved the crispy beef fat fries, cooked very well done with plenty of salt. \u00a0Our last two dishes, though, were not great. \u00a0The hand rolled cavatelli had its moments, namely the tender hunks of artichoke, but the pasta was too doughy. \u00a0It also came with rapini, chanterelles, truffle butter, grana padano, and a matsutake puree, but most of that did not deliver as much as I'd hoped. \u00a0The dish was also quite salty. \u00a0I wouldn't recommend the \"Steak and Egg\" either, a fairly boring dish of beef short rib, with pickled ramps, black trumpet mushrooms, bordelaise sauce, and a farm egg and creamed spinach raviolo. \u00a0The beef was fine, but the raviolo was dry and bland, with the egg yolk fully cooked inside.Our dessert was quite good - a maple and bourbon cornbread pudding with huckleberry compote, date-bourbon custard, and charred olive oil ice cream. \u00a0The cornbread was rich but not overwhelming, and the ice cream was superb. \u00a0I'm glad we ended on a good note, as I liked Longman & Eagle overall. \u00a0Though the food sometimes missed, I really enjoyed the meal. \u00a0I'd recommend the place to anyone in search of good food and drink under one roof.", "Date": "2012-01-21", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "James P.", "ReviewID": "dt_02cqlcKCM3s4C59MhJw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Longman & Eagle for the perfect introduction to the food city of Chicago. \u00a0Brett D. sent me an email with a list of choices for Theresa W. and my first meal to Chicago. \u00a0The whisky is what caught my eye, but the food should be the focus of any visit here. \u00a0You know you are in a place that takes food seriously when bone marrow and pork belly find themselves on the menu. \u00a0We had a good sized group and we tried almost everything that night. \u00a0Brett D. would order and we would eat. \u00a0Longman & Eagle made for an amazing night and the best surprise was the bill. \u00a0It was not the kind of surprise where the meal was comped, but for the price point, it was the best meal for the least amount of money that we had in Chicago.", "Date": "2010-08-02", "Author_Location": "Thousand Oaks, CA"}, {"Author": "Sheila M.", "ReviewID": "azBj09JwplpC1yUkP2gLTw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went to Longman & Eagle a during the holiday season, which may have slightly added to our expected wait time of 1 1/2 hours, but the host's estimation was fairly accurate.

It seemed like every single table around us got multiple courses in the time it took us to get one. When this happens the waitress should look into the problem or at least offer an apology. Instead, she avoided our table like the plague. Finally, a woman I assumed was a manager offered an apology by dropping off literally a sip of whiskey for each member of our party. Really?? I wasn't expecting anything other than an apology but don't insult me with a pathetic offering \"for our troubles\".Second, the portions are teeny tiny. I read reviews and knew this in advance and I was still surprised. Really, they are that small. I had the scallops with braised oxtail and gnocchi. Where were my gnocchi? Oh, wait, are they those three small tubes at the bottom of my dish? I seriously thought it was part of the sauce. I kid you not, I went out later that night and had a second dinner at another restaurant. Third, other than my dish, the food just wasn't that good. My friend had the bouillabaisse with seafood and it had very little flavor. It's seafood! You'd think at least it would maintain some of that fish flavor, but nothing. And the amuse bouche was risotto. You're kidding me right? An amuse bouche, while tiny, is supposed to be complex and have layers of flavor. You should be able to focus on each element, even in just one tiny bite. The risotto was just risotto. Some may say it's free and I shouldn't complain, but I say have some pride in what you put on \u00a0the table and represent yourself in a better manner. Do something better than risotto.

Longman and Eagle uncharacteristically had a 15 minute wait, and as soon as we got there, two seats opened up at the bar. It seemed like fate.The meal had some exceptional components. Our drinks (manhattan and old fashioned) were simply the best versions of these cocktails I have ever tasted. Considering that I saw them using Maker's Mark, this is especially impressive. The old fashioned had strong orange/bitter aromas, but absolutely none of the cloyingly sweet flavor that comes from an incompetent mixer. My manhattan was brash and assertive, with just the right amount of bitters. Food wise, the bone marrow may challenge Avec's bacon-wrapped dates as the best small plate in Chicago. The bones are generously filled with delicious, impossibly rich marrow, and topped with just the right amount of the requisite cranberry/onion concoction. I found myself scooping out the marrow with my fingers, much to the chagrin of my roommate/dining partner and I'm sure everyone else at the bar. Also, this gets major points for not skimping on the bread; I can't tell you how many times I've ordered bone marrow, only to have it be unenjoyable because the chef expects me to eat all of it on three melba toasts or something. This was perfect.The other components of the meal were very good, but unmemorable. The pork cheek small plate (with lentils, some sort of naturally black green, and fermented apples) was well-balanced but by no means spectacular. The venison sausage small plate had delicious components (sauerkraut pierogi FTW), but the sausage itself was sort of unremarkable; I'm not sure I could have set it apart from Trader Joe's andouille on blind taste test. Still, it was a very good small plate. The wild boar sloppy joe that we (somehow) split was awesome overall; however, only the bites that included the grilled jalape\u00f1o were memorable, whereas those that didn't were simply good. Also, the bun was not the best in the world. The beef fat-fried french fries that came alongside were among the best fries I have had anywhere; unlike most places, the ketchup is served alongside to mellow the flavor of the spuds rather than add to them. The staff was hipster-ish but welcoming; not remotely aloof or arrogant. Pricing was surprisingly low (we got out sub-$40 for all of the aforementioned food, libations, tax, and tip). All in all, I greatly enjoyed my meal at L&E, but not enough of it was superb for me to give it 5 stars. Had I waited as long as people typically do to eat here, I likely would have a less glowing opinion of it.

As in the chicken is brought out in pot where it was cooked, soaking in its own juices, with no added spices at all. The chicken tastes like chicken. And the salad. Nothing on the menu looked appetizing to me, so I figured I get the cheapest thing, which was a 8 dollar organic salad. It was literally a plate of lettuce, which the tiniest pinch of vingarette. It was terrible. Why would you say its a salad if it only has lettuce? That just lettuce. Humor me with a onion or something, but nope just lettuce, and not even romaine, it was like garden fresh you get at Jewel. The dessert was disappointing. It wasn't bad, but the whole thing behind gastro pub is that they take simple everyday recipes and put a twist on it that in practice is suppose to be different and TASTY.

Featuring locally sourced nose-to-tail American cuisine. There is also a vast adult beverage menu with several house specialties (I really enjoyed the hot Yuzu Toddy) and a great beer list along with lots of wines and spirits. Longman & Eagle unfortunately does not take reservations so my advice is to come early as this is an extremely popular venue; my friend and I arrived a little before 6:00pm on a Thursday night and managed to score one of the last remaining two tops before the evening rush commenced. By the time we received our amuse bouche there was already a small crowd of people standing near the bar eagerly awaiting their turn. The ambiance is that of an upscale pub but is a tad on the loud side and tables are quite close together. Service is attentive and professional but our server was all about business rather than personable. The pace of the meal was somewhat faster than I had anticipated (especially considering how full they were), but it did not feel at all rushed.The menu at Longman & Eagle frequently changes based on what fresh ingredients can be procured. The menu is divided up until a few sections: Bar snacks, Small Plates, Salads and Sandwiches and Entrees (there is a sample menu online that provides a pretty good idea of what to expect but my buddy was sad that the seared duck testicles on the online menu were not available in house tonight). My friend and I split a bar snack and two small plates and each had our own entree. Our bar snack (buffalo sweetbreads) was small, but very tasty. It consisted of four pieces of battered sweetbreads coated with hot sauce made to resemble buffalo wings. For the small plates we partook in the roasted bone marrow with a very nice red onion jam and a pig face dish made to resemble a Reuben sandwich (this was outstanding). My entree was a leg of venison in a gingerbread sauce (I am a big fan of having a sweet component to savory foods). This was good as well, but the appetizers I enjoyed a tad more than the entree; my friend opted for a bacon rapped rabbit which he seemed to really enjoy. While the appetizers were a tad on the small size, the entrees were fairly generous. There were a handful of \"safe\" foods (as well as a small vegetarian menu) for those not into eating odd animal parts (or \"scary\" foods as my wife calls them). The dessert was possibly the best part of the evening and was a fun dish with lots of components (we both ordered the same dessert). It had a shot glass filled with a popcorn mousse, a cooked spiced apple, a shortbread cookie and a generous scoop of bacon ice cream completed with some maple powder. Excellent dessert and combined with the entrees and starters this was the perfect sized meal to leave satisfied but not uncomfortable. While I wish Longman & Eagle took reservations, so long as you come early (and opt for a weeknight) one can avoid the wait). There is plenty of parking nearby as well as a blue line el stop across the street. While Longman & Eagle is not quite as good an overall experience as most of the other Michelin starred venues I have had the pleasure of frequenting, the food is a real good value and the menu interesting enough I would definitely like to return here. The adult beverages are also quite favorably priced (most cocktails are just $8 and large glasses of craft beer run $6 to $7). Our tab for the evening (three small dishes, two entrees, two desserts, two beers, two cocktails and a coffee) came to $75 per/person before gratuity.

I have a 16 month old child and I don't go out to eat very much anymore but ate at L&E a few months ago while out with a friend for his birthday. Since that night I have been telling my wife about the burger at L&E. Today I stopped in around 4:15 PM to order a couple of burgers to take home. The hostess told me that the kitchen didn't open until 5 PM and I should be able to order my food then, I took a menu and came back at 5. When we returned we were told that they were too busy to make an order for take out at that time. I don't have a problem with them not offering take out (even if it is silly to deny business to people who can't or won't eat in), I have a problem with them making the rules up as they go. I was there 5 minutes after the kitchen opened and they were too busy to make a couple of burgers? Really? So we took our money to Dunlay's on the Square located a block away who offer a killer turkey burger, and it was delicious. Maybe I'll go back to L&E in 6 or 7 years when the kids are grown up and I can actually sit down and enjoy a meal uninterrupted.

Wish I could give 2.5 stars to reflect my ambivalence. First with the positives. Great location in Logan Square just steps away from the blue line. Nothing to sneeze at when you're coming from the south side to try out a new restaurant. Service was knowledgeable and friendly (I'm giving her a pass that she hit on my hubs - he is extremely cute after all...) The whiskey selection is very impressive, not just extensive but top-shelf selections. For cocktails I had the Full House, which combined Laird's applejack with benedictine, yellow chartreuse, and bitters. Hubs had the Ringer. What we love most about whiskey cocktails is how unassuming they are. They're not boisterous or pretentious, just simple drinks highlighting the whiskey in a way that says, \"I have nothing to prove.\" I also appreciated the concept of rooms on top of the restaurant that travelers can stay in on the cheap. Almost seemed like a reversal of the usual concept: 1. hotel 2. restaurant. L&E reverses this: the hotel rooms (only 6 of them) are subordinated to the restaurant. Very cool.So those were the positives. Now for the negatives: the food was absurdly and shamelessly rich and fattening. Part of the problem is that I determined beforehand I was going to order whatever my server recommended as the \"best\" which ending up leading to absolute chaos - and by that I mean lipid overload in my poor, unsuspecting stomach. It wasn't just the recommendations, though, since I tried to find an item - something, anything - fresh on the menu to balance all the heaviness and was unfortunately unable to do so. My wild boar sloppy joe was tasty but left me feeling physically ill, especially when coupled with the \"beef fat\" fries (to me, \"beef fat\" anything sounds like a bad idea) that tasted exactly like fast food fries. Ugh. What I did next must have been prompted by momentary demon possession or perhaps a strange alignment of the planets at the very moment my server asked, \"Would you like any dessert?\" to which I replied, \"Yes, I'll have the gruyere stuffed donuts served with side of whipped goat cheese.\" Yeah, that was an awesome idea. I felt sick for two days following this experience. I fasted the day after - eating only a small salad and a bit of plain oatmeal - and ate only slightly more the next day. I really hope L&E is not a reflection of the direction of foodie/restaurant trends, but unfortunately I have noticed a similar backlash-against-health at other supposedly \"hip and trendy\" new restaurants. Overall this experience reminded me that trends can be terrible and even downright stupid.

The meal I was lucky enough to have definitely ranks in my top 5 meals in my life, possibly stealing a second spot. I must warn you, though, the atmosphere is not for everyone. The ambience and style, accurately described as \"hipster\" on yelp, was perfect for me as a young adult, but not so much for my 70-year old grandfather. Surprisingly (despite the fact that it was a Thursday night), we were seated after a quick 10 minute wait (Longman doesn't accept reservations). Amongst the four of us, we ordered three dishes to start. The first was crustini with three cheeses, the second was beef meatballs with creamy polenta, and the last dish was tete de cochon. I have had variations of these dishes at restaurants such as the Purple Pig and Girl and the Goat, and I have to say that Jared Wentworth's version of the above dishes stole the show in comparison to the other two venues. My favorite had to be the tete de cochon, despite the fact that the Slagel Family Farm meatballs were the best meatballs I have ever had.For my entr\u00e9e, I went with the online buzz consensus of ordering the pork belly, and I must say, my expectations were exceeded tenfold. A hearty portion that filled me up, the pork belly was more meat than fat and was cooked to perfection in comparison to the copious amounts of pork belly I have had in my life. As if the divine pork belly was not enough, the butternut risotto performed as an excellent sidekick. New to the risotto game, Longman and Eagle's was better than other Chicago spots I have been to, including the former Michelin Star holder Sixteen. It was also beautifully paired in terms of flavor with the pork belly.My dining peers ordered pork cheek, wild boar sloppy joe, and steak. I was fortunate enough to try the steak, which was cooked amazingly well, and also the beef fat fries paired with the wild boar sloppy joe, which rivaled Stephanie Izard's ham frites.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate pate, which was delicious, but a bit underwhelming in comparison to the quality of the dinner. This is the only problem I have when comparing Izard's joint with Wentworth's.

I love the drink program, especially the whiskey selection, and I enjoy the concept and atmosphere. It's a perfect fit for the neighborhood - a little rough around the edges but sophisticated and comfortable at the same time. I appreciate the no reservation system but I hate it when they need the entire party there just to start the clock - that seems a bit unfair - and even though we waited a solid 45 minutes on a weeknight I could have sworn other parties got seated before us that shouldn't have (taking care of friends maybe?). Lastly, when the bill arrives you definitely remember you're at a Michelin Starred restaurant because they can charge like one. I didn't find the particularly good ($13-16 small plates, entrees $22 +). Bottom line, it's a cool spot with unique characteristics serving creative cuisine, but with a confusing front of house, average tasting food and an expensive bill - I wonder when I'll be back next. We started aggressively with the Buffalo sweetbreads - a play on buffalo wings - that was interesting and had a nice sauce and no hint of sweetbreads really, as well as the order of meatballs. I liked the meatball sauce a lot and the meat itself was fine, but I don't like how small the portion is (4 small meatballs I think for $6). Our main course consisted of the following: Erica went with the Slow Roasted Cauliflower served on Beluga Lentils with Carmelized Onions and other veggies, Kate ordered the Seared Maine Day Boat Scallops (with Black Truffle Cream of Wheat, Beech Mushrooms, Pickled Ramp Bulbs, Pea Shoots, Citrus Emulsion), Brad had the best dish of Crispy Confit of Pork Belly (with Butternut Risotto, Klug Farm Apples, Squash, Soy Chestnut Broth) and I mixed and matched Organic Werp Farm Greens with the English Pea Agnolotti.Erica and I were both underwhelmed with our vegetarian dominant dishes and even preferred the roasted cauliflower dish from Bite Cafe much more. My salad was tasty salad but the agnolotti was small and didn't do a lot to excite me. Kate's scallops look huge and well cooked, no complaints from her, and Brad's pork belly was the winner with a very tasty butternut risotto.

pretzel with Welsh rarebit and olives, were a solid beginning to the night. \u00a0The olives were surprisingly unsalty (in a good way) and the Welsh rarebit surprisingly contained no rabbit (bad joke). \u00a0I love a good pretzel with cheese sauce and this was a substantial improvement over the normal ballpark fare. \u00a0Once we were seated, we started with three appetizers: the Ipswich clam belly sandwich, the pumpkin angolotti, and the meatballs. \u00a0While I generally don't care for savory things involving squash/pumpkin, the agnolotti were actually quite tasty. \u00a0I didn't get much of the foie gras that was supposed to be shaved on top but overall quite good. \u00a0The meatballs and the clam belly sandwich were both awesome. \u00a0The meatballs were tiny but packed a huge punch of flavor and the polenta/sauce/fonduta/pesto combo was a perfect compliment. \u00a0I love that places around here are starting to put Ipswich clam bellies on the menu more and these were worth it. \u00a0The celery root remoulade was delicious. \u00a0I had been eying the wild boar sloppy joe during my standard pre-meal online menu review and had a hard time looking at any other entree. \u00a0I was not sorry I ordered it -

So that's the food - 4.5 to 5 stars. \u00a0Now for the service...Like I said, everything started out well. \u00a0The first problem occurred once our marrow bones came out. \u00a0My friend and I were both mixing the red onion jam into the marrow while still in the bone. \u00a0Our server came over with a \"helpful\" tip: did you know that marrow bones have holes on both sides? \u00a0And that everything would work out way better if we were to just push it through out onto our plate and mix it there? \u00a0And that he has a lot of experience with these sorts of things, so...? \u00a0The condescension was awesome! \u00a0Dear server whose name I have already blocked from my memory: a) yes, I'm well aware that marrow bones have holes on either side b) the bone was friggin HOT. \u00a0I didn't exactly want to pick it up and give myself second degree burns while I scraped all of the fatty goodness out from the inside walls c) i'm glad you have experience eating bone marrow. \u00a0me too.The second problem happened when I decided to order some bourbon. \u00a0I like bourbon. \u00a0I LOVE bourbon. \u00a0I grew up in KY, where they basically mainline it into you from infancy. \u00a0When I looked at the menu online before my trip to Chicago, I was outrageously excited to see that they had Pappy Van Winkle 20 and 23 year on their whiskey menu. \u00a0It's expensive, but I wanted a treat. \u00a0Unfortunately, they didn't have it on their menu once we arrived. \u00a0No problem; there were a ton of other awesome things to choose from. \u00a0I decided on the Van Winkle Special reserve12 year. \u00a0When I ordered it, I said \"Pappy Van Winkle special reserve 12 year\" by mistake, just because I had Pappy on my mind. \u00a0About five minutes go by, and he comes back, asking me to point to the item I wanted on the drink menu, because they don't know what I'm talking about. \u00a0Keep in mind that there is no Pappy Van Winkle, no Old Rip Van Winkle, no Van Winkle anything else on the menu. \u00a0By the power of deductive reasoning and all that is logical and good, shouldn't one assume that I ordered the Van Winkle? \u00a0I get maybe coming back to double check that's what I meant, but to go through the whole \"point to it on the menu\" and then lecture me about how they're not the same thing (yes - LECTURE ME about how \"there are about a million different kinds\" of Van Winkle and they're not at all the same) just seems excessive. \u00a0I like to learn new things about my food and drinks, but I don't like to be talked down to. \u00a0The best part was when he had to come back and tell me that they didn't have any Van Winkle left. \u00a0That ruled. \u00a0So moral of the Longman & Eagle story: food is good - great, even - but watch out for the awesome condescending servers who obviously know more (and are cooler) than you.", "Date": "2011-03-07", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Jessica M.", "ReviewID": "xdrhgjRJZkMejkRelEsbyQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There's a hotel here.

Overall the experiences have been good, but not excellent. I think the menu is interesting and innovative and the space is beautiful, but I think they take themselves a bit too seriously for what they truly offer. Because of that, they can really disappoint sometimes - at least they did for me.I have a few complaints about my most recent visit. My husband and I arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and were asked to wait at the bar for the other two members of our party. We each ordered one of their specialty cocktails - last time our cocktails were very good. The bartender began to put together our drinks but couldn't find the flavored simple syrups needed to make them. She asked another bartender if he had made them. Nope. She looked around a bit more and asked another employee. He said that she would have to make them. Then she proceeded to finish our specialty drinks, clearly without all of their ingredients, but said nothing. We were bummed and the drinks were not very interesting without the unique syrups.Once our friends arrived and we were seated, we picked two apps to share for the table and ordered more drinks. We were really looking forward to a leisurely dinner with our friends and lots of food and wine. Our server politely told us that they only took complete orders (no apps on their own) so that the kitchen could time everything perfectly for us. Okay, no problem. We like perfect timing! Well, we did not receive our apps first. And our server could not have missed the issue, but said nothing as he stood over us while our salads were delivered. The salads were followed by our apps about 5 minutes later, followed by our entrees about 5 minutes after that. We all had a good laugh about the \"timing\" thing, but overall were disappointed with the service and felt rushed to get through our meal. Of all the \"rules\" at a restaurant, I think the \"order all at once\" rule is only reasonable if the restaurant can make it work correctly. And if it fails, they should definitely say something.", "Date": "2010-11-16", "Author_Location": ""}, {"Author": "Joe F.", "ReviewID": "Ify3yI2cFAZLowqOp10a3g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been frequenting Longman & Eagle for quite some time now, and the food has always been consistently fantastic. However, I've noticed quite a decline in the service over my past three visits, and I hope the trend does not continue. A few friends and I went there last night for dinner. At first, things seemed okay, we all had ordered drinks, and two out of three arrived within moments of ordering. There was a delay in one drink, but it was an unusual cocktail and our server explained that there was a backup at the bar, which is understandable, but the 15-20 minute wait for the drink to come out after our server had apologized is not.After my friend received her drink, more problems began. We placed our starter and entree orders.Our first appetizer, the mallard pate, came out at a timely manner after the amuse. The second appetizer, the duck rillettes, did not come out at all, however. Our food runner, 20+ minutes later then brought out two correct entrees, and a pork cheek small plate which was actually supposed to be a pork shank entree. She apologized for the lack of rillettes and for the pork cheek. I in no way was being difficult about the slow timing, or the missing and miscommunicated orders, but our server came back to the table with a clearly unhappy expression, and almost angry tone of voice saying \"You wanted the shank? Because you ordered the pork cheek. Just checking\".In the event that it was my fault, and it wasn't a miscommunication, which I assumed it was, (and immediately forgave it, assuming it was just a miscommunication) because it could be hard to hear the difference between cheek and shank, you do not correct a client, especially in the manner that she did, especially to one that's not even giving a hard time about the mishap.The FOH manager came to our table and apologized for the misunderstanding, and comp'd the duck rillettes, which was nice. The evening also seemed to improve after we had finished our entrees. Dessert came out on time, and our server had returned to the attentive, helpful server attitude she had when she began to serve our table.All in all, Longman & Eagle is still a great place to go, and I still will recommend this place to friends, but I sincerely hope that the service improves back to the level that it once was.", "Date": "2010-11-29", "Author_Location": "Skokie, IL"}, {"Author": "Alec B.", "ReviewID": "FRnL9NSYa-Taga3zm9mCow", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wild boar sloppy joe's are amazing, but this place is way too trendy and crowded to be worth the fight.", "Date": "2011-03-03", "Author_Location": "Newport, RI"}, {"Author": "Erin B.", "ReviewID": "YKIBwQ92hOJXT5AZZPOr1w", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had the burger and was deeeelish, but i give it three stars because I'm not too sure it was worth the 2.5 hour wait.

I have a major sweet tooth and have the dessert every time, but for some reason the desserts don't impress me. The main courses on the other hand make up for the desserts. RESERVATIONS. They don't take any. This is problematic. The reason it is problematic is because the hostess is unable to give an accurate estimate of the wait time. I get that it is hard to estimate table turnover times, but when you are told 45 minutes and it turns into 2 hours I have a problem. One of these times the hostess sent over a complimentary cheese plate and frog legs for us to enjoy when we were seated at our table, but this would have been a nice gesture to do when we were waiting for our table for 2+ hours.

I'm not hip, but I really enjoy surrounding myself with tons of hipsters (hence being an English major).

You could have seen through my napkin from all the grease that I wiped on it. I have never experienced anything like it, and I've eaten some greasygreasy pizza. The sandwich came with a potato terrine which I think had some form of duck fat or meat in it.. That made me sad because I don't like duck.

I was a little apprehensive because I really had no idea what we were in for. The hostesses were immediately attentive and informed us that there would be a 10 minute wait. We were able to get stools at the bar , where the mixologist wasted no time to acknowledge us and provide the extensive cocktail & whiskey list. He asked us what we were in the mood for , I basically said something with a white tequila that is summery and effervescent. I didn't hear what my partner said but I ended up with a drink called \"The Order of the Red Eagle\"made with Blanco Tequila, R&W Orchard Pear, Fresh Lime, Peychauds, Ginger Beer and my partner received \"The Avalon\" which is a rum based drink with an orange rind in the glass I \u00a0can't remember the rest of the ingredients. However what I can tell you is that the drinks were expertly prepared and \u00a0an explosion of flavor and refreshment , we were truly cocktail-ing! At this point pleasantly imbibing ,I took a look around the the restaurant to check out the scene. it's mostly 20-30 something's crowd but very chill and easy going, seems like \u00a0a lot of neighborhood folks. The restaurant decor is mostly all wooden motifs and it almost felt reminiscent of an urban saloon but definitely with a huge helping of understated sophistication. Our hostess brought us out to a patio table. At this point the sun had set.The patio is warmly lit and they burn lovely incense, which created a nice relaxed vibe and it felt intimate. For appetizers we order the \"House Marinated Olives\" and the \"Slagel Family Farms Meatballs\"made with Creamy polenta, parsley pesto, fonduta. The olives were perfectly flavorful but the meatballs and that polenta was every reason to abuse the cardinal sin of gluttony. The meatballs were tender and the creaminess and flavor of the fonduta was just indulgent in an excellent way. For an entree' I had the Pan Roasted Walleye (maine lobster, potato gnocchi, radish, carrot, salt roasted beets, foraged mushrooms, warm porcini vinaigrette) and my partner had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe. The flavor for my entree is only matched by it's presentation. It was so tender saucy and delicious. My partners Sloppy Joe was made with fall apart delicious pork and crunchy yummy fries. The server was very attentive and because of that had several more \"Order of the Eagle\". We never felt rushed or ignored and hanging out in the patio was so relaxing and Logan Square really comes alive in the dark therefore the people watching is fun.

We had to check out a michelin star restaurant and this one looked the most inviting. Glad we picked longman because it was awesome.To start, they had a great beer selection. All your domestic favorites, a good selection of micro brews and locals, and an import list that will make any beer fan giddy. My favorites are the begian brews so I had a la chouffe and a delirium. Served in an appropriate glass and it hit the spot. Next, the food. For appetizers we had the foie gras, bone marrow, and the buffalo sweetbreads. If you dont know what a sweetbread is, dont ask, just eat it, its delicious. If you know what it is, then this was a great twist on a classic. The bone marrow was served with some bread and a spoon. Very well cooked and flavorful. Its a little messy so utilize your manners and a napkin. The foie gras was the best foie I ever had. prepared with a couple relishes and toppings and served over a mini waffle with a sprinkle of salt on top. Highly recommend all the above (although menu is seasonal) On to the entrees. My friends all enjoyed their dishes. I had the duck three ways. It was duck breast over duck leg confit with a foie gras preparation on the side. all this was served with a delicious sauce and appropriately placed veggies and accoutrements. The duck was perfectly prepared in each presentation and very reasonably priced considering I was basically getting a half duck and foie gras. We were stuffed by the end of the night but ordered a dessert to share anyway. It was an interesting sounding dessert. A olive oil cake with a pistachio sauce served with ice cream and a grilled peach (i think it was a peach). Anyway, the dessert was very good, I was full so I didnt savor it as much as I could have if I was a little hungry. If you have a sweet tooth, maybe slow down on the apps to save room for dessert.The waitstaff was awesome. The waiter appeared to have tried everything on the menu and offered way more information and suggestions than I thought possible. He was overly accommodating and helpful.

We were most interested in the 'plates' section of the menu. The lineup:- Amuse: I honestly do not remember what we had. It was white with green accents, and unmemorable.- Pear Salad: Our waitress told us that the sandwiches were a good portion size, compared to the rest of the menu, so I was surprised that our pear salad was also 'normal' sized. The salad was light and refreshing. I'm used to pear slices in pear salads - this was more of a chunky puree.- Seared Maine Scallop with braised oxtails, potato gnocchi, fontina fonduta. Pretty good. The flavors mixed well. Just note that it is a TINY portion for twelve dollars.- Potato Agnolotti escargots, wild mushrooms, bordelaise sauce, cured foie gras. The sides were too salty. - Smoked Sweetbreads. I've realized that I only like sweetbreads when they are fried. I cannot appreciate the smokiness. This was also a small portion.- Roasted Bone Marrow. Really good. Very decent portion. We asked for extra bread and they accommodated. - Pork Belly Confit with pumpkin risotto, chestnuts, apple, soy-caramel broth. This was awesome and my favorite item of the evening. The description says it all.I also had the Last Word cocktail (Tanqueray gin, Luxardo maraschino liqueur, Green Chartreuse and lime juice).

Turns out it was (I only waited for 20-30 min), so that's good!I have to say, I loved everything I ordered! This place is so amazing that I had to go back the following weekend for brunch, again! I went with my sister during my first brunch visit. I had the Peeky Toe Crab Benedict. This was incredible! The Hollandaise sauce was like no other! The eggs were so light and not greasy at all. The crab meat tasted so fresh. The dehyrated bacon was phenomenal. It tasted so sweet and almost caramelized. The breakfasts come with a side of mixed green or potatoes. I opted for the mixed green. They were decadent. I loved the dressing! It was one of the best salads I've ever had. My sister had the Market Scramble. From the little bite that I had I thought it was great. Again, not greasy which is surprising for an egg breakfast. She ordered it w/ the side of potatoes and they were incredible. The following weekend I went with my boyfriend for brunch. Since I loved what I got the previous weekend I decided to get it again! Everything, like last time, was great with the exception for the mixed greens. They were not only wilted but they barely had any of that delicious dressing on them. My boyfriend had the PBR Breakfast. It came with a cold-can of PBR and two eggs any style. He got them over-medium and said that it was the best over-medium egg -- it wasn't too over or under done, a major feat in his eyes. It also came w/ bacon or house-made sausage. He ordered the sausage and being a self-proclaimed sausage connoisseur he said it was hands down the best he ever had. Obviously after hearing that I had to have a bite and I have to say that I agree w/ him (and I don't even like sausage!) It was tangy yet sweet and cooked to perfection. He ordered his breakfast w/ the side of potatoes. They were as good as I remembered them from last weekend. Since he loves bacon he also added a side of it to his order. He said it was the best bacon he ever had so, I had to try some, too. We loved that it had a smokey flavor (I've never tried bacon that tasted like that) and, like everything else, I was impressed that it wasn't greasy. We'll definitely be back!

They even have rooms upstairs.All in all the prices were a touch more than I'd normally spend, but then this is not a normal restaurant. We all left feeling full and I will definitely be back. We were lucky because we got here at 5 on a Sunday, and they DON'T accept reservations??????, but by the time we left, this place was jumpin'.", "Date": "2011-10-05", "Author_Location": "East Village, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Esther S.", "ReviewID": "q5gJkmmnS56_WCP28lWnNg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I went back for brunch.

I also had the Pigs Head plate which was EXCELLENT, so unlike anything i've had before. \u00a0I'm not really even sure what they did, I guess they took all the meat from the head, shredded it and wrapped it in some sort of fatty goodness then fried it?

After a long while picking and choosing places, I suggested us to go to Owen and Engine. We love that place. But once we got there, we couldn't find parking. The boyfriend hates driving around to find a parking spot.. So.. what to do... what to do... Then, it hit me... I suggested us to go to Longman and Eagle. Parking? not a problem. There a huge parking lot across the street.I've been to L&E once, about a year ago for drinks, leaving the place, wasted. But, I remembered everything being so good and tasty. Therefore I was super excited to come in for the second time, even though i was a little nervous about the wait. But to my surprise, the wait was only 20 minutes, not even!!!! While we were waiting, my boyfriend bought us each some whiskey cocktails to try. He had the January V and I had the Shrubbery. YUMMMMNESSS!!! I liked my drink better, it's sweet and sour, definitely tasty. His drink was a lot heavier and minty. But, it was perfect to his liking. Not too long after, the friendly host came to sit us.Dinner time!!! Our server came to greet us. He was very friendly and professional. He recommended us to try the small plates and to share the entree. And that's exactly what we did; we ordered the Tartare that came with rye toasts which was very good. Pastrami Spiced Pig Head that was served with Sauerkraut Gnocchi was amazing!!! That was my favorite. It was super delicious. My boyfriend was giving me a funny look when I mentioned that we have to try that, good thing I didin't listen to him and ordered it anyways because it was amazing!!! We also had the Kentucky Fried Quail that came with Foie Gras Corn Bread. Ohhh my Lord!!! It was delicious!!! Just thinking about those two dishes makes me hungry for L&E again. Lastly, we had the Deconstructed Rabbit Pot Pie, which was good but not my favorite. However, the boyfriend finished every last bits of it. I stayed with my Shrubbery drink while my boyfriend ordered one of his favorite, the Old Fashioned, which was very strong and sharp and really good.And here comes the entree... The probably 5 pounds pork shank. I saw it coming from a distance and I knew it was ours, i was like \"holy cannolli!!!\" It was huge!!! We took a few bites and were already full. It was delicious. We took it home with us and ate it for the next 2 days. Still delicious!!! And for dessert, we had the Dark Chocolate Crispy Fernet Pave, Malt Gelato, Caramel Pudding. That was also very good. Then the bill came, it came up to $130 something. It was pretty pricey but to really think about it... We had at least 4 drinks, 4 appropriate sized small plates, a giant entree and a dessert??!?!?!! I think that wasn't that bad. I was also very impressed on all the servers. They definitely know their food and drinks. Our waiter recommendations were right on the spot and the rest of the servers who came to dropped off the plates for us explained everything in details what is in that plate.It can get really loud there and the waiting can get a little inconvenience since there was no waiting room and everyone just piled up around the bar area, making the entrance is a little inconvenience.The front dining room is pretty small and crammed, so, you have to walk through carefully in the dark while people are eating.

As we slowly caffeinated ourselves I took in the similarly hip, down-to-earth and amazingly branded decor as I had I experienced upstairs as a guest in their Inn. A vintage juke box in the corner plays a mix of classic honky-tonk and low-key indie music, the impressive whiskey (etc) selection covered one entire wall, and all of the worn and natural wood played well off of the subtle golds and black throughout. The first time I ate here I had the sunny side duck egg hash with incredibly moist duck confit, yukon gold potatoes, spring onions, and a black truffle vinaigrette turned out to be one of the greatest meals of my life. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the hash was bursting with flavor, very down-home yet sophisticated and well thought out. This was refined comfort food as its best.

I know that we are all excited to have a new spot in Logan Square but there are some issues to address here. I will be upfront and say that I did not eat when I was here but that was mostly due to the fact that there were few if any items that I could eat. I looked and looked at the menu and I believe that there were 3 maybe 4 items on the entire menu that didn't include beef or pork. The scallops had beef, one salad was made with a bacon dressing, the list continues. If you eat anything and everything and could care less about the number of calories, grams of fat and your cholesterol level then you should be happy here. The food did look and smell delicious but I am really tired of places that serve pork with their pork. Impress me with something that I've never heard of before or tasted together. Besides that the bar is cool and old fashioned. The crowd on a Wednesday night was very Logan Square hipster. And it was pretty packed at 7pm when I got there. It thinned out a bit by 8:30. I can't even imagine how packed this place must get on the weekends. It was a typical loud bar which also might not be ideal for a nice dinner out. The staff was very nice and helpful. The beer list was great and the whiskey list is phenomenal. They did have a cool old juke box which had some good tunes on it. I know there was music playing when I was there but I couldn't tell you what it was. My only other complaint was that the bathrooms were a bit dirtier than I would expect. I hope that is something that they fix quickly. I will go back sometime to try one of the few items on the menu that I can eat. Until then I can't give it a completely fair review.

I went here with my bro on a Friday night . . . you know, two dudes out on the town. \u00a0We arrived at 7:15 pm, and we were told the wait was an hour and a half (they don't take reservations). \u00a0This wasn't surprising as we had been warned by other Yelpers. \u00a0We walked over to the pizza place around the corner, and we had a few beers. \u00a0It seems that the pizza place gets a significant amount of business from L&E overflow. \u00a0At 8:45 pm on the dot, we received a call from the hostess (who was quite friendly) telling us that our table was available. \u00a0As we walked to our table, I could see that L&E faithfully observes many of the gastropub tropes: lots of wood, small space, low overhead lighting with puny- table-candle task lighting, a tiny open kitchen, a quirky signature decorative item (arrows in glass vases on built-in wall shelves). \u00a0It was fine, but I've been to other places with a similar aesthetic that did a better job of capturing the casual and rustic elegance that I think L&E is striving for (i.e., the Spotted Pig and the Hopleaf). \u00a0 Our server, a youngish, hipsterish guy, was friendly and welcoming. \u00a0We received our drinks promptly. \u00a0Because I had previously had a few beers and was already somewhat inebriated, I elected not to order a drinking whisky or a beer. \u00a0Instead, I got a cherry cola, and the bro got a birch beer - both were pretty good.Our meal was kicked off by a sample size of white truffle risotto. \u00a0Tasty but nothing special. \u00a0We ordered two starters - the scallops with oxtail and truffle gnocchi and the veal heart. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0The scallops were cooked well, and I was surprised that their flavors were nicely complemented by the oxtail (which was served pulled meat style). \u00a0The veal heart was cut up into little cubes and served along with a tasty long-ravioli-type pasta stuffed with a delicious gravy like substance. \u00a0The veal heart was soft and a little creepy but tasty, and the pasta thingy was really tasty. For entrees, I ordered the pork belly and the bro ordered basically a big plate of assorted protein (two kinds of stewed meats, foie gras, bone marrow). \u00a0My pork belly was good, but it was nothing special. \u00a0It was served on a bed of risotto and \u00a0topped off with chestnuts; it tasted a lot like a Korean dish called kalbi jim, which is essentially stewed short ribs in a somewhat sweetish soy-based marinade. \u00a0The bro's entree was unimpressive. \u00a0The stewed meats were too soft and lacked character. \u00a0There was only a tiny amount of bone marrow - the bro's plate had a hollowed out bone filled with mashed potatoes, and the bone marrow was just two small cubes atop of the potatoes. \u00a0The bone marrow wasn't even that good. \u00a0The cubes were white and tasted kind of like fat. \u00a0Apparently, some of the bone marrow had been whipped into the potatoes, but that seems like a strange choice as the potatoes, while good, were not especially marrow-tasting. \u00a0The foie gras was the only part of his dish that we liked. \u00a0But we agreed that his dish, which was a not inexpensive $29, was pretty mediocre.Overall, I came to L&E really psyched, and I left stuffed, underwhelmed, and with a much lighter wallet.

If I had only ordered this dish I would have left happy, if hungry and feeling a touch overcharged (at 10 dollars it certainly wasn't cheap).Sadly, the rest of the meal went severely awry. \u00a0My boyfriend's kobe burger was ordered medium rare and delivered medium well. \u00a0For a restaurant that prides itself on meat, this is an error of grand proportion. \u00a0To me, cooking a burger close to well done is the fastest way to ruin good meat so I feel it's not fair to rate the burger itself, except to say it was way oversalted (more on that later). \u00a0Another time we would have asked the restaurant to correct the mistake, but other aspects of our meal were so off and we were so tired that we didn't bother. \u00a0From the deft handling of the soup I would have expected a fluffy, rich brandade, but the texture was instead both liquid and lumpy. \u00a0The brandade was of course salty (it's made from potatoes and salt cod) and it ranks among my favorite things to eat in general - I even feel it's health-restoring when prepared correctly. \u00a0But this one was way too salty - the salt flavor overwhelmed the flavor of the dish, as if the cod hadn't been soaked enough. \u00a0It was basically inedible.The kicker to the meal, though, was the beef fat fries, which I hoped would save us from our lackluster burger and gloopy brandade. \u00a0You can always depend on fries when everything else is wrong with a meal, except at Longman and Eagle, where you can't. \u00a0Because of the salt. \u00a0Maybe beef fat fries are wonderful, but I wouldn't know because these fries were saltier than the brandade! \u00a0Saltier than a dish made of salt cod. \u00a0They too were inedible, and I am no enemy to salt.Defeated, or possibly hypertensive from the excessive sodium, we feebly paid our bill and left without complaint. \u00a0I want to be able to give L & E another chance, but I'm too afraid to risk having to decide between elevated blood pressure or unfulfilled hunger during my meal. \u00a0Perhaps it was an off night, but our meal was so incredibly misguided that I don't think I can give them another chance, except for perhaps conducting some clandestine espionage over a dimly-lit whiskey flight. \u00a0After all, spies never eat, do they? \u00a0However, if you routinely suffer from excessively low blood pressure and want to eat a meal comprised of salt, salt, and salt, I highly recommend L&E, it could be lifesaving.", "Date": "2010-05-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "daniel a.", "ReviewID": "qSYU__-MQ94iqz65epPpew", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Decent sized place with a long bar front, separate back seating, gets pretty noisy, young crowd in logan square and they have Maudite beer! \u00a0good stuff to go with some unique dishes. \u00a0They have rooms available upstairs? \u00a0Thats what I've heard anyway. \u00a0Good for dates with friends or date dates.", "Date": "2010-05-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sivan H.", "ReviewID": "iuHyw4ARgjnFAsqKgt3Pgg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place makes me wish I lived in Chicago (well, almost.)

Although I only got the fluke and I can't say if the burgers are any good, I can't imagine the same people that made that fluke could screw up a burger, and one could conceivably have a great meal here for less than the price of a shitty 3D movie.As trite as it sounds, it was truly the best meal I've had in a long time.

Sweet, refreshing, and packed a fair kick. Also, my friend ordered a hot toddy and it was unexpectedly delicious. They have a decent beer list and a lot of fairly cheep whisky.My female friend and I shared: scallops with braised oxtail and truffle gnocchi, buffalo frog legs with aerated blue cheese, lobster parfait with bacon, and tete du cuchon with fried duck's egg and a parsley shallot salad.Our third dinner companion was a vegetarian and had: pretzel with cheese, and butternut squash risotto.Everyone left full and happy.The scallops, the frog legs and aerated blue cheese, and the tete were my favorite on this visit, as they were in the past. I think the other times I dined there the scallops had a different preparation, but were equally delicious. I also loved the marrow on another visit, but my friend and I didn't want to offend our vegetarian companion TOO much (our meat orgy already had 8 different animals represented, and I didn't want to add carving marrow out of actual bone). I wasn't super impressed with the lobster parfait- the lobster meat was a tad tough, and the other main component of the parfait was some sort of sweet root vegetable puree that was a little too sweet and mealy for my taste- something saltier or creamier would have been more pleasant. The only other dish I have ever been disappointed by was some sort of sashimi dish that fell flat both in presentation and in flavor complexity. Other than that, \"snacks,\" small plates, entrees, desserts and cocktails have all been very pleasing.A pleasant surprise from the last visit: an amuse bouche of a creamy soup with crab and smoked bacon.

Sloppy Joe was awesome; the crispy sage they use added great flavor. Kick ass drink menu, $ 3 dollar whiskey shots, and cans of PBR which was cool because I was looking to be cheap but they have a great selection of micro and craft beers if you are looking to step it up. I did break down and try their house Old Fashioned. Specialty cocktails were $8 which I think is very reasonable. Was definitely a really tasty Old Fashioned.

(As an aside, I hated merlot way before it was 'Sideways' chic).There is a reason, though, that I did not deduct a star for the food, which is that the lobster tail was absolutely phenomenal, having been correctly prepared in terms of temperature and managing to have a uniquely rich presentation. \u00a0It was served in broda with three out-of-this world marscapone-filed tortellini. The broth itself had a seafood-vegetable blend, and the stock was fresh, leaving me to believe it was made in-house. \u00a0The fish, other than the bacon-infused beat that was mischaracterized as veggie (hey, I loved the damn thing!), was amazingly fresh for Chicago, having an almost crispy sear and accompanied with fresh veggies. \u00a0Dessert was truly enticing and succulent, as the \"old time sunday\" combined the best fruits with the best chocolate and a simple vanilla ice cream that will return you to your childhood.Overall, I'm going to come back when I'm bored, stay at the inn portion of the establishment, try the hoity-toity \"bar\" menu, and enjoy the whiskey. \u00a0I think that might be its role, and so that's why it gets a second chance, but I'm not pacing to get back there any time soon.", "Date": "2012-08-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Natalie J.", "ReviewID": "3Bh0or0RLZ159RHB-jsTHg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i'm sorry, have i offended you by....placing an order?! \u00a0have i inconvenienced you in some way by....being a customer? \u00a0i'm over the service here. \u00a0this restaurant is run by apathetic kids with bad attitudes and too much flannel. \u00a0i like the physical space, i like the food but the service is ridiculous. \u00a0last time i went for brunch, my waitress looked like she was half asleep and appeared to be completely hassled by our order. and the servers kept walking around, filling up everyone's coffee around us but mine! \u00a0don't these people know who i am?!?!?! \u00a0i'm nobody! \u00a0but i still want good service...", "Date": "2011-03-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Joni C.", "ReviewID": "vvgpFCe6QYaqV3MZEhFKxw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved this restaurant! \u00a0Every bit of this meal was so well planned, so well executed. \u00a0I ate and ate and ate. \u00a0Mouth watering, delectable, fun atmosphere. \u00a0You will enjoy your evening, great date place... come early the word is out about how great it is, and after 6:30 you can wait for 2 hours for a table.", "Date": "2013-05-06", "Author_Location": "IL, IL"}, {"Author": "Emily W.", "ReviewID": "qsZTb-9kf6Hg05itVZvNIA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I doubt there is much to say about Longman that hasn't already been said, but here's my take.

The last time I ate there, I felt that some of their more complex dishes were all over the place, and would be better if they focused on just one ingredient (ex. bacon overpowered the bone marrow; a tiny scoop of drool-worthy gin ice cream wasn't done justice on a dessert with six other ingredients).

I really like the fact that you can sample quality whiskeys for $3 a shot. And if you don't mind doling out some cash, you can try some really fine, rare ones as well. I sampled some High West rye. Very good. The whiskey cocktails are delicious. I had \"The Ringer,\" a mixture of Wild Turkey Rye 101, Cynar, Cherry Heering, and aromatic bitters.

Everything I and my company had was either heavily doused in oil, deep fried in animal fat (a really bad foodie trend, more on that below), loaded with heavy cheese or cream, or completely absent of anything green or fresh. I ordered a burger. It didn't come with any veggies. It was topped with bacon and had kind of a sickening fatty taste. Trying to balance out this meaty excess, I ordered a salad, but it was served with a heavy cream dressing. The desserts were tasty but again equally heavy. I left feeling like I had just eaten at an Applebee's, not what you expect from a trendy restaurant in Logan Square. This sort of \"return to fat\" in a number of popular Chicago restaurants is a troubling trend to me. In the end, beef fat (or duck fat or whatever animal fat) fries are not really different than the kind of stuff served at fast food joints.

I liked that there was an option between potatoes and mixed greens as your side; especially for those of us who are more health conscious. My food was ok. It was good, but I felt like I had to add more salt or hot sauce; the meal was missing something. My companion, on the other hand, raved about her meal. She ordered the crab benedict. We were in disagreement. This place seems like the perfect spot for experimental meat eaters. I've heard people who love the wild boar sloopy joe. As for myself, I'm a recovering vegetarian who just started eating raw fish, so red meat in general, especially boar or deer, is not a favorite.

A fairly nice one. Whenever I go to eat in said restaurant, I get a 50% discount on my meal. At the end of every meal I eat there, I get my check and think to myself \"holy shit, that's all my bill is?\" I've never experienced this feeling in my life, without discount, until tonight at Longman and Eagle. I usually pass by as the place is always packed. Tonight I saw my opportunity to sit at the bar and try the place out so I did. Sat down to a nice greeting. Started out with a great beer from their tap. Got the duck rillettes which were perfect. Had a shot of whiskey recommended by the bartender Nathan, perfect. So perfect that it was hard to believe it was only $3. It finished like a nice wine and had a full palate of flavor. Though served in a shot glass, this was to be enjoyed. I had the kobe burger which was very good. The fries were awesome. The bacon served on the burger was the kind of bacon that makes you believe that there is a God and (s)he too is a fan of smoked pork belly. I was feeling full but I wanted to go a bit further. I asked for an espresso which they were out of, so Nathan got me a 101 proof shot of whiskey that was almost like a digestif. It readied me for a bit more, so I got the sweetbreads. Beautifully prepared, caramelized top, rich and tender on the inside, beautifully accompanied. Finished it off with an after dinner drink in the form of the Yuzu Toddy which was... perfect. In summation, perfect. Everything about it. The service, the food, the drink. I got my bill and spent less than $50, which isn't exactly cheap, but keep in mind that I just ate three courses with a nice beer, 2 whiskeys and an after dinner drink, and hopefully those of you who don't eat in restaurants that end in an \" 's \" (i.e., McDonald's, Arby's, Burger King's) will get my point as to how inexpensive this place really was.

I visited Chicago In October for a wedding, and attended Longman and Eagle for the Rehearsal Dinner. So, my review is limited to our experience at the Rehearsal Dinner... but it was GREAT! Also, I was able to check out the rooms upstairs, which I understand are opening very soon. Because of our large party, we were provided with a fixed menu - each guest was able to select one starter, one entree, and one dessert. I can't remember all of the various options now, but I do recall my food being downright delicious. I started with the Ricotta Gnudi, which was flavorful without being too \"heavy.\" It was just a few little pillows of Gnudi, which was plenty, considering the richness of the food and the upcoming entrees. My entree was the Burger, with aged cheddar and bacon, and served with beef fat fries. I went halfsies on entrees with the guest sitting next to me, who ordered the roasted cauliflower, with lentils, raisins, mango and some other stuff I can't remember. The burger was exactly what I want when I order a burger out: juicy, dripping, 3-napkin type of burger that you gobble up and would never make for yourself at home. Unfortunately, I thought the beef fat fries were unremarkable... by the time my plate got to me (and we waited for the 6 people at our end of the table to be served), they were a little cold and boring. But I like the idea, and think they would be good if served warm. The roasted cauliflower was also prepared well -- if you're a fan of cauliflower, you will love this dish. I was skeptical about the raisins and pickled mango, with lentils, but it worked. In fact, I resolved to add raisins to my next batch of roasted cauliflower at home. The third option for dinner was the half roasted chicken, which other guests seemed pleased with. It was a LOT of food though. Definitely enough for 2 people. For dessert, I think the options were a cheese plate, some sort of chocolate molten cake, and maybe a bread pudding? ( I can't remember the third option). I ordered the cheese plate, but was far too full to eat all of it. It was a nice selection of cheeses, and I would certainly order it again. Overall, I was impressed with the service and attentiveness of the staff. Dealing with large groups is always difficult, and I think they did an excellent job. After dinner, our group migrated to the outdoor beer garden on the side of the building for a little after party.

A rabbit pate followed (it was wrapped with a bit of bacon, no need to say more), prawns and grits (the sauce threw it over the edge) was somehow miraculously balanced. \u00a0Sometimes prawns taste you got them long john silvers, but these were excellent. \u00a0The Tete du Chochon (yes, pigs head, amazing), the overall effect was that of a dried, salty pulled pork, with a poached egg on top. \u00a0Overall, the appetizers and small plates were very rich, full of flavor and beautifully presented. \u00a0The main event: I had the Porchetta with a sweet corn (and bacon) risotto and smoked paprika oil. \u00a0The presentation was nice, the portion appropriate, the porchetta was flavorful, fall apart with a fork tender. \u00a0However, what really made it special was that smoked paprika oil. \u00a0I'm not 100% sure what it is, where to get it or how to make it, but of this I am convinced: I need more of it in my life. \u00a0 My partners in crime had the Seared Tuna; the Flank steak; and the butter-explosion that was the Burger. \u00a0In every case, the dishes showed finesse, great balance, and something special.Since things were going so well, we couldn't help ourselves and got dessert: the Terrine of Madagascar chocolate (or whatever) - was the first disappointment of the night. \u00a0Sadly, it felt a little uninspired, something I could probably get a great Mexican bakery. \u00a0Not bad, mind you, just by no means exceptional. \u00a0Meanwhile, the Charred Olive Pound Cake with warm blue berry compote was a revelation. \u00a0Not just a Mario Battali style cake with olive oil in it--this was green, almost salty, really.. well, olive oil-y. \u00a0The combination was superb. \u00a0The bill. \u00a0 Well, four people, four apps, four entrees, 2 desserts, and probably 6-8 drinks later... it wasn't exactly cheap, but it did feel like a good value for the quality of the food.

The patrons were also friendly, and we made the acquaintance of a lovely couple sitting next to us who were out on their date night. This place is not for everyone.

Also, there were other annoying things. People kept trying to take our plates away when there was food still on there. They kept saying \"take your time,\" but then they'd do it the next course. I get it, you're trying to hustle us out. I've been a server for fourteen years. It was irritating. Another cardinal sin, the server took FOREVER to serve our drinks. You want to keep people happy?

DO NOT BRING A BABY. and if you do--don't bitch about it to the surrounding tables that you're unhappy. this place is not kid friendly. i'm sorry. you're a fairly horrible person if you think this is the newest e_uivalent to the california pi__a kitchen (sorry missing keys--an problem i've been meaning to fix for some time). the food here is delicious. no complaints. the best part of my experience was dipping into the conversation at the next table. a guy on a first date. phoning his friend for wine pairing reccos (read: douche) and being just over the top in general. at the end of the evening we received his check and i was beside myself to find out that his friend had recommended a bottle of \"forlorn hope.\" maybe this is an unspoken friend sort of inside joke in the dating arena. i hope so.", "Date": "2010-08-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sarah O.", "ReviewID": "v8M_1HP3L733yaEJ9WLqUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have spent hundreds of dollars at Longman. \u00a0I have spent countless hours waiting at Longman, squished into their bar, drinking their cocktails.

Two Saturdays ago we went to L&E with another couple for dinner. When we arrived at 7pm, we were quoted a 2 hour wait time. Fine, we have come to expect this, so we went around the corner to another fine Logan Square wine bar to have some noshes and wine while we waited. We returned promptly at 8:50 to check on our table, and at this point, the host quoted us another 1.5 hour wait. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If it was going to be 3 1/2 hours at 7pm, we would have left to go elsewhere at that time (or stayed at Telegraph).
