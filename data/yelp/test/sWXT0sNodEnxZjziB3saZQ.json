I love the ambiance, the space, the food, and the prices. \u00a0The ambiance is dimly lit with lots of seating and multiple floors. \u00a0There are 2 floors and the place is usually filled with people so the atmosphere is loud, but in a good way if you know what I mean. \u00a0It's not too loud and definitely has that Italian noise vibe. \u00a0Moving on to the food. \u00a0The 2 most memorable dishes for me that I got both times I was there are:1) Porcini & Truffle risotto - contains prociini mushrooms and white truffles. \u00a0I can never resist truffles and absolutely love mushrooms. \u00a0The two together are heavenly! \u00a0How do I even start with this dish! \u00a0This is so delicious and just melts in your mouth. \u00a0The aromas you smell when this comes out will just take your breath away. \u00a0This stood out to me among all the appetizers and entrees my friends and I ordered. \u00a0This dish also made me a life-long risotto fan. \u00a0It's not too heavy or cheesy, but perfect.2) Gran Coppa Quartino - one of the best dessert dishes I've ever had. \u00a03 Gelati with roasted hazelnuts and biscotti. \u00a0It's beautiful and \"mouth-wateringly\" delicious. \u00a0I still can't forget it after more than 1 year of not being in Chicago. \u00a0All the desserts are good, but this one looked the best to me. \u00a0It's not too creamy, not too big, beautiful presentation in a clear class cup and colors to all make me have a foodgasm as soon as I see it! \u00a0These 2 dishes come out to be about $30 and it was enough to fill my friend and I both when we split it. \u00a0The prices I feel are very reasonable for the quality. \u00a0The food is fresh when you go in during dinner hours. \u00a0You can get a variety of tapas dishes and share, which means you get to try everything! \u00a0The closing time of 1 am make this ideal for late night bite, but also definitely when you're really hungry. \u00a0Keep in mind you will need to wait about 30-45 minutes if you go in during peak times so I suggest trying to get there early or get a reservation (you can do this on opentable). \u00a0This is one of 2 restaurants in Chicago that I will always return to.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Burlington, VT"}, {"Author": "Magen R.", "ReviewID": "96Mtfjwat5d00cfyBUjXxw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Quartino is a great spot to come with a large group and try a bunch of different things. The atmosphere is very lively and fun so coming with a larger group and being as gregarious as you like works perfectly at Quartino. I came in last night with six family members and we ordered a ton. I'll do my typical tapas like review...Salumeria Tasting: We tried out a bunch of different things. Everything was pretty good but they really skimp on the meat and cheese servings of this dish. Not sure if this is worth the value with that considered. D'Anitra & Sausage Pizze: This was really good. I was skeptical of the duck prosciutto but it was delicious and a great flavor combination as a whole. Not usually a fan of sausage pizza but this was very, very good. All in all I really enjoy how they cook their pizza.Pappardelle \u00a0& Tagliatelle: Both pastas were tasty but nothing special. Polenta Fries: A bit much for me. Was not a fan. White Bean & Garlic Spread: Not a fan of white beans so I probably would not order this one again. Crisp Calamari: Deliciousness in fried form. They do this right! Beef Short Rib: Five stars for this dish. I could've eaten the ENTIRE thing by myself. While I was not in love with everything we ordered I was in love with my experience at Quartino. All of the food was good and the atmosphere was great. I'd highly recommend grabbing an Open Table reservation and hitting this place up for a night of fun and good food.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Charlie W.", "ReviewID": "SliB8aASq3xpjb00ie9wHg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My spouse and I dined with Quartino's for the first time last night and we ABSOLUTELY loved it. I personally liked that they had a variety of price ranges to fit everybody's budget. It's rare to see a place that is accommodating to those with low budgets or high and is delicious regardless.We were given water and fresh soft bread upon sitting down and reviewing the cocktail, beer, and wine list. There were so many options! I ordered the house red wine where it was served in a very generous portion and my spouse had a Peroni beer which was excellent. My wine was $5 for 1/4 liter of the bottle. Peroni was $6 and generally is in a large beer bottle. We decided to order and share the Pasta alla vodka which was served PIPING hot and was excellent. Our only complaint is that we should've gotten our own plates because it was not enough to share as a dinner portion for two(but would be great as a sharing appetizer). It was too good, we scraped the sauce left on the plate up with the bread. So next time I am ordering that for myself.Then we ordered a sausage pizza. We didn't wait long at all and it also was served PIPIN hot and was delicious. We only ate half of it and our server happily boxed the rest up for us to take home. When we received our bill we were shocked. For two entrees and drinks (that we were beyond happy with) only came to be $34.01. Did I mention how difficult it is to find a place that serves great food until 1AM and we got there at 12:30AM? Plus they are open until 2. That's awesome. Plus, for two people drinking and ordering entrees in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night with great service and excellent food... Can't get better than Quartino's.

Unfortunately, the food is only okay. I came here to catch up with a friend for lunch and this is what we tried:1) Fondue - melted cheese and cubed bread pretty much. We didn't realize that's what it would consist of, otherwise I don't think we would've opted for this. Also, the melted cheese was a tad grainy.2) Porcini and truffle risotto - flavors were good but it's missing something to give it a kick, a bit of meet or seafood would've been nice3) Veal milanese - pretty much two veal cutlets, breaded and fried on a bed of arugula. It seemed like it could've been hotter/fresher, and had already cooled down a bit by the time the dish arrived at our table.4) Panino al Gelato Limone - lemon gelato sandwich, this was the best part of the meal! A wonderfully creamy yet refreshing palette cleanser to end the meal.Overall, food was okay and the service was solid. Probably not worth it if it weren't for the lunch special, but I could come back to try more things for lunch in the future -- perhaps we just ordered wrong this time.", "Date": "2014-06-30", "Author_Location": "Columbus, OH"}, {"Author": "Teri Y.", "ReviewID": "iRFvpMMUfG6YTLAVZBAf1Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I can't believe this place has 2000+ reviews and it's definitely nowhere near the top restaurants of Chicago. But when you consider how this menu here is extensive enough to cater to everyone person's fancy (vegetarian, \"meatarian\", pescatarian) and the location is easy enough for tourists to locate, then I guess it makes sense why this place is \"popular\". The food is not mind blowing or phenomenally good. It does not give you a wow factor but it's decent enough.Beef carpaccio:Absolutely bland and tasteless. We've had a lot of carpaccio elsewhere and the slices of rare meat should at least have natural flavor. The slices were also all stuck together as we tried to lift some of the plate.White bean spread:Also absolutely bland. I never salt my food at restaurants but just to experiment if the spread would taste better, I sprinkled some salt and pepper over it. It was a tad bit better.Pappardelle with short rib sauce:Fresh pasta should always have the delicate chewy texture compared to the typical texture of dried pasta like spaghetti and linguine. The pappardelle definitely did not have that chewy texture and tasted more like dried pasta. While the short rib sauce was tasty, but it tasted shallow rather than having depth.Veal osso buco:The meat was extremely tender which is the only positive thing about the dish. The veal itself did not taste like it absorbed any of the sauce. Oddly, the veal had a \"sterile\" taste. It was as if they cooked the veal separately and then the sauce was poured over it.Profiteroles were pretty good but the tiramisu had too much cream.Our dinner there last right reminded us again of why Quartino will never be another Nico Osteria.", "Date": "2014-06-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Janel C.", "ReviewID": "fQKl83FIX02Q2iEpdblNRA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I visit Chicago a lot for various work/personal trips and every time I take to yelp to pick out a few dining options, Quartino's pops up on my list! \u00a0So finally, this past trip, I remembered to make a reservation ahead of time!Since the menu is based on sharable plates, this place is great if you have a larger group. \u00a0It also looked like there were several parties being hosted there, so it looks like they are pretty accommodating as well.We were just a party of 3, but we did manage to try a good amount of food!.Veal Meatball Slider - yum! \u00a0but, it literally is just ONE slider, note there is no \"S\", so order multiples so everyone can try it...or you'll only be getting a bite!Polenta Fries - pretty good and worth a try! \u00a0I would still prefer regular fries, but this is still a good choice! \u00a0Just keep in mind that it's kind of heavy, if you want to try other dishes.Wild Arugala Salad - pretty standard salad, but just what we needed to break up all the carbs and fried stuffCalamari - the best I've had! \u00a0Not heavy or greasy at all!Tortellini - I'm not a huge fan of cream sauces, but the prosciutto was a good pairing with this pastaBroccoli Rabe - again a nice break from the carbs and fried stuffService was great and they were the perfect amount of attentiveness (not constantly interrupting, but also not MIA). \u00a0We also appreciated how extensive the wine menu was and that all the wines were categorized by Light, Medium and Full Bodied. \u00a0It made selecting a wine from their vast selection so much easier!", "Date": "2014-06-18", "Author_Location": "Pittsburgh, PA"}, {"Author": "Courtney B.", "ReviewID": "4ZxYnGCIbaxvzTrceM7n4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A group of my friends planned to go to Quartino's for a birthday dinner.

We started with the salumeria which maybe I don't appreciate since I haven't developed that fine a palate yet, but the meats and cheeses were just fine. However, I did enjoy the raw artichoke hearts in EVOO with carrots and onion which is something I don't get everyday.Next came the potato gnocchi which was a fine dish. The gnocchi were tender, slightly chewy and the pesto sauce was fragrant. Little bit on the small side though.Had to have a meat dish so we ordered the beef short rib. Compared to other short ribs I've had before, this one just didn't have enough flavor. The sauce was light and the meat was pretty fatty.The star of the show was the calimari which was wonderful, crunchy, and came with a tasty dipping sauce. Fried stuff usually wins!The tortellini in alfredo was also decent. I feel like I could have made something similar to it in taste just by making a trip to the grocery store.Pizza with sausage was meh. The crust was good but the pizza was pretty wet so eating it was a bit difficult with the end just flopping all over the place.Dessert was good, I don't recommend ordering the donuts though since there's nothing crazy about a plain fried donut in chocolate dipping sauce.

I came on a Sunday night around 9pm and it wasn't very crowded. 1) Veal Meatballs Napoli ($8.50)The veal meatballs were soooo soft!! Probably one of the best meatballs I've eaten. The meatballs were generously topped with raisins and tomatoes which complemented the lightly salted meatballs nicely. This dish was really worth it too - $8.50 for 4 large meatballs. I chose this over the other two meatball dishes (a meatball slider and polpette al sumo di pomodoro which were meatballs dressed with a tomato based sauce) because I wanted something different and less traditional. 2) Asparagus Risotto ($11.75)I saw many Yelpers raving about this dish. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this dish very much. It just felt as though I was eating creamed asparagus or thick asparagus porridge. 3) Roasted Baby Octopus ($10.50)My favorite dish of the night. The octopus was tender and you can taste a slight char on the tentacles. 4) Steamed Clams ($11.75)This was pretty ordinary. Steamed clams with white wine and served with some toast. I enjoyed it nonetheless. 5) Zeppole ($5.50)A HUGE plate of doughnuts (7 or 8 pieces). Soooo good. It's served with both a honey and dark chocolate dip. Was too full by this point for two of us to finish all though. A very hearty and satisfying dinner which I enjoyed thoroughly. Now, having tried the top 3 most reviewed tapas restaurants on Yelp, I would rank them in the order of the number of reviews each of them have ;) 1) GATG, 2) Purple Pig and 3) Quartino.

We commented on the risotto as exceptional and he went on to tell us about the rice they import from Italy and how that adds the quality to the dish. he gave us his card and said call, email me with any comments.

We got the gnocci, margherita pizza, truffle risotto, and polenta fries. The truffle risotto was by far the best dish we had. It was absolutely delicious! The only downside was that it was pretty small for three people (I'd recommend at the most for two people). The pizza was alright; nothing super spectacular, especially in a city that's known for its pizza. The gnocci was definitely my least favorite. It had a weird taste that I couldn't place. I believe on the menu it was listed as pesto/basil or something and it didn't taste like either of those things. The polenta fries were alright. I enjoyed them, but I wish they came with more sauce. The sizes of the dishes are pretty small, which kind of was a bummer, especially for how much you're paying, so keep that in mind when ordering to share.Our server was decent. He was nice, but when it came to picking a wine, he made me feel kind of uncomfortable. We wanted to try a couple wines because we weren't sure which one we wanted, and whenever we'd ask to try a new one, he'd respond \"Oh...you want ANOTHER one?\" I might just be overreacting, but it definitely made me feel like he didn't want us to keep trying wines. He also made me feel a little uncomfortable when we were asking about the portion sizes of the food. His suggestions almost made me feel like we were fat for ordering so much food. It was...interesting, but I think he was trying to be nice for the most part. A lot of his suggestions were also questionable.The restaurant itself is EXTREMELY \"cozy\", meaning you are literally inches away from the table next to you. I had a whole lotta butts rubbing against me trying to squeeze through the tables, which would more reasonable if the butts all belonged to other patrons, but most of the butts actually were servers....Overall, it's a little pricy, but some of the dishes are worth it.

I can be a little wine picky and he was really patient while I indulged a bit of high maintenance and tried four wines before making up my mind of what we decided to go with. Zakariah was wonderful and gave us two dishes that were sent to the bar by accident - a sausage pizza and a tortellini plate. Both were good so we felt comfortable asking him to order whatever he would recommend for us. He selected the burrata, a cured duck dish and delicious grilled octopus.Everything was delicious and when the bill came it was an unbelievable value! Honestly, I have never had a meal of this quality at this price.

We get them every time. The polenta fries are great with the red pepper salsa on the side. The cavatelli is fresh and always delicious. The paparadelle al sugo di manzo is pasta with braised beef sauce. It's very rich and comforting, and the pasta is house made. Our favorite pizza is the quattro stagioni, filled with vegetables and topped with grana cheese.The desserts are all winners. Our favorite is the hot chocolate cake. WOW. The gran coppa quartino is a variety of gelato with hazelnuts, and there is also a dessert of donuts with dipping sauce. Both are incredible.

Quartino serves small dishes, basically Italian tapas. A lot of places have moved towards small dishes and vastly overcharge, but Quartino doesn't really overcharge, I felt the prices were entirely reasonable.Went with the Cloudy Bay savignon blanc, quarter liter is only $15 and the Cloudy Bay is one of the most expensive wines on the menu! Other wines were as little as $7 for a quarter liter - incredible! Quartino will always be a good option if only for this reason.Our first dish was the veal meatballs in a tomato-basil sauce. The meatballs were certainly very good, though I would have preferred a little more seasoning to the meat. They bring parmesan for you to grate yourself and red chili flakes which added the flavor I desired though.Our next dish was maybe my favorite - the creamy polenta. It was cooked perfectly, just smooth enough but still with good texture and had a delicious cheese flavor. I added a bit of parmesan on top though this was unnecessary as the polenta had a delicious cheese flavor already.Our last savory dish was the ravioli. While the ravioli was fine, I guess I was hoping for a bit more, especially based on the menu's description and some yelp reviews. The flavors in the ravoli really just melded and I didn't get any of the unique incredients.Lastly we had dessert. She went with a cannoli which she said was excellent and the size was perfect for dessert. I had a half tiramisu which was still huge, good, but enormous. I took half of my half tiramisu home.

A couple of friends were in town this past weekend for a sailboat show down at Navy Pier, and they were looking for a good Saturday evening dinner spot. This place was absolutely packed to the rafters (mind you there are two floors and each floor has a lot of tables). Usually with big places, the service and food quality suffer a tad. There are just a lot of logistics involved in getting everything to line up for everyone. Quartino's apparently is as seasoned in the business management department as they are in the kitchen. Service wasn't the quickest, but it was also Saturday night and of myself and two dinner guests, none of us were ever wondering where the waiter went. I forget the server's name but he was knowledgeable on everything we asked him about (whether it be food or wine or even where some of their products come from). Having worked in the service industry for an extended minute or two, these things really make a difference. He was also friendly yet brief--he wasn't trying to schmooze us on anything and made great recommendations. Oh, yes, the food, I agree with some other reviews that the mushroom risotto was pretty average, but everything else was dynamite. Most notable was the Tuscan risotto, I believe. Italian doughnuts served with dark chocolate and honey for dessert was a great way to cap off the evening, in addition to some lemon-cello--though it may have been more bitter than the sweet I was hoping for. And last, price. Price was very reasonable for quality. We shared 5 plates, 1/2 liter good red wine, dessert and lemon-cello all for just south of $100.

I attribute this to the super busy Saturday night although that isn't an excuse. We were rarely checked on, food took quite awhile to come and I wouldn't say anyone working there seemed particularly happy. The lady hosts had no expression and were not welcoming when we checked in and one even yelled at the other in front of us.Overall, the food was very good, nothing amazingly great but definitely good quality and flavor. Ambiance - not a great choice for a celebration of any kind. I would definitely go back but only for a quick, casual lunch or for a drink at the bar. Also very touristy - something I don't usually mind but I know some of my fellow Chicagoans try and stay away from places like that.

It is rare that yelp lets me down, but every once in a while it happens.for starters this restaurant is rated at a $$ which I feel is not correct. everything on the menu cost between 8-15 each, which sounds pretty inexpensive. trust me it adds up. my boyfriend and I ordered 4 things off the menu and dessert. the 4 dishes which were small plates came out as two-raviolis-on -a-plate-size. so after are 4 dishes were we both hungry, and let me say that I am a light eater. For two people to make a meal you would probably need to order 6 or 7 dishes. The food was good, but honestly nothing sticks out as being good enough to be specifically mentioned. Even though the food was good we couldn't justify ordering another 2 bites of food for $15. We ended up ordering dessert which was normal size and let me tell you, it was great. We had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. It was warm, chocolaty, gooey, sweet, magnificence. If I could I would give the cake alone 5 stars, everything else about a 2. The service was fine, it was a rather busy night so I understand the want to get people fed and out as fast as can be, but the staff seemed very impersonal and like you were just another tab. For a \"nicer\" place I expect a waitress who takes a min or 2 to go over the menu or check up on you. The bill came out to be $70! I felt like we were being stolen from. I don't think one should ever spend $70 and leave a restaurant hungry.

I'm glad the windy city appreciates the act of sharing food!I checked out Quartino with two friends around 6pm and we were seated very promptly. It started getting more packed around 7pm. The interior is lovely and has a very different ambiance than what you would expect from a typical sit down restaurant. The staff are all wearing soccer jerseys and the decorations enhance the Italian atmosphere - you can even read different Italian newspapers while you wait!We started off with a complimentary serving of bread. The bread was not appetizing at all. It was cold and seemed somewhat stale, and it actually reduced my appetite. Not the best start to a meal.Our first dish was the baby spinach salad with pears, walnuts, and ricotta. The salad was nothing impressive at all. Super easy to replicate, and here you are spending $8 on it. Get another salad instead.Next was the duck prosciutto pizza. It's fairly well sized for the price, but you could hardly taste the duck that I eventually forgot I was eating duck pizza. What was more prominent was the generous topping of fresh arugula on top that added a unique peppery twist to each bite. The inside of the pizza was great, but the crust was way too hard.The last item to come out was the pappardelle (broad flat pasta) with braised beef tomato sauce. The pasta was tougher than what I'm used to, but apparently this is intentional. The beef and tomato sauce was excellent though. This is a sweet and savory dish that's easily enjoyable.On a humorous note, the bathroom utterly surprised me. I saw a gentleman who obviously worked there chatting it up with a customer while music was jamming in the background through a stereo set.

It's a big space, but somehow still cozy and intimate. It's loud, but still romantic. It is a great place for so many occasions. I have been here for girls nights, my 21st birthday dinner with family (this place is Italian-grandma friendly!), with my parents, and of course with my boyfriend. Each time is an exciting experience and EVERYONE I have taken here ends up loving it and going back. I will say, for my boyfriend and I, the noisy and cozy atmosphere is a perfect date, but I could see how some people looking for a quiet, \"fancy\" evening would not want to go here on a date.The tapas Italian idea is genius. I am from a huge Italian family so during family gatherings I know the terrible pain of wanting to try everything but having eyes bigger than your stomach and getting full too quickly - the horror!! At Quartino I get to try every dish (yes, I am the annoying person who also wants to try everyone's food and will reach my fork over without asking to take a bite!). I have had almost everything on the menu over the years and I would have to say the pork shank and the pappardelle are my favorite. I will say the pork shank is a bit salty, but I love salt so not a problem for me!! Napoli style pizza is my favorite and lucky for me, Quartino serves it! I like the sausage the best.I fully admit that I LOVE bantering with the waitstaff no matter where I am. I know some people hate this, but I personally love to talk and get to know some good tips from my waiter while making witty conversation. The waitstaff at Quartino is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very, very friendly (as an Italian restaurant should be!!). When my boyfriend and I went to Quartino over Valentine's Day weekend we had the most wonderful waiter yet - Joe! He offered awesome, honest advice on our food questions and had some great tips about the alcoholic beverages as well. He was very good to us and I am going to request him next time we go!

The dishes were like I said mediocre except for the scallops but the dish was also 16 dollars for three scallops so that wasn't such a great deal.

It was better at Pizza Antica. I had to add more salt/pepper and olive oil to this burrata, but it still had had great texture. I also liked the difference in texture in the salad between the cubed beets and shaved beets. Half/Half Pizza: I LOVED that you could get Half and Half!I will preface this review by saying I am not an authority on pizza and maybe pizza connoisseurs might be up in arms about how this was not \u00a0traditional Neopolitan style pizza,. but I enjoyed it.The crust \u00a0was not blasted by the heat of the oven and completely charred. It was completely cooked through and had a nice crunch and slight chew. When I come back I will definitely order it again with different flavors. \u00a0Campania Fonduta, House Made Ricotta, Oven Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, & Hand Torn Basil - $12My Favorite of the two pizzas! The Housemade Ricotta had a nice luxurious texture and was delicious. I also loved the strong basil flavor. I would order this again!Prosciutto D'Anitra Onion, Duck Prosciutto, & Wild Arugula - $13I really like pizzas with Arugala. I love the flavor of Arugala and It really helps balance the inherent heaviness of pizza and lightens it up. . I however was not blown away by the duck prosciutto and there really was not enough to really get a sense of the flavor. Overall it was okay but not great and I will probably try another pizza in lieu of this one next time.Eggplant Parm: Mom ordered this and she really liked the strong basil flavor that was present all the way throughThe Good: Great Service /Solid Food/Lots of Variety on the MenuThe Bad: Far/Difficult to Park (Used 14$ Valet)/Cut to the Chase: 4 StarsUnexpected choice but Solid Italian food will definitely return if in the area", "Date": "2013-08-20", "Author_Location": "Salt Lake City, UT"}, {"Author": "Catie R.", "ReviewID": "86ttGACmyHrqMlWdtEwwbg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had heard great things about this place from co-workers and was finally able to give it a try when my boss was in town. We came in around 6pm on a Monday night and were seated immediately; about an hour later we probably would've had a short wait. As soon as we sat down I knew I picked the right place. It has a very casual atmosphere perfect for dinner with coworkers or friends, perfect for a single girl like me who eats out with her guy friends a lot - I hate when places feel too \"datey\". But, it's not so casual you couldn't come here on a date. It's a perfect balance!The waiter asked if we had been there before and then explained the concept about how plates were normally meant to be shared among groups, and how the portion sizes would differ from your typical restaurant. We decided to just get our own \"entrees\" and so we both ordered salads, and my boss ordered a pizza and I ordered shrimp.The waiter also brought me several samples of white wine to pair with my shrimp, since I typically drink red. He was very knowledgeable about the wine without being pushy.I had the caprese salad, something I've been afraid to order since my trip to Rome back in 2009. It was just like being in Italy - the mozzarella was fresh and the balsamic was addicting! The shrimp entree was great; the only \"negative\" was my fault. I was expecting the shrimp to be over a bed of pasta but looking back the menu didn't say that. But it was still good! My boss let me try some of his pizza, it was EVOO-based rather than using marinara sauce.

We didn't make a reservation for a restaurant in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, on a long weekend. So obviously, we were going to have to wait. On the recommendations of a friend (and a quick check on Yelp) we decided to try Quartino. We got in line to put our names down for a table, while our friend tried to scope out the bar area, where they do serve dinner and seating is first come first serve. The host said there would be a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and a couple of minutes later, scratched our name off because of a call we got from our friend, who had found a table in the bar area. \u00a0We settled in and ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which was very nice. After a lot of too and fro, we managed to decide on dinner. We ordered the Dates wrapped in Pancetta, the Braised Pork Shank, Duck Prosciutto, and the Spaghetti All' Arrabbiata ( spaghetti in spicy tomato sauce). I think the dates wrapped in pancetta and the braised pork shank, tied for Best Dish of the Evening; however, my husband says the braised pork shank was the out-and-out winner. The Pork shank was fall-of-the-bone tender and beautifully flavored, an absolute piece of perfection. The Dates were stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce, wrapped in a nice salty pancetta and then drizzled with honey. They tasted like little bites of heaven. The Duck Prosciutto was accompanied by some Giardiniera (pickled vegetables) which were very tasty on their own, but completely over powered the prosciutto, in my opinion. The prosciutto was also, extremely tiny pieces, and definitely my least favorite dish of them all. \u00a0The Spaghetti was the last to come out, and a pretty big portion. It was flavored very nicely, with the perfect amount of zing to it, and the Parmesan they had on the table, complimented it well. For dessert we ordered the Zeppole, described on the menu as 'Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate'. When we ordered, I asked our waitress which would be better, the honey or the Dark chocolate, and she told us that she'd just bring out both. Boy! Am I glad she did. The dark chocolate was without doubt the table favorite, and got over before the last doughnut did, however, I really liked the hot doughnut with the honey as well. That said, if I had to choose, I'd go with the dark chocolate. My only complaint about Quartino was the announcements over the speakers. The hostess was using a mic to call out the names of people waiting for a table, but the announcements were so loud, that we could not hear anything else, and had to pause in our conversations every time she would announce a name and since this is a huge restaurant, with a fast turn over, the announcements were beings made every minute or so. I think Quartino should turn down the volume just a little bit, so that the announcements aren't jarring.

As a result, I can be a tough grader on Italian restaurants, so keep this in mind as you read further.I arrived at Quartino slightly before my 6PM reservation, and thought \"What a cool place!\". People were sitting outside, along the street, and some were on the second floor balcony overlooking State Street (that great street). There was a lot of street and subway noise (a couple subway vent grates are on the sidewalk beside the outdoor seating), so I decided to get a table inside, as I was meeting 3 business colleagues and wanted a quieter atmosphere more conducive to conversation. When I got inside I loved the decor and ambience. Very much trattoria meets Italian deli; warm and inviting. Shortly after I arrived, 2 of the remaining 3 members of my party arrived so we were shown to our small table for four in the middle of the interior space on the first floor. We were amongst the only ones there, and the ambient noise level was acceptable (hint: notice this is the second time I've mentioned noise level and I haven't even gotten to the food yet).The fourth member of our party arrived a few minutes later, and oddly enough, that seemed to be the time when a large influx of other diners occurred. Our waitress came by and got our drink orders, and I could barely hear her. She was somewhat soft-spoken, though.She explained that Quartino was a different kind of restaurant, that the portions were small and meant to be shared, and that the best way to enjoy the menu is to order a few things and they would arrive as they are ready, then order a few more, etc., etc., until you have your fill. A huge stack of plates was in the center of the table to allow for a continual flow of new tastes and food.We ordered a round of beer and started off with a Quattro Stagione pizza, and olive plate and some veal meatballs. The olives were delicious, the veal meatballs were out of this World, however the pizza was a huge disappointment. The crust was horribly soggy and wet, and the toppings all slid off the crust every time we went to take a slice. Clearly this is because they didn't drain or otherwise dry the toppings adequately (my guess is it was the artichokes that flooded the crust), and water leached out all over the crust and other toppings. Absolutely inexcusable in a place that promotes its pizza as much as they do. The only way I could eat it was to smash it all together on my plate and scoop it up with my fork.The next wave of food was a decidedly better: decent fried calamari with rather bland marinara sauce, some excellent pork dish and very good gnocchi with a cheesy spinach sauce. After working our way through our \"second round\" and a few more beers, we moved onto the dessert. The dessert seemed to be more of an individual thing. One of our party ordered a raspberry sorbet and enjoyed it; another tried some sort of banana coppa thing and he said it was delicious; I ordered a plate of zeppole with chocolate sauce, and they were divine. Perfectly fried and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, bitterness and chocolate flavor. Now, as for the noise. It was horrendously loud once the whole dinner crowd arrived. I gave up trying to hold a conversation with anyone not seated directly next to me and couldn't hear a single thing the waitress said after taking our initial drink order. Sure the place was crowded, and yes the tables are close together, but my ears were literally ringing when I stepped outside, and didn't stop ringing until I arrived home after a 10 minute Red Line subway ride. I think part of the issue is the hard floors and tin ceilings provide no sound absorption at all. I dunno - but I do know this almost ruined the evening for me. I don't know if it would be any better outside, but I can't imagine it being worse, even with the street noise, cars and subways rumbling past. So, all in all, not a bad place. I'll may go back; will likely try to sit outside; and I may even try the pizza again, but absolutely no pizza with any topping that needs draining or drying or that contains a lot of water.", "Date": "2013-07-24", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mike L.", "ReviewID": "qKMU2YNOT-kMdIc1ztUXsQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Post dinner at motoNot bad at all!Tasty pizza \u00a0packed with veggies, including hot red peppers.

Our pasta was an angel hair with vodka sauce and garlic and it was the ideal serving size for two mildly hungry people who still would like to devour a delicious thin-crust pizza.

There was also a side of pickled vegetables that I wasn't very impressed by, but this is more because I don't really care for pickled things in general.The pizza, oh mygoodness, the pizza. Ricotta cheese, soft cherry tomatoes, basil, I don't know how this could possibly go any better than it did. The pizza was so fresh and delicious that it felt like every bite I took only increased my happiness further and made me crave more! (rather than that pesky diminishing returns theory). I honestly have a slight desire to live here in Chicago forever just so I never have to be too far away from the pizza. I don't really like deep dish pizza too much (too heavy with the tomato), but I love thin-crust, and this thin-crust pizza is, without a doubt, the best I've ever had.Quartino, I will keep you in my heart and memory until we can finally be together again!!

I even took some vegan friends here and they have a number of dishes that are vegan friendly without lacking on taste and quality.For dessert, get the donuts and ask for both the chocolate and the honey sauces.

We split a plate of bruschette which I found to be different in taste and more artistically plated than I've seen at other places.

The tortellini was amazing but unfortunately I am newly lactose intolerant so I had to get the half order (my stomach still voiced its displeasure after my meal). I think my friend ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana and then tasted the Giardiniera Romana, which was actually pretty good for being pickled vegetables (our server was kind enough to get her a tiny plate of that because it was too small to begin with to make it a half plate and my friend didn't want to order it fully in case she didn't like it).

They're priced reasonably, have great dishes and the restaurant itself has a great interior. It's a comfortable atmosphere, always with a good amount of people and usually a old vintage movie playing on their tv screens. It's perfect for multiple occasions, a nice date with someone, a casual get-together, or a group outting. The bar section is quite nice too, although I haven't ventured over there yet, but their selection of alcohol is mainly wine with some beers, at least in the dining section.As for food, there are some great items and others just mediocre. Their pizzas are really delicious and so well-priced (at most $13 for a full custom-made pizza), and the pastas are equally as good. I recommend the Linguini with White Clam Sauce. Some of their appetizers, soups and salads don't have as much to say, they're not bad but not noteworthy. So I would definitely go with pizza or pasta. Their style of dining is Italian style so everything is supposedly shared (if you choose to do so) which is really nice when you have a group of people to share among. I would highly recommend this place, it's got the right vibes and you can tell by how much business they get that they have earned their reputation in the area.

Saturday is always busy, I called to make reservations on Thursday one time and they only had 5:30 or 9'oclock for dinner available for that Saturday already. Another thing I've done sometimes is ordered pizza that I can pick up without having to wait for a table, which if you call ahead only takes 20-30 minutes.

To say this place is 'packed' every evening, would be an understatement. The 9 - 5 local crowd begins to filter in right after work, and dining goes late into the evening. Being a regular on TA and Yelp, I had done my homework and learned that Quartino is a popular place with both Chicago visitors AND locals (always a good sign). The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable, and very loud. (Think: gregarious dinner party with 50 of your closest friends and alcohol flowing - in a cavernous room.) \u00a0Yes, THAT kind of loud. The wait staff is friendly, efficient, knowledgeable, and extremely accommodating. We were lucky enough to meet Lanny, Alicia, and Jose on our Sunday evening visit. They were exceptional, to say the least! \u00a0Professionalism that matched a 5-star restaurant, but with the ease of a carefully-planned family function. My husband, a former Disney employee, and I noted the outstanding service. \u00a0This is a tapas restaurant, so the menu is pretty overwhelming with so many dishes from which to choose, if you're new to tapas. That's where your wait staff can help, offering suggestions - about pairings, how much food to expect, etc... Speaking of pairings, the red sangria was wonderful! And.... \u00a0you can order just the size you want. I highly recommend a liter.... it's sublime. \u00a0The Husband chose martinis and wasn't disappointed. An excellent bottle of wine rounded out our over-the-top meal in this amazing restaurant. (We splurged a tad.) \u00a0Attire: dressy casual for evening - not too fancy, not too casual - 'city chic' or dressier resort wear would be appropriate: dark jeans, slacks for the guys, or a nice summer dress. \u00a0 You'll find seating indoors and limited outdoors, though our HOT July visit kept us indoors. It's a great restaurant for couples or groups... like an Italian family meal, the chairs are pulled up to accommodate all who arrive! \u00a0I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant for families with small children/babies after 5 PM... not because they wouldn't be welcomed, but because of how loud it is. \u00a0We saw a few families with small children, (looked like locals), and they were leaving shortly after we arrived around 6:15 PM. We did notice a few teenagers with parents, and even they kind of looked a little overwhelmed at the noise and pace. \u00a0During the day, probably an entirely different story. It IS, after all, a very comfortable place. \u00a0 Saved the best for last - the food: \u00a0WOW!!! \u00a0We tried a few dishes: \u00a0white bean and garlic spread with crusty bread, calamari with a house red sauce, beef tips, beef ribs, and gnocchi. All were outstanding, but the gnocchi and beef tips stood out as 'exceptional' - with rich flavors, perfectly cooked, and paired beautifully with red wine. Well into my 40's, I never truly appreciated the red wine/white wine pairing concept - and I'm a wine drinker who's visited Napa Valley a few times - until our visit to Quartino. The beef tips deserve a dry red wine.... mouth-watering!! \u00a0 OUTSTANDING. \u00a0Be sure to visit the upstairs restrooms and check out the entryway as you go through their doors.

The food is always delicious. \u00a0We recently traveled in Italy for nearly two weeks, and we felt that the food at Quartino was generally better than \"real\" Italian food. We always get a selection of meats and cheeses (parmigiano reggiano and prosciutto di parma are favorites). \u00a0The calamari is delicious. Our pasta favorites are the tagliatelle alla bolognese and the pappardelle al sugo di manzo. \u00a0Both are very flavorful and have a good mix of meat, sauce, and pasta. My husband loves the roasted baby octopus and we get it fairly often, but this dish tastes a little off to me every time. The desserts are delicious, especially the donuts with the dipping sauce.My one complaint about the food is that a very good bone marrow dish, which was on the menu after it was revamped about a year ago, was taken off a while ago and has never been back. \u00a0I wish Quartino would bring back the bone marrow, as it was very good. Maybe if people ask for it, they'll put it back. Quartino's prices are quite reasonable: we almost always spend less here than we do at other River North spots. Reservations are a must (often a week or so in advance for weekend) as the restaurant is always crazy busy. Without a reservation, you're looking at a wait of at least an hour on the weekends. \u00a0It's also very loud \u00a0(although we generally manage to hold a conversation). \u00a0Quartino seems to attract a lot of bachelorette parties, which adds to the noise level. \u00a0I normally hate noisy restaurants, but my love for the food outweighs any noise-related concerns.", "Date": "2013-06-21", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Annette U.", "ReviewID": "XwrXuByNqpbow2PA9wk0EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my go-to place downtown for cheap eats and wine for the last 10 years or so.

In fact, it was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time - mostly due to the atmosphere. However, the food is decent/pretty good, and probably deserves 3 stars. I would never recommend this restaurant for dinner, but it may be a nice option for dessert. The cons: - It's extremely LOUD inside the restaurant, probably because they try to squeeze in as many tables as possible in a small area. If you're sitting next to a loud party, don't even try having a conversation with your table because you won't be able to hear a word anyone is saying, even when they're right next to you.- The tables are extremely small and cramped. My party of 4 was at a table that was better suited for 2. Add on the dishes and pizza once they started to come out, and you can imagine that no one had any room to move at all. - The food was not as amazing as I expected. In addition, the portions of the pasta & risotto dishes were really small! I was shocked to see how small they were, given their price. We ordered the following:  \u00a0 - Funghi Pizza - Roasted Portobellos & Crushed Tomatoes - $11 \u00a0 - Tortellini - Alfredo Sauce, Peas, & Prosciutto - $11.75 \u00a0 - Mushroom Risotto - Fresh Mushrooms, Mushroom Puree, & Pork Stock - $11.50 \u00a0 - Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce - $11.75The pros: - We made a reservation beforehand for a Saturday night. When we arrived, we were seated right away. \u00a0- Perhaps if you're seated outside (which we were not), you'll have a nice view of downtown. - My favorite dish was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo. I'd recommend this dish, even though the portions are small.- We were impressed by their desserts (they were delicious!) and thought they had a large variety. We ordered the following:  \u00a0 - Zeppole - $5.50 Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate \u00a0 - Profiteroles - $6.50 Vanilla Gelato, Chocolate Sauce, & Toasted AlmondsOverall, if you only have a couple of meals to eat in downtown Chicago, don't waste one of your meals at Quartino.

This place is huge and really loud so I wouldn't come here for a romantic quiet evening. It would be good for large birthday dinners, etc. We saw a couple bachelorette parties when we went on Saturday night. They cram the tables pretty tightly. Food was pretty good. Everything is designed to share so it comes out when it's ready. This is good because the food is piping hot when it arrives. As soon as we were seated, a plate of sliced bread was dropped on the table. It was cold and a bit dry. It had clearly been sliced awhile ago and was sitting around waiting for the next table. Disappointing first impression. If you read any of my reviews, you know that I like my bread to be warmed and I think poorly of restaurants that don't make that effort, since it is so easy to do.We started with the fried calamari. It was hot and crispy. I liked that it wasn't greasy and the breading didn't come off. My only complaint was how stingy they were with the marinara dipping sauce. It was a tiny amount compared to the amount of calamari. At least it was warm. Second course was linguine with white wine clam sauce. The noodles were perfectly al dente. The clams were plentiful. The sauce was well seasoned. This was our favorite dish of the night. Our last course was the braised pork shank. Our server told us it was braised for nine hours. It fell off the bone and was super tender. It came on a bed of mashed potatoes. This dish would've been better if it was better seasoned, and if there were more potatoes and sauce on the plate. I'm always surprised when restaurants are skimpy on cheap ingredients such as potatoes and grits and rice. Our server was friendly. He was training a newbie and we got the impression he was showing off for her. He kept saying how jealous he was of our meal, something he probably says to all of his tables.

I know, such a Yelp cliche but whatever. There are so many reviews but here is my short (hopefully) but to the point review.+ Good for groups. I've been here for alumni functions usually held upstairs. This past summer I hosted a group of 10 ladies for a bachelorette party dinner. I looked into getting a private room for us (through private events section of website), but due to keeping costs down, ended up with reserving a table in the dining area. It actually worked out since the party attendance wasn't as big as expected. Actually, that same night, I think we saw about three or four other tables with bachelorette party people. + Even though portions are small (think tapas style), I always leave like I ate one big meal. My parents were in town for Thanksgiving. My dad liked the idea of small dishes because he thinks he's gaining a belly. Whatever, dad. He liked it so much we came back...three freakin' times in a week. In our defense, we didn't order the same dishes each time. The favorites though were the shrimp risotto, polenta fries (my personal fave), the not so spicy salami (name escapes me), and fried calamari.If you don't like loud places or sit somewhat too close to the next table, this might not be for you. Otherwise, it's not a bad option to take out-of-towners and/or need a place for a group function. You can make reservations via Open Table.

Reviews.In 1492, Columbus sailed and I see that Quartino has reached 1592 reviews... I'll see as to how clever I'm feeling in making a joke about that.I've been going to Quartino (there IS no 's in the name... But we are in Chicago, It isn't JEWEL, (the grocery store) it's Jewels) for about 7yrs now. Is the FOOD that fantastic? Well... Depends upon what you get. Not everything is entirely consistent, but it doesn't suck either.This isn't \"Italian Tapas\"... This is ENOTECA. Similar to tapas, and the Italians have just as long of a tradition in doing \"small plates dining\". The pizzas come in one size and yes... ONE person COULD knock it down. This is NOT \"pasta by the POUND with red-lead\" spaghetti joint and it isn't Chicago Style Pizza. I could get into a lecture as to how a REAL Italian (meaning, in Italy) meal would go and 99.9% won't believe me, because you keep going to places in ROME or VENICE where the menu is ALSO in ENGLISH.Pasta is a very \"small course\" in a coursed meal and one rule is: fish and cheese do NOT come together in the same meal either... Much less dish. On a pasta a-la vongole (clams in white sauce), DO NOT have cheese grated on it!In some instances, the food IS that fantastic. The house cured Duck Prosciutto (no, there is no \"H\" in spelling prosciutto) is AMAZING. You CAN have it on a pizza (which I highly recommend, Prosciutto D'Anitra... nom, nom, nom) as well as on it's own for Salumeria. Get over your hangups about chicken/duck. YES, you CAN CURED duck. In Japan... I'd be down with chicken sashimi.And I trust Chef John Colleta. Chef John is one of those guys whom you've NEVER HEARD OF... BUT, he HAS trained some of the guys whom you have/ are hearing about NOW and some of those guys... When their projects didn't go as well as they could have/ should have, go BACK to working for John Coletta.His boucherie/ salumeri/ bunch of cured meats & sausages with cheese on a board, is one the BEST in Chicago.His sauce Bolognese doesn't suck either. Most reading this, don't really know that Sauce Bolognese is a meat ragout (ragu) where the meats are TEMPERED/ braised in milk, then TOMATO. The Italians braise a LOT of meats in MILK. Chef John's is one of the better Ragu Bolognese I've had. Certainly here in the city of Chicago. And I love the house-made pasta.One of the more INTERESTING BARGAINS on the menu is: Veal Skirt Steak. THIS is my go-to dish. Sizable portion of protein, arugula and roasted tomato salad... Phenomenal.Steamed Clams in Pinot Grigio... Under $12? And that MUCH clam? Seriously?Where the place falters is... Some consistency. Over the winter, they were running Roasted Cauliflower and Brussels Sprouts. SO FRICKIN' GOOD! Seriously, lemon, garlic, chili flake and Olive Oil, roast and it was AWESOME. Yet, the absolute WORST broccoli rabe. Kills me. And I LOVE these BITTER greens. Arugula! Kale! Brussels Sprouts! And their Rabe... as well as the sauteed spinach... Pathetic, overcooked and sitting in this watery bath of camouflage green. Worst. For sure a spot on the menu that fails me.Beef carpaccio ain't all that either.The grappa cured salmon was AWESOME and I wish they would bring that back. The seared tuna was really good too.Salads are very good as well as imaginative. Cesar has too much anchovy.Their version of Chippino/ Frutti De Mare... A friggin' BARGAIN.Considering that \"doing 1,000 covers (people)\" is a s l o w night... And how BIG the place is, This place keeps up some awfully good standards to the food. Maybe not \"Cheesecake Factory\" standards... But we aren't talking about \"Cheesecake Factory\" and you really don't want to know what I think of that as \"cuisine.\" I respect Cheesecake Factory as much as I respect Satan himself. There are some SERIOUS BARGAINS on the wine list too. There really IS a reason as to WHY I've been coming here for 7+yrs and yes, it helps that MOST of their menu is available until MUCH later than 99.9% of when restaurants are serving their FULL menu. Overall, the food is solid and the staff is great. Service, be it; at the bar, in the bar or in the dining room... Everyone has always been great to me.The menu is BEST when you step out of comfort zone as well with going for seasonal dishes.

This place was perfect in my mind because I love Tapas and Italian Food. What a great idea to have small plates for Italian food. Bravo.Our team arrives here at 6 PM on a Thursday and we were still missing two folks. They told us that they would seat us once our party arrived which I did not mind and felt was fair. Finally the last two members joined the party and we were brought into the main dining room of the bustling restaurant. It is quite packed in here and there is not a whole lot of wiggle room as a warning to folks. Since it is in fact pretty packed, the noise level is on the loud side as well. The d\u00e9cor of the joint was inviting and casual which was reinforced by the tables placed closely together. It made it seem like one large family at a dinner table ready to consume a delicious meal. I was a fan of the ambiance.The service was also super friendly. The waiter was very knowledgeable over all of the food including what vino to order based on what type of vino we were looking for. They were attentive throughout the meal even though each waiter seemed to be waiting on multiple tables. We ordered a ton of plates to share which included the veal meatballs, the Bolognese, penne ala vodka, the margherita pizza, and the parpadelle. Everything was delicious honestly. A solid joint and definitely hearty enough to share with folks. The penne alla vodka was one of my more favorites and the meatballs were great as well. I was worried that they would be a bit bland but they were flavorful so definitely a plus. Everyone loved the small plate experience as we were all able to try multiple different things without getting full quickly.This is definitely a great place to bring a group of folks to spend some time bonding with folks.

I live in Pittsburgh and have literally thought about this restaurant every day since my return a week ago. So where do I begin....My co-workers and I were looking for a great restaurant for dinner after we had spent the day traveling and working. Those of us who still had battery life on our iPhones were searching away on Yelp and Urbanspoon, trying to find a great spot for dinner. The first place that we found was small and had a 1-2 hour wait, so we decided to find another place.We were exhausted and starving when we finally stumbled into Quartino. It was a Monday night, and the restaurant was pretty deserted. We were quickly seated on the upstairs balcony. (Yes, we were lucky enough to be in Chicago when it was 68 degrees in December!) They tried to seat all five of us at a tiny table, but I asked if we could push two tables together to have more room. I think the staff anticipated that we would just order a small glass of wine and tiny appetizer to share... but they had no idea of the appetite we had worked up all day. We were ready for some serious ordering and table filling.Service was prompt and polite. The waiter presented our wine in a very formal manner, which I thought was interesting -- and a little awkward. However, once I began to eat, the food was so delicious that I entered an Italian food coma, ignoring all that was going on around me, including the fact that I didn't realize the balcony was completely filled until we left at 7:30pm.The great thing about trying new restaurants with a group is that you get to try so many different things! We tried -- Margherita Pizza, Salumeria Tasting, White Bean & Garlic Spread, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Cavatelli, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Tortellini, Penne alla Vodka, and Beef Short Ribs. All of our dishes were at least good while many dishes ranked in the excellent-and-still-dreaming-about-it-a-week-later category.I highly recommend ordering pasta here. Every pasta that came out seemed to top the previous. The Cavatelli in particular was a table favorite. As a pasta lover, my love of pasta is why I'm dreaming of returning in the future. I was disappointed in the Margherita Pizza -- it was a bit cold and bland -- but was told later by friends that the poor pizza quality is more of an exception than the rule. Apparently, they normally have fantastic pizza. I'll have to order a different type next time!Most importantly, I can't forget the wine! My table ordered a bottle of red and a carafe of white and only spent about $50 or $60 for both. And finally, the total bill... this will blow your mind......10 Dinner Items, ranging from Salad to Pasta and Meat+1 Bottle of Wine and 1 1/2 Liter of Wine=$200Wow. Not sure how that's possible... we were delightfully surprised that we walked away completely stuffed from a tapas restaurant and only spent $40 each.And all of the above is the reason why I will be dreaming of this restaurant until I return sometime in 2013.", "Date": "2012-12-12", "Author_Location": "Pittsburgh, PA"}, {"Author": "Preethi R.", "ReviewID": "6k9TjNWyz6oA6pZTotns7Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Came here with our friends who live in Chicago... an were excited to have them try sangira... but we felt it was very watery!

What's great about tapas is that there's so much variety and the dishes are small. This offers a lot of food tasting, and is really great to socialize with.I came here with two of my other friends, and got seating right away because this spot is LARGE. There's a big first floor, and just as large second story. It's quite unbelieveable. Having such a vast menu, I would just suggest you not overly think about it, and just order what you think sounds good & have at it. That's the best way to do it!Foods don't come in any order. It's what ever is cooked and it just comes out. For example our sampler plate of meat and cheeses came last while the pasta and baked stuff came first. Odd, but not bad at all!Off our dinner adventure, I would recommend the following:1) Eggplant Parmigiana - I'm enjoy eating eggplant, and when breaded, I love it even more! Rich with flavor. Excellent!2) Steamed Clams - YES! Must get. Small clams, delicious in flavor. Rich! Save your bread and dip it in the juices. So much yum in a plate!3) Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Pasta ribbons with braised beef in tomato sauce. As a pasta lover, this was devine. The braised beef was so soft. Very simple and well made.4) Veal Meatball Slider - Different and good. Eat this when it comes out and don't wait on it because it will get cold!Other tidbits -- if you are a Neopolitan Pizza lover, this spot may also be for you! The options for their pizza's were pretty large, so I'm going to assume that this is their bread and butter on top of tapas actually. For a couple that comes in, this may be the way to go if tapas isn't your thing.Wine options galore. Middle of the road pricing in my opinion. Not cheap, but not too expensive.

For those who don't know, Quartino is a small plates restaurant dealing in Italian cuisine - they are meant to be shared. My friend and I shared the caprese salad, the sun dried tomato soup, the penne alla vodka, and the shrimp risotto. Caprese: pretty simple, nothing special. Soup: same. Both the penne and risotto were suuuuuper hot (I just love fresh hot food), and was delivered without much of a wait. I enjoyed the penne more so than the risotto, but both were really good. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was INCREDIBLY loud - I could barely hear what my friend was saying. There was one particularly loud party of about 10 people next to us, and I definitely threw some dirty looks their direction for being so rude and loud.

Ravioli w/ braised pork and fava beans: this dish was delicious but a little saltier than it needed to be. \u00a0With the prosciutto and parm they don't need to add so much salt!Chicken: garlicky and deliciousCalamari: fresh and well seasoned. \u00a0The portion was a bit too large for tapas though.

The GF pasta is a corn pasta, which tastes as good as any we've tried, and mixed into the sausage ragu it was phenomenal.

The fried calimari was perfectly cooked, just a bit of chewiness and fantastic. The pasta was probably the best I've ever had. I could have eaten a vat of it myself. I'm pretty sure the noodles were fresh, not dry, as they were just unbelievably tasty and perfectly cooked. The sauce was meaty, flavourfu and just the right amount. I'm still dreaming about this dish. The pizza was pretty good. I don't love pizza in general, because I can't have cheese. Pizza without cheese is sad. They were very careful about topping only half of the pizza with cheese, and did their best to cut carefully to avoid cross-contamination. The Hubster really enjoyed his cheese-laden side.After this, the Hubster and I were full to the gills and exited with leftovers, which ended up being the fanciest breakfast anyone has ever had at a picnic table by an outlet mall.

The average 3-Day walker burns 6,000 calories...I'm pretty sure dessert alone accounted for my replenished caloric intake, but that's neither here nor there.When taking care of reservations for myself and my traveling entourage, I was faced with a number of challenges. First, had to find a place that was condusive to the budget of a friend who had recently lost her job...second, there was a vegan on this trip. Now, the restaurants that I had bookmarked did not exactly cater to the needs of my friends and given that I wanted them at the event for the support thought it necessary to accomodate and so I took the question to the Chicago Yelp threads where of course I was met by haters wondering why I hadn't just used the search function. On the flip side of the mild elite harrassment, one kind soul suggested Quartino and that my search could end there. So it was written and so it was done, reservation made days before our trip, and we were good to go.The restaurant itself reminded me a bit of an Italian version of Parc in Philadelphia, not over the top. Our waiter was great, explaining that the menu was tapas style and that plates were meant for sharing but could easily be ordered individually. Next you know we're ordering every type of cheese on the menu, pastas, salads, the works. The idea of budget went straight out the window when we started ordering wine. Dinner came and went, I ordered the octopus only to find that they had already sold out for the evening and so my order instead went to pancetta wrapped gorgonzola stuffed dates drizzled with honey; simply stellar. Shortly following was a pork belly and an heirloom apple compote. My meal?

There are tons of details and moving parts that if not thought out well could easily take the evening in a direction from fun and intimate to disastrous and awkward. With so many options and a paralyzing fear of failure, naturally I turned to the advisement of my fellow Yelper party planners extraordinaire for suggestion. Quartino was surprisingly the overwhelming front runner and apparently for good reason; the event and private dining staff were so on point I was able to throw the birthday dinner to end all birthday dinners. Tune the kazoos, hero Brett saves the day!! \u00a0Despite it looking like a tremendous amount of effort on my part (kudos to me), putting this event together couldn't have been easier (kudos to Quartino). After combing through their numerous group dining menu options and selecting our dishes for a 4-course prix fixe meal - which really breaks out to 9 dishes - I was able to sit back, relax and let the magic happen. We arrived to our private room - The Wine Cellar Room - to find a warm, rich space enveloped in wood and flickering candlelight. What a far cry from the bright, rip-roaring scene inside the Quartino main dining room... no need to scream to hear the person beside you, this was perfect and intimate. My addition of some floral table arrangements (thanks Jayson Home and Garden) and tons of extra votive candles created quite the mood. Is it a dinner or a seance? Who cares, it's super sexy. With the house red and white wines overflowing together with great conversation our dishes began to arrive in multitude...Round One//The Antipasti: Delicious, chewy Neapolitan pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, zucchini, funghi), veal meatballs and crispy calamari. Yum! Round Two//The Pasta Course: Cavatelli with ricotta, tomatoes, fresh basil (unfortunately served a bit on the lukewarm side) and buttery Tagliatelle Bolognese. More meat sauce for me!!Round Three//The Main Dishes: Garlic shrimp with E.V.O.O., Pinot Grigio and lemon (my fav of the evening), Farmhouse Chicken with lemon and herbs (boring, bland) and the Prime Angus Beef with seasonal vegetables (a perfect medium-rare sliced filet with tangy balsamic roasted root veggies). Round Four//The Dessert: Dark Chocolate Fondue served with a collection of fruit and homemade biscotti. Sinful, delicious, perfect for sharing. \u00a0 Small unique details like personalized menus printed with a distinctive message for the birthday girl, unlimited portions for our dishes and fabulous service from cute boys helped me to overlook shortcomings like cold dishes, a 30 min wait for our room to be ready and a forgotten special dessert with candles for my guest of honor. For $35 p/head + the unlimited wine package at an add'l $15 p/head, this party was a tremendous steal! When exactly did wine become cheaper than water??

I remember some subway tile on the walls, some mirrors, and a flat screen (that played the single weirdest black and white movie outside of a John Waters flick I have seen in some time). Loud and boisterous, with much hollering and pushing throughout the whole place.Now, to all of you nay-sayers who complain about Restaurant Week being a \"rip off\" - that you are being cheated out of decent portions and/or high quality food, I say Quartino just called that bet and took all the poker chips. \u00a0Yes, at first you hear the word \"tapas\" and you think it is going to be a dish where you will get 2 bites at the most. Even our waiter said \"3-5 dishes per person is average\", and of course the RW menu offered 4, so it seemed like a no brainer. \u00a0Except, these dishes are freaking FULL SIZE and it seemed like a taunt after the 6th plate was brought to us. \u00a0What we ordered:Roasted Bone Marrow with horseradish gremolata: \u00a0This was actually an instance where you only got one bite from this dish. The bones are huge, but the marrow is very stingy and will fill up one piece of toast with ease. Extremely garlicky and slightly rubbery. Not worth the listed price ($7.25). If you want a religious bone marrow experience, I suggest David Burke's instead.Italian Artisan Fondue: \u00a0Fondue was slightly more watery than I would have liked, but the flavour was good and the type of bread offered held up and did not get sloppy and drenched from the liquid cheese.Garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello: thick lamb sauce over a quilted pasta. Enough said.Orecchiette with a fennel/sausage ragu: thick, hearty pasta with a rich sauce. \u00a0Not as good as the Garganelli, but a close second.Beef Short Ribs: Lovely, succulent beef that was spoon tender and marinated in some sort of delicious sauce. A fave.Beef Fillets with broccoli rabe: \u00a0another item that yielded only about 2 bites each, but by this time we were groaning from stomach capacity. \u00a0The meat was absolutely delicious, the vegetables too cooked and somewhat bitter.We then opted to take the desserts home, the Torta di Cioccolato (chocolate cake with vanilla gelato) and the Zeppoles (donuts with dark chocolate) \u00a0Thank god we did because those desserts were heavy, dense and rich as hell.

Although people call their food \"tapas\", it's not - it's just how food is served in Italy (smaller first plate, then the main plate). I've been to Quartino's many \u00a0many times now and have brought a variety of people there. The service varies but the food is consistent. I've eaten outside and in a private upper area, and sound was not a problem in those areas. The main eating area and the bar area, however, can be very very loud and are very crowded. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable, especially for its location. The restaurant isn't too busy in off-hours, so I'd recommend adjusting your eating schedule on weekends and walk by in an off-hour and eat outside in the warm weather. The valet is the cheapest in the area, too!They have a variety of wines that comes in a variety of sizes - very convenient. Everyone seemed satisfied with their wines. The Bellini is awesome - I'm absolutely addicted!! It's white wine mixed with pureed peaches. It's an absolute must for you to order meats and cheeses from the salumeria menu (quartinochicago.com/menu\u2026) - try two meats and two cheeses for a good variety. You may have to ask the waiter for the salumeria menu - sometimes they don't automatically bring it to the restaurant diners. But if you're visiting late night on the weekend, this menu is great to curb your late-night appetite! And right when they bring the order, ask for more bread because they definitely do not bring enough and ask for olive oil if it's not on the table. The gnocchi is a little softer than it should be, but it is flavorful. The sea scallops have been improved since my first visit, and is my favorite item now (I often crave the sea scallops and sometimes get them at other restaurants, but Quartino's \u00a0sea scallops is the best to me). The Prime Angus Beef Tagliata is excellent and the organic chicken is good - very moist. All my friends seemed happy with their pizza, and many friends rely on the quatro formaggio on their regular visits. As for how much to order per person, I usually order from the salumeria menu or a smaller plate to share and then one of the larger plates for me. I believe their prices have slowly been increasing by a dollar every few months. Their hot small plates are $8, their pasta and risotto is $9 and the specialty plates (including sea scallops) are now $16 (I swear these used to be $12). I'll keep coming back to this restaurant to keep experimenting. Their reasonable prices make for a guilt-free dinner. Plus, I'll keep coming back for their Bellini's!!!**Update** Yes, their prices keep increasing. Sea Scallops are now $19. Risotto is now $10-12. The hot small plates are still $7-10.

Seriously weird vibe guest-wise.

Plus the service is great and the ambiance is perfect for a big family meal. The menu is set up tapas-style so that you order a bunch of little things to share. I liked this as it allowed me to indulge in my favorite eating habit, i.e., trying a bit of everyone's dishes. We tried a wide range of the menu, from pizzas to pasta to seafood, so there was something for everyone. The standouts for me were the mushroom risotto, the polenta fries, and the penne in vodka sauce. The risotto was just so creamy and delicious, we had to order a second helping. And I liked that it was earthy without suffering from the lack of flavor that sometimes plagues this dish at other restaurants. The polenta fries were a wildcard. I was expecting them to be pretty bland but they were really well done. Crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside, with a tomato-based dipping sauce that isn't the traditional marinara. The penne in vodka sauce wasn't overly unique or unusual, just really well done and tasty. I also tried the pesto gnocchi, which I was expecting to love. In truth, it wasn't bad, just not as good as the others. The pasta was pillowy and light, but the sauce could have used some oomph. Maybe more basil in the pesto? Or parm? More cheese and butter never hurt...except, you know, heart- and health-wise. The pizza was the only disappointing part of the meal. I tried the margherita and it was just off. The crust wasn't crispy, the cheese and sauce were bland, and it lacked that overall salty/tanginess that I love so much. Kind of a bummer. But honestly it would have been hard to surpass the marghy I had at Flo & Santos the night before. The salmon, on the other hand, was a saltsplosion, in a good way (if you're a saltaholic like me). The stewed tomatoes were a nice addition to the fish. I had only a bite of the lemoncello dessert thing, and it was uh-mazing. Our server took great care of us and didn't cop a 'tude when we kept throwing additional requests at her. She kept our waters and sodas refilled, brought us extra wine glasses right away, and made sure we had utensils and napkins for each round of food (the bussers had a habit of snatching them away).

We arrived at 6:15PM for our Friday 6:30PM reservations and the door was packed with a long line. Thank goodness for OpenTables! We were seated on the second floor by the windows overseeing the nightlights of State and Ontario. The restaurant has a very vintage touch with lights dimmed out and tables intimately aligned. The wait staff in white aprons was in and out of the dining hall bustling with orders. The food was oh-so-captivating that I fell in la-la-la-love! The three of us ordered the Neopolitan Pizze with prosciutto d'anitra onion, duck prosciutto, and wild argula. It was per our waiter's suggestion and by far, the best pizza I've ever had! The thin piece of tossed flour was spread with tomatoes, parmesan, and mozzarella. Pieces of delicately sliced duck prosciutto were scattered across and baked to perfection. If you like bacon, you would like duck prosciutto. The onions were there but barely noticeable. That's a plus for me! I usually try to avoid dishes drowned in onions. The wild arugula put the whole pizza in camouflage but they were very fresh and crisp! We also ordered the crisp calamari and linguini with clams, red chili, and red sauce. The calamari was seasoned with black pepper just the way I like it! It was superb when sprinkled in lemon juice and dipped in a side of marinara sauce. The linguini had a generous share of baby clams. The shreds of red chili were very welcoming and not a bit spicy.

something about liters like we're gonna know what a liter equals).The two of us are about the friendliest customers you could ever ask for as a server, but he was just going through the motions, unfortunately. \u00a0When we ordered our food, he commented, \"Yeah, you may have enough to share. \u00a0Might get stuffed, might not.\" \u00a0What does that even mean, anyways?Anyways, we got our food in piecemail, which, since it was small plates didn't surprise me, but since we weren't really sharing (not knowing it was small plates when I reserved), it wasn't so great.The portabella bruschetta was tasty, but nearly impossible to eat. \u00a0The ingredients were really huge & fell off the bread all over the place (since the table was so small, really, all over the place). \u00a0The broccoli rabe was ok, but man, I got a bite that was allllll black pepper. \u00a0The polenta fries were -eh- & the roasted red pepper sauce that with with them was less than eh.She ordered the linguini with clams, which I didn't try (she didn't comment on if she liked it or not). \u00a0I wanted to order the mushroom risotto, but it's made with pork stock (ew), so nope. \u00a0In fact, why is it that when a lot of restaurants have what would otherwise be vegetarian options, they have to use animal stock, nullifying the veggie option? \u00a0Annoying! \u00a0Anyways, instead, I ordered the penne alla vodka, which was the best part of the meal.For dessert, our waiter finally stepped up & recommended the chocolate cake with ice cream, which we ordered, although any of the options sounded tasty. \u00a0We got it & it was crazy rich, but good, nonetheless. \u00a0We were unable to finish it, however.When we were still eating our dessert, we were given the bill. \u00a0Even though we were assured that there was no hurry, our waiter hovered within feet of our table for the next few minutes, just staring at the tab. \u00a0The upside was that our water glasses were refilled about a dozen times between placing the dessert on our table & when we did leave.Wow. \u00a0This is long. \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0I probably won't be back, is the bottom line.PS: \u00a0If I were the owner/manager, I'd take a look at these reviews & change a few things. \u00a0Like how freakin' loud it is. \u00a0I don't agree with a fellow Yelper's assertion that restaurants should be noisy & fun all the time & that the only reason a person would go out to dinner would be to eavesdrop on crazy conversations. \u00a0What about, oh, I dunno, the FOOD?

We were excited about the 3 course lunch, but figured we would need more food, since it was intended for two people, so we ordered a pizza as well. Well, that was unnecessary...Our first course was fondue, and the cheese was DELICIOUS. We refused to give the fondue up even when we ran out of bread! Our second course was tortellini with peas, alfredo, and prosciutto, which I didn't love, because it had too strong of a wine taste to it, but I'm sure they have other great second courses.

Safe choices, but both were very good... also, our waitress as great- so informative and helpful.

The manager came up to us several times to ask if we needed anything, and also explained to us some of the meanings behind the art on the wall and the old school movies playing on the tv.

Since this place is always packed and insanely loud, I asked if we could be seated upstairs, which was still insanely busy and full of many bachelorette parties and large groups, but much quieter than downstairs.

On a Saturday night- this place is hopping- noisy, people bustling about, bachelorette parties abounding- there was so much going on it was like a carnival. But that just set the tone for our evening which was light hearted and fun. We had a reservation and got a table right smack dab in the middle of the room- which, while one in my party thought was a bad thing- I rather liked being in the center of it all (although my seat was not on the walk through like his was!) The windows were open to let in the night air and this room with it's simple wooden tables and chairs set a rustic tone. We started with a \"build your own\" antipasti platter which came with prosciutto, 3 kinds of cheese, raisin bread and a variety of spreads to try with them. There is a wide range of meats, cheeses and vegetables that you can choose. Next up we split one of the many pizzas that they had. We chose the mushroom which was really quite good. I could have stopped there but one in our party wanted us to try her favorite- the orechette pasta with ragu sauce which was as good as she promised. No room for dessert- so we headed back to the bar to wait for yet another friend and to enjoy a glass of wine after dinner. Surprisingly- the bill was reasonable given the amount of wine and food we had (about $100 for 3 of us), service was quite good given the amount of tables our server had, and the noise and bustle didn't bother me like I thought it might.

The wine list is extensive and I loved that it told me the wines that Quartino is the only restaurant outside of Italy to serve. They could have been lying to me. I have no idea. But I wouldn't have cared. It made me feel special, and to be quite honest, I've rarely met an Italian wine I didn't like. Just the taste of a Montepulciano or a Chianti and some cheese, bread, and prosciutto, and I'm in heaven. The \u00a0salumi menu is extensive, and the pile of prosciutto I got was beautiful - fresh and not too salty. The Caprese was good and so were the olives. That was really all I needed. I never moved on to the entree, although my dinner companion did. I honestly don't remember much about her meal, as I was kind of zoned out on my own small (but actually kind of large!) plates.

Here are my only complaints: a) because of the large open spaces and the number of visitors every day, the place can get really, really loud (difficult to even hear the person sitting next to you) and b) I was once served Spaghetti with Marinara when I ordered Carbonara (kind of a significant difference - though I honestly dug the Marinara better, uh oh).

The tapas concept compounds the problem of overcrowding. The waitstaff simply cannot keep up with the rhythm of the dining experience.

We were barely able to squeeze our way into the lobby after getting through the revolving door.Once you adjust though, this is a fun little restaurant. The d\u00e9cor is really cool with a lot of old subway tile and an open kitchen. The space definitely has some character. There's a neat wine bar in the front of the building where you can go hang out and have a bottle of wine, or three if you go with a group without reservations because it will take awhile to get seated. The crowd is stylish, young, and good looking. I'd best describe it as Lincoln Parky kind of crowd. I don't think I've seen that many ladies with over-the-knee boots in any one place in my life (not a bad thing!). It's definitely not touristy like a lot of River North restaurants are. A+ on the people watching meter. \u00a0The food is also a strong point. This isn't heavy pasta dishes smothered in a gallon of red sauce like Nonna used to make. It's a \"tapas style\" situation where the dishes are smaller and meant to be shared. An interesting trend in Italian cooking. We tried a few appitizers. Started out with their Salumera Tasting. Basically, this is a combination platter where you get to choose two meat types, two cheeses, two olives, and two vegetable salads. Went with Bresaola and Prosciutto for meats, Gorgonzola Dolce and Provolone for the cheeses, and Sicilian Caponata and roasted beet (never thought I'd order beets in a restaurant but what the hell!) for the \"salads.\" The dish is sufficient in size to serve at least two people with moderate appetites and a little pricey at $25. But it was really good, particularly the Gorgonzola and Caponata.For the main dinner, I just had a sausage pizza (was feeling a little basic after the Salumera!). Very good and flavorful. The wine list is also reasonably extensive, and relatively affordable for a downtown restaurant. There are plenty of bottles in the $20s - not bad at all. \u00a0 Service was prompt and friendly, which is a credit given how crowded it was and how many large tables the waitstaff had to deal with. The waiter was really cool and good about explaining things, which was helpful given the somewhat unique concept. In the end, I'd highly recommend Quartino for a group of friends who want to spend an interesting night out. The food is very good and the overall experience with the \"intangibles\" added in is even better. I would, however, make reservations given how popular it is, and be prepared to spend a little money as it's not particularly cheap.

From start to finish it was wonderful. I had been to Quartino a few times prior over the years for work lunches, but this was my first weekend/dinner experience and the hubby's first time altogether. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed and buzzing! No worries, we had a reservation and were promptly escorted upon arrival to a cozy corner table that shared a booth bench with the adjacent table. I was skeptical about the size of our table, but it proved to work out.The server we had was marvelous! He was super-attentive throughout the dinner. He explained how we should order several plates to share and that everything comes out as it is ready. We had scoped out the menu prior so we already had our menu for the night picked out: Caprese salad, Gnocchi with arugula pesto, Short ribs with salsa verde, and, of course, a bottle to share of the house red wine.The Caprese salad was amazing! Something about the balsamic syrup makes those raw tomatoes (I never eat raw tomatoes) tasty and addictive, not to mention fresh mozzarella being one of my favorite things in the world. I already remembered that the gnocchi was one of my favorites from a previous visit, so it did not disappoint on this occasion, either. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth-tender-fantastic! Did not really notice the salsa verde, but the meat spoke for itself anyway. We finished the evening with dessert--the torta al cioccolato with vanilla ice cream. Oh man, heaven! Any time you pair hot chocolate cake with ice cream, it is a winner. This cake was wonderfully moist and melty and the ice cream was just perfect.

Saturday night in downtown...7 of us...no reservations. By some miracle, even though the place was packed, Matt (I'm assuming if not the owner, then at least a part of upper management) was able to find us a round table that we were seated at immediately. The place was packed wall to wall and everyone was laughing and having a great time.I had never been so I was intrigued by the fact that the orders come out whenever they're ready and that sharing was encouraged. Our server was Brian or Ryan (I must have said it 15 times each way trying to figure out which one, but never quite got it) Haha. He was a superstar! He encouraged us to start with a tasting, which he created for us. His recommendations were dead on. I'm going to try to remember everything we had...we had roasted peppers, roasted beet salad, eggplant salad, two different prosciuttos (one of them duck - both of them phenomenal), one soft cheese and one salty cheese (the soft, which I believe was the Fontina was to die for), and of course lots and lots of bread. We were in heaven and we were just getting started.From there, we ordered two wines, champagne, and then the most delicious meals that I could have ever imagined. I hope I don't leave anything out. There were veal meatball sliders (voted number one fave by one of the seven of us), gnocci (which was a hands-down favorite), fettuccini (another huge hit), lasagna (which was unlike any lasagna I have ever had before...the noodles completely melted in your mouth and each layer seemed to blend perfectly without leaving you too full), the pasta with the lamb ragu (garganelli con ragu d'agnello) - my personal favorite of the evening, and roasted baby octopus (which was just insanely delicious).Then, we moved onto dessert. Since I was in from out of town, we decided to go somewhere else (pops of champagne) - which proved to be the biggest disappointment ever. After such an incredible meal at Quartino, it was the most disappointing way to finish off the evening. Why am I writing this here, you ask? Well, because our night at Quartino hadn't quite ended yet. With a terrible dessert taste in our mouth from pops, we decided to see if we could strike gold one more time with Quartino. We waltz back in (all seven of us) and are promptly greeted again by Matt, who looks royally confused why we're all back. We explained to him what a let-down pops had been and how we couldn't end such a good night with their sad excuse for desserts. He sits us right back down at our table and, without any hesitation, orders us three different desserts...on the house. I was blown away. We had their Italian doughnuts (which were so fresh and exquisite), tiramisu, which normally doesn't appeal to me, but I couldn't get enough of this one, and one of their infamous gelato dishes, topped with bananas and deliciousness. Because of the gracious service, remarkable food, and obvious hospitality of Quartino, my first downtown experience in Chicago will be an ever-lasting memory.

I'd recommend the pizzas over the pastas--the pasta sauces tend to be a bit heavy for my liking, but the pizza is crisped to perfection (try the Margherita or the Pugliese) and a welcome break from heart-attack that is Chicago deep dish. Of course no Italian meal is complete without some great red wine, and Quartino has a solid, reasonably priced selection.Though it's permanently crowded here, service is very attentive and food comes out quickly. The noise level on a weekend evening can be a bit unbearable at times, but it rather adds to the family-style ambiance of the place.

For a Chicago restaurant, Quartino does offer quite a few options for vegetarians, (YAY!!) One time we ordered a pizza that already had several toppings on it and asked to have fresh arugula added. The pizza arrived shortly after with a huge pile of crispy arugula on top! They know what they're doing. The service is fast! Each item takes about five minutes to arrive once you have ordered it. It makes the whole situation very simple as you can sit there drinking your wine and order as you please until you are full. I like that. They always give you bread and oil before your meal and it's difficult not to dig in and eat a whole bunch - It's filling!

To be completely honest, I'd sum up my experience here with a hearty \"Meh.\" The restaurant was so loud that keeping up a conversation with my friends was difficult. After waiting for thirty minutes for a table, we were seated in the corner of the restaurant, tucked between a wall and the entrance to the kitchen, only to wait for another fifteen minutes before we even saw our waitress. Not a good start.I liked the concept of the restaurant going in, but I was a little bit disappointed by the execution. The create-your-own antipasti was a fun addition, and the meats (prosciutto di parma and an air-dried salami) and cheeses (taleggio) which we selected were delicious; the accompaniments, unfortunately, were hit-or-miss. \u00a0I was very disappointed by two out of the three olives in the tasting portion -- I didn't know it was possible to serve a bad olive, but I guess there's a first for everything.The veal meatballs were tender, juicy, and flavorful; however, the accompanying sauce was far sweeter than what I was expecting and what I deemed desirable. The calamari, covered with far too much batter, was rubbery both in terms of texture and flavor. The polenta fries were also tasteless, although that could be blamed on either the person who invented polenta fries or the person who ordered them rather than the person who prepared them for our consumption.The desserts almost made up for the lackluster food. The caramelized banana sundae was good, and the lemon gelato \"panino\" was similarly delicious. The best thing, however, was the biscotti that accompanied the sundae.All in all, I think if we had ordered better, my experience would have been better. That being said, I still think everything on a menu should be on the same plane.

I highly recommend making a reservation in advance so you spend as little time in the crowded bar/waiting area as possible. Our table of four had a reservation but still had to wait a few minutes before we were shuffled upstairs to our tiny corner table. Although we felt claustrophobic in a small-space, high-traffic area, our waitress was attentive and kind, and most importantly, gave us genuinely great recommendations for our orders. We decided to share a bunch of different small plates, from traditional caprese salad to the cheese fondue (a must-have with apples!) and the highlight of the meal -- the clams. The clams were fresh (even though we're as far from the coast as I've ever lived) and the broth had a perfect amount of kick. And of course you have to have dessert, which at Quartino is a generous serving. It's always a good sign when they don't skimp on the important things.

Try the pastas and the pizza - I think these are definitely the best dishes at Quartino. 3. Avoid the polenta fries unless you enjoy the taste of pure deep fried food.

The risotto was, well, pureed asparagus just like it says. If you only sorta like asparagus you might find it overpowering but I thoroughly enjoyed it. And the clams were piping hot served with a really good white wine & chili broth. Just a hint of spice but not too much. After sharing a litre of chianti, we found ourselves a little hungry still and also got a margherita pizza.

Just visiting a friend & she suggested this place since she went here before & said that they have amazing \"tapas\" style dishes that you can share with the whole table.*** Your meal comes with freshly sliced sourdough bread with butter !! ***Ordered:- Linguine with clams - DROOLING just thinking about this. It had SOOOO much clams in here, it almost seemed endless! And they cooked it in white or red sauce (we chose white) and seriously..... it was cooked to perfection! It was spicy too.... and you know you can't go wrong with a spicy dish!- Calamari - Been craving calamari for ages and this place was so delicious. It was baked / fried just the right amount. Came with marinari sauce, YUM! I could not stop eating this dish........ it was just that good.- Arugula salad - This started off our meal just right. Lots of greens for healthiness. It came with pine nuts and orange slices. The lemon zest of the sauce made this salad really tasty. It wasn't too overpowering so you could basically eat this salad forever haha.- Parmesan eggplant - This was my least favorite dish because I'm not a big fan of eggplants & the cheese was wayyyy too much. It was literally a FAT blanket of cheese over a thin amount of eggplant. Meh.I also loved the venue of this place. It's really a type of friendly group restaurant.

We were so happy to see the many vegetable options since most of us are pretty health conscious and meatless, but the delivery was questionable for some of the items. The caponata was delish as were the beets. The artichokes were bland and the roasted peppers - I have never actually had a red pepper that literally tasted like nothing. But alas, these peppers were pure texture and zero taste. Not to mention everything was drenched in olive oil. The cavatelli was delicious as were the cannelini beans. The spinach and broccoli raab were not memorable - no seasonings or flavor.Overall, it was ok. Nothing truly offensive, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.

Both qualifiers for at least 4 stars.I Yelped Quartino before we decided on it for dinner the night after I ran the Chicago Marathon (a Sunday). It didn't sound like the BEST option but we didn't want to wait long and we wanted to eat somewhere within the hour. Hence, the celestial union between Quartino and our little group manifested itself. We were out of towners, but worldly ones who live in Boston, so I don't rate this place with an Applebee's / Oilve Garden perspective.This place looks far classier on the outside than it ends up being. It has a more welcoming rustic, European countryside feel inside.I got the feeling the food was not freshly prepared, as in, it is prepackaged stuff that they heat up, or they make it in big batches ahead of time. That being said, it was still very tasty, so I'm not sure exactly how it works.We got some bread (cold, not heated) which was okay. Olive oil only on the table for dipping (no cheese, no spices). We chomped away on that while I ordered some wine and we looked over the menu.We each got our own pasta dish, although they stress ordering together and sharing the dishes here \"tapas style\". It's called \"tapas\" but it is not Spanish food. It's Italian food, and there are pizzas. So I think Quartino is a tad confused and can't quite decide whether they want to be Italian or Spanish or tapas or not....The food was good and I would revisit, as I said. I would say, though, that the prices are too high for the portions and quality of food you receive. Too pricey. Maybe it was the downtown State Street location?One thing that threw me: the way you order the wine. You order it by the pint or something weird like that. I thought I was looking at 1/4, 1/2 or full as a glass - and thinking, this must be some pretty damn good wine, because it was $20+ for a glass! Turns OUT that those ratios, on the menu there, they represent the portion of a pint pitcher you get. So... full = 480 mL = 16 ounces = 2 cups = about 1 and 1/2 \"normal\" glasses of wine. On top of all this confusion, you drink your wine out of what looks like a scotch glass. I was so thrown....I would like to go to Quartino again. Because of how confused they are about who they are supposed to be though, I can't say they beat out any other normal Italian or normal Spanish tapas restaurants I've been to.Wait: Made a reservation, so none, but looked like you could have walked in.Food: Enjoyed, but again, something weird about it...not made to-order.Service: Extremely friendly hostess and waiter.

I could see it being a good place for a first date, or to even catch a soccer game (I noticed jerseys hanging on the walls, and the servers were also wearing jersey shirts). I liked the atmosphere a lot, it definitely reminded me of Italy. There was an old Sophia Loren movie from the 70s playing on the televisions, perhaps to bring customers back to old Italy? We opted for the Lunch special for 2, where you got to select 1 item from the wine bar plates or soup and salad section, 1 item from the pasta/risotto section, and 1 item from the meats/seafood section. All for $25. Fianc\u00e9 and I got to pick different soups (minestrone and sundried tomato), and we also picked the calamari and the housemade Tagliatelle Bolognese pasta. The food was good; my sundried tomato soup came with fresh parmesan shavings and a small sprig of basil. The calamari was well portioned and despite its deep fry coating, was relatively light and not overly salted. The tagliatelle pasta did indeed taste house made and I loved the chewy texture. I've been contemplating purchasing a pasta maker and this only makes me want to buy one even more, which probably conflicts with my goal of eating less wheat/carbs. Perhaps after the wedding? heh. Our server was friendly and attentive. The washrooms and bar located upstairs are also very nice and well decorated. For $25 we were stuffed and had to pack some food to go.

Turns out, there weren't very many--even normally innocent items like gnocchi and risotto included PORK BROTH, for some reason. That left the vegetarians and Jews in our party with only a handful of options--sucky at a place where you're supposed to share plates with the carnivores and gentiles.Thirdly, the prices sucked just a wee bit.

M.", "ReviewID": "1Ww76SNeJ9iYknrMS5jIiw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Went Friday night as part of a party of 5. We had reservations, and my cousin (who made them) had asked for an outdoor table, but when we got there we were told it would be a 30 min. wait for that. We took a seat indoors instead (it was humid out anyway, so probably just as well). Indoors is LOUD. Like, people screaming, ears-ringing-when-you-leave loud. The two women in our group with less than-resounding-voices were impossible to hear all night. Our table was right near a waiter station with the big bread-slicing machine on it, which was in use the whole time -- normally the sound of it going would have been annoying throughout a meal in a regular-volume restaurant, but I assure you I never heard it once. The dishes are small and they encourage you to order multiple plates for the table and share (Italian-style tapas, essentially), and they bring out each dish as it's done; since I don't eat tomatoes, this limited the number of dishes that were available to me. I chose the mushroom risotto, which had a full depth of funghal flavor but was just infinitesimally undercooked; my cousin's shrimp risotto had achieved the proper creamy texture without the hard bite of undercooked rice remaining (I make risotto frequently at home, so I'm well aware of the process and what it should be like). The shrimp scampi ordered by another member of the party was serviceable, but nothing beyond what you'd find at Red Lobster (though the shrimp were a bit bigger); the texture did suggest that they'd been overcooked a bit (veering slightly towards tough). For dessert we ordered a Fantasia Coppa di Frutta, a trio of fruit sorbets (raspberry, orange and lemon), topped with slivers of fruit (granny smith apples, sliced grapes, pineapple), a biscotti, and lemoncello supposedly (didn't really detect it anywhere). The lemon was the best flavor; orange was okay; I thought the raspberry was too sweet, though someone else in the party loved it. This came in a metal cocktail glass (nice presentation) and was big enough for the five at the table to pass around and pick from.Also on the dessert menu is their list of liquers and Italian bitters; they also have house-made lemoncello and orangecello. Service was kept hopping because the place was so busy, but the tag team of two waiters who were helping us was attentive and patient when we needed a couple of rounds of extra time to deliberate over what to order (chatting got in the way of ordering).A note on the restrooms: I didn't notice this when entering the ladies' room, but upon leaving I saw that the space between the sinks and the door, where there might normally be a large mirror, is a big window that looks into the men's room! This does not look into the toilet area, just the entry area, but still, be sure to do your private primping before you reach this spot, if you want it to remain private; I witnessed one guy adjusting himself on his way out the door (gives a whole new meaning to the term \"people watching\").

It was served with, among other things, a spoonful of 'candied mustard fruit.' That, in turn, is a candied fruit puree of sorts that has mustard seeds in it.

I was also about half-way through my half-carafe of wine (really cheap at $8!), which may have influenced my mood, too. Thankfully, my server recommended a half-order of mushroom risotto, and I took her advice. When it arrived, it was steaming hot, packed with mushrooms and soooo good. It's creamy succulence was a perfect counter to the bitter / citrusy / fiery salad I had just finished. For desert, the torta de chioccolatto was over-the-top. Like the risotto, it arrived hot and fresh from the oven. It was slightly gooey in the middle, firm on the edges, and served with a scoop of vanilla gelatto on top.

The veal was juicy, and cooked perfectly. -Dates Wrapped in Pancetta: This was really rich for me. It was definitely delicious, but not something I could eat a lot of. -Cavatelli: Absolutely delicious. The flavors of the tomato, fresh basil, and ricotta were incredible. I would order this dish again.-Sea Scallops: The scallops were cooked to perfection. I was impressed with how good these were. Another dish I will order again. -Crisp Calamari: I wish these had a little bit more seasoning, but these were also cooked to perfection. I'm very picky about my seafood and I truly enjoyed these. Dessert-Coppa al Banana: This dessert was divine. It was a great way to end the meal, not too heavy and the biscotti was great dipped in the gelato.-Cappucino: If you've never had Lavazza coffee or espresso before, I highly recommend it. \u00a0I will be back to Quartino again in the near future.

Mmmm.Came here on a Sunday starving with two friends of mine post Football Sunday Funday. \u00a0Got a table on the upstairs terrace which was nice, but very crowded at the small tables.The bread that was brought to our table was a little stale but we ate it anyways. \u00a0The highlight of my meal was the $2.25 veal meatball slider I ate... Holy shit this was delicious. It was on some kind of ciabatta bread I think and it was just oh so yummy. \u00a0That was appetizer one... We all sampled on of those delicious little minis. Then it was time to sample some salads.Quartino's spinach salad came with walnuts which sells me right away. Anything spinach/walnut related for a salad and I'm in. \u00a0The only thing that was not thrilling about this salad was that there was SO much dressing. \u00a0Not that it was bad tasting dressing, but it was just an excessive amount of dressing. Ask for it on the side.The little tomato salad that we all shared was good too. Just baby heirloom tomatoes. Nothing too extravagant. Would be really good with a balsamic reduction glaze. That would make the salad perfecto.Next course was some pasta. \u00a0We got penne alle vodka and spaghetti alle vongole (clams). \u00a0The spaghetti was SPICY so if you are not a fan of spice, beware. Luckily for me I'm a red pepper and sriracha junkie so nothing can surprise my capsacin receptors. Nope. The spaghetti with clams wasn't very flavorful minus the spicyness so that was unfortunate.The penne alle vodka was good but it was served to us with some undercooked noodles. Not so yummy. I'm all about that al dente noodle, but when it's well undercooked from al dente.. meh. Ruins the pasta.The service was pretty decent, but our server forgot our lemons for the pasta, to bring us bread, refill the drinks, etc etc. \u00a0Took us forever to get the wine too.I gave Quartino's three stars not because their food isn't great, but because I'm a food snob and after having lived in Europe for 12 years, I can't help it.

Between those categories, I am always comfortable ordering a few things and splitting them between the group. Don't be afraid, here or anywhere else, to ask for WHAT YOU WANT. I will modify a pasta or pizza or salad to better meet my wants and needs and they accommodate me cheerfully here. I wish the salad selection was wider and that's my only menu gripe.

Even the restrooms are charming with the old school Borax soap. TVs in the bar to keep up with Chicago sports. Finally, how cute is it that there is a little market area where you can buy reasonably priced bottles of wine to go?

It was more cream that anything. And the beef was ok. By the way, thats all the plate brings. three pieces of beef. After a couple bites here and there. We thought that maybe pizza was their specialty since it was obvious that what we just has wasnt., We ordered a cheese pizza. OMG! It was HORRIBLE! they didnt even get the pizza right!Never going there again! I hear the wine is cheap and ok.

My 13 friends and I gathered to celebrate three of our birthdays all on the same night since they were within days of each other. We made a reservation for 9:30pm and all showed up at about 9:10. Unfortunately it was a REALLY busy night and we did not get seated until 10pm. But because of the delay, the staff sent over three plates of meat, three plates of cheese and two carafes of wine. Fo' free. Hello? (: They sat us in the private room, which normally would have a $20 per person charge, but they did not make us pay that either. Holy comps, batman... this place is already on my good side. Aside from our adorable and kind waiter, the restaurant's host kept coming into the room to check on us and make sure our dining experience was on-point. Also, he seemed to notice a colorful theme in this room full of 13 fabulous men and, well, me. So he flipped the football on our TV to Bravo, which of course was showing Real Housewives. The room applauded. We began to order food. The menu is set up with smaller plates, meant to share. There were many different tastes to please in our group so we ordered quite a bit of variety off the menu. I heard not one complaint! Everyone was very happy with the taste and quality of the food. After we stuffed ourselves, we of course had to order some dessert. I was too full for dessert, but a few friends ordered some ice cream (or was it gelato?) and I had a few bites. SO yummy. Most of the table ordered limoncello or coffee, too. Now the best part of the evening came right at the end (for lack of better term..ahem) when our lovely waiter--quite proudly--brought to our table (and placed right in front of me) the most realistic looking ice cream/banana phallus I have ever seen, complete with a lit birthday candle and, um, chocolate \"shavings\". After a tremendous bout of approving laughter we all sang happy birthday to each other, waiter and host included. What a fun ending to one of the most positive dining experiences I've ever had in Chicago. I highly recommend Quartino for a large group.

I found Quartino after looking at reviews and thought I'd give it a try. We ate here on Saturday night and I'm sure glad I made reservations. It was packed inside and outside! Just getting to the hostess stand was a challenge to push through all the people. As for the food.. Quartino calls itself a \"tapas\" kind of place so you can try a bunch of things and share. They encourage you to keep your menu at your table so you can order as you go. We ordered the oricchette with sausage, lasagna, salami, broccoli rabe, and a few other dishes I can't remember. The salami and pasta dishes were my favorite. They were flavorful and filling. I didn't really care for the broccoli rabe - it was basically boiled soggy vegetables with no flavor. We also ordered some of their white sangria - that was yummy. They have 3 sizes to order so its great for sharing.The main downside I had with this restaurant was the noise level. It was EXTREMELY loud... probably one of the noisiest places I've ever eaten at... and that's counting all the Chinese restaurants! It was hard to hear or even talk, it felt like we were screaming at each other. Towards the end it wasn't even worth trying to talk over the crowds.

Somebody tell the chef!- these fried doughnut things for dessert. They were tasty. We tried them with the side of chocolate but I think next time I'd go with the honey, which would better compliment the delicate flavor of the doughnut.Overall, the dining experience was pretty good. I did really like the decor and feel of the restaurant, which achieves an excellent classy-modern-antique feel that goes very well with Italian food. I was most taken with the prices, which are very reasonable for a good meal. A 1/4 carafe (a bit more than a typical glass of wine) of the house red or white is just $4. Steal!

Contrary to my personal rule, I found myself at Quartino on Thursday for a client dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. Very very pleasantly surprised.

Granted, they were the Viagra Triangle/Gold Coast/downtown high rise crowd, but none the less--I appreciated the lack of t-shirts. I ordered the scallops, and would have passed out from culinary bliss at the table, had it not looked extremely unprofessional. There is one thing that bothers me, though, and that's the WC system they have here. First of all, there's a bathroom attendant. Ugh. I always hate those. I do NOT need assistance putting soap on my hands and picking up a paper towel. Also, these attendants are always generous with the paper towels they hand you and it makes me just want to stay STOP! You're killing trees! I don't need an entire stack to dry two hands. Next, this is possibly the worst-situated restroom I've ever seen (next to the ones at Faith & Whiskey. Go there and you'll see what I mean). To get to the WC, you have to climb a hefty flight of stone stairs (though I appreciate the exercise, the angle and smooth finish of the stairs are not stiletto-friendly) and THEN you have to squeeze through a throng of people at the bar who are scarfing down appetizers at a buffet. The bar is RIGHT next to the door for the bathroom, and there are people smashed up against the bar trying to order drinks. These people are not anxious to move and lose their spot in the booze-ordering queue just so you can go empty your bladder. Otherwise, this place is great.

It's a great place for just about any occasion, special occasion, quick dinner, girls night, date, birthday party, whatever. The restaurant is kind of huge, 2 floors, always bustling with people, loud, kind of a market vibe-y, and they always play old school Italian flicks on the TVs (thanks!).They serve small plate style so the bill racks up quickly, but the food is so delish. The pizza is a favorite. It is thin crust and they let you order half and half, and can also substitute ingredients. For example, we usually order half rustica and half fumo negli ochi with arugula instead of spinach.. try it seriously. The pork belly with apple compote is really tasty. All of the risotto dishes are great, overpriced though. The eggplant parm is a must. Last time we tried the roasted bone marrow which was nothing special at all, too much breading. The wine list is really nice and they always have suggestions. I would not recommend the sangria here (go to Cafe Iberico if you want Sangria). The gelato dessert is yummy.The service can be inconsistent, it just depends on the night and who you get. We went on St. Patty's Day, and our waiter with the silly curled-up mustache was in a grumpy mood and only visited us twice :( But we've also been when the waiter was super friendly and cracking jokes :) Sit outside in the summer and always shoot for the first floor instead of second floor. OH also, I wish they had Parmesan cheese on the table at all times. They give you bread and olive oil and a mysterious white container with mostly Italian writing... so you just assume it is cheese when it's actually sea salt, and then you learn the hard way.

We made a reservation for 6pm on July 3rd, right before the holiday, and it was pretty packed. I loved the rustic, authentic ambiance of the restaurant. It's a family place (and kind of touristy), but it can also be very romantic. Other reviewers have mentioned that it's loud -- we sat next to the kitchen and it didn't seem loud at all. We were also very intrigued by the Dolce Vita-esque movie playing behind us, and while my boyfriend was slightly confused by it, I thought it definitely added to the mid-century Italian feel of the restaurant. On to the food -- we decided to order one pizza, one order of pasta and one order of tapas. I thought each dish was very well made. We had dates wrapped in pancetta, and some were very soft and meaty, others were a little bit chewier, but I still thought they were good overall. I do have a weakness for pancetta, so I may be biased. Then we had the cavatelli with homemade ricotta, tomato sauce and basil. I LOVED it. I think my boyfriend was unimpressed, but I loved the texture of the cavatelli, the homemade ricotta was fresh and the sauce was delicious. Then we had a small pizza, half arugula with duck prosciutto (my half) and half quatro stagioni. I only had the duck prosciutto one and I was also very pleased. It was very original, the prosciutto was *slightly* dry, but I still enjoyed it and I loved the crust. My boyfriend seemed pleased with his half, but I'm not sure. Our server was pleasant -- she was the one who recommended the cavatelli and for that I will be forever grateful. Lastly, I ordered a quarter liter of a sauvignon blanc for only $6!

My experiences here have included meeting friends for drinks and eats at the bar, a fabulous Yelp event, and a recent solo stop at the bar. Quartino is the perfect place to come for a little buzz , some noshes and a convivial atmosphere. So heads up all you lonely out-of-towners in the surrounding hotels. They bill the place as one where wine costs about as much as water. And they're not kidding.Wine comes in a 1/4, 1/2, or full carafe. The choices are extensive but not mind-boggling, and the menu divvies up the wine such as whites into lighter, medium or heavier choices, which is very helpful. Wine glasses are the small European bistro types, so you get 2-3 of these out of a 1/4 carafe. Well, that just feels like a deal, for $10.00, which was the cost of my Ferrari-Carrano Fume Blanc. \u00a0I added to the delectable wine choice a couple of veal meatballs sliders, an order of grilled rolled zucchini with sun-dried tomato and marinara. I woke up thinking about those! \u00a0They were a perfect example of the exquisite flavor pairings accomplished here, even in the smallest dish. Ribbon-thin slices of zucchini were wrapped around meaty strips of sun-dried tomato, then lightly grilled. The sliders were accompanied with a chopped and pickled vegetable slaw, similar to the Latin Escabeche. Perfect contrast the the creamy veal meatballs.Although I've not visited all of the small-plate, tapas places or enotecas in the city, Quartino is by far my first choice for this style of eating and drinking. The pizzas are simple and exquisite. The pastas you can order in half-orders, which is how they'd be eaten in Europe anyway. And the vegetarian dishes are worthy of a \"No Vegan Left Behind\" award.

This is where my native cousins suggested we go, and after looking at a few websites of other suggestions, I agreed. It was easy to find from the L even for this out-of-towner. We were seated upstairs, and I would say the only drawback of the evening was the noise level. It was very hard to hear each other. We started with drinks. I had their Limoncello Martini - Housemade Limoncello, Absolut Citron, Fresh Squeezed Mint Lemonade. I told the server I don't like fresh mint very much, so they used their plain lemonade instead and it was divine and got me just loopy enough. My husband tried the Orangecello Martini - Housemade Orangecello, Absolut Mandarin, Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. The kids had flavored Italian sodas. DD2 chose the lemon, and DD1 said \"surprise me\" and they brought her Passionfruit - which was unique and lightly sweet. Very refreshing. They also accidentally made a root beer flavored one, and left it for us to share, which was creamy and sparkling. yum!For dinner the 7 of us shared 2 rounds of food, tapas style...Round 1: a cheese plate - Acadamia Barilla Pecorino Dolce Sardinian - Sheep's Milk, Butter, Honey, Semi-Hard served with a fruit/nut bread and persimmon spread. Who has persimmon spread?! We had Gnocchi - \u00a0house made Potato Dumplings, Green Beans, Potatoes, Arugula Pesto & Pork Stock. It was covered in pesto, very green but not too strong in flavor. Even my husband who abhors green beans picked around them and loved this. He probably could have asked them to leave the green beans off, but he didn't. I would have added more garlic. I hit was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo Tuscan - house made Pasta Ribbons which were light and delicate with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce. There were shreds of the beef in the sauce. The serve this with parmesan on top, which was not on the menu and my daughter does not like, so we asked for a 2nd order without parm, which they did gladly. They probably should just have parm on the table instead.Roasted Baby Octopus - Braised Escarole, Red Chili, & E.V.O.O. - my cousin knew to ask for little red chili, I guess she'd been burned before. I did not touch this, but my DD1 loved it! My husband added Crisp Calamari in Organic Tomato Sauce, but I only tried one piece of that. Not chewy at all.Round 2 included more the 2nd pasta ribbons without the parm, Asparagus Risotto - which was delicious but seemed like a very small portion. The texture and creaminess were delightful. Penne alla Vodka - Vodka, Tomatoes, Garlic, Red Chili, Basil, & Cream - YUM! and the Tortellini in Alfredo Sauce, Peas & we asked for the Prosciutto on a separate plate because not everyone would eat that. The server was friendly and attentive, and waitstaff cleared small plates out of the way repeatedly. Water was served in a glass bottle on the table so we could refill easily. The bread on the table was boring, but I didn't eat it anyway because of all the great food. Plates come from the kitchen as they are ready, not all at once, but that is traditional tapas style, and then you know it is hot and fresh. In the end we did not take advantage of the gelato, but had dessert elsewhere. They were able to split our check with 3 different amounts on 3 different credit cards without hesitation. The view from our table was nice too! It's kind of rustic decor, and the servers have jersey-style tops, so that keeps the tone casual, which is good since you have to scream into your neighbor's ear quite a bit. Like I said, that was the only drawback. We also said it was my birthday, and I thought maybe a scoop of gelato with a candle would appear, but it did not. We arrived with 4 and little by little ended up with a table of 7, and they seated us when we were 4, which Chicago does not often do. Originally the reservation was for 8 and we changed it to 6 that morning, and they accommodated that as well. My cousins also took advantage of the valet parking which was quick, but I don't know what it cost them.Here is the WEIRD part - in the ladies room by the sinks is a wall of glass block, which overlooks the mens room. I was in there and thought I saw a male restroom attendant, but my daughter swears when she was in there the attendant was gone and you were looking at the urinals while washing your hands, and a man on the other side looked at her in shock and turned a little away while still trying to \"keep his aim\".

And any restaurant that can handle a group of 15 people on a Saturday night during restaurant week and make us feel like we were the only table in the place gets extra props.Must eat: sausage rissoto, gnocci, eggplant parmesan, pizza [its all good], garlic shrimp, fondueIf you are in the mood for desert definitely go with the italian donuts with both sauces [caramel and chocolate]Whatever you do, get to this restaurant immediately.

It's my go-to place because it's consistently great, from the food to the service to the price to the energy; I don't think you can go wrong. A few personal favorites are the cheese plate appetizer (get the eggplant, beet salad and duck prosciutto), orecchiette with lamb ragu, octopus, cavatappi, and the zeppele donuts.

I'm a fantastic sharer in most everything except sharing what's on my plate.

As others described, it is small plate and I would suggest \u00a0two plates per person. You get the most bang for your buck with a pizza which I've had both times. I like that they let you get half and half on a pizza with no additional charge. (I got half a pizza that was $12 and half that was $10 and paid $11). To be honest though, I tried the pepperoni yesterday and thought it was a little too greasy. While pepperoni is usually a staple of my diet, I would suggest being a little more adventurous here (such as the Soprano with Veal meatballs and giardinera.).The bread is very fresh, served with oil and parmesan cheese that you grate yourself at the table. Both times I ordered may favorite appetizer, calamari, which was amazing. Don't be fooled when they refer to it as a \"small plate\". It is the same size as you would expect at any other restaurant when you order it as an appetizer. Yesterday I order the ravioli and tortellini which were excellent, and the time before I had the shrimp risotto and the vodka pasta. Most the dishes looked great so while I would recommend any of these four, I'll probably try a different two next time. As an added bonus when I went yesterday, there is outdoor seating right on State Street which is great for people watching. \u00a0I noticed some other reviews complained about the noise level inside (which may have been an issue last time, I remember it being really crowded inside) so sitting outside solves this problem as well.", "Date": "2011-06-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Steve N.", "ReviewID": "VS0SpFjpMP_hky17t1f3RQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Walked in on a busy Saturday night and our party of 3 was seated immediately.

The first thing I must commend Quartino on is the ambiance; it's cozy yet lively at the same time.We had the caprese salad and the pickled artichoke hearts arrive at the same time, both cold dishes. \u00a0This was a perfect way to start the meal because both flavors were so different from each other yet very complimentary. The caprese salad had a sweeter taste with its balsamic vinaigrette in comparison to the tangier artichoke dish.We then moved onto the eggplant parmesan and the polenta fries. The eggplant was great. It didn't have the overkill of sauce that you usually find when you go to your average Italian restaurant, the eggplant had a slightly smokey flavor to it and the cheese was just enough. Overall this dish fulfilled my appetite without making me feel like I was going to have a coronary.The polenta fries. Now this is special. The fries are great...what makes it great is the sauce that comes with it: a thick, red pepper sauce for dipping.My boyfriend and I loved dinner so much, we opted for coffee and dessert.

We had heard good things about it and decided to see for ourselves. First of all, make reservations. This place was packed. Even with reservations it still took a few minutes to seat four adults (and my young grandson), but that's OK. Crappy restaurants aren't crowded, so that's actually a good sign. If you're driving, use the valet service. It isn't much, about 12 bucks and it was worth it. There's really no public parking around, especially during Christmas shopping season. Cab fare would have been higher and would have been a double expense to and from, we had the baby as well, so valet was the right choice for us.We were seated and met by Alyssia, our server. She immediately established that it was our first visit and explained how the tapas/small plate style worked. She went over the menu and took our drink orders. Within minutes, drinks were served. She even brought an extra wine glass in case I changed my mind (I rarely drink). Alyssia answered several questions about different dishes and once we decided, she was off and running. First to arrive were the veal meatball sliders. Big hefty meatballs, I'd guess about 1 1/2 to 2 oz each, on small buns with pomodoro sauce and giardiniera. There was a cheese on there as well but I'm not sure what type, didn't ask. Veal was very tasty, could have used a little more seasoning for me, but it was very good still. Within a few minutes, and the next dish was dates wrapped in pancetta, stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce & drizzled with honey. Holy cow, that was wonderful. The sweet and the savory of the gorgonzola with the sweet of the honey and the pancetta just can't be described, you simply have to try it. Everyone loved them and we seriously thought about ordering more but there was so much more food coming, we reluctantly passed. Next up was the Pappardelle al sugo di manzo, beef with pappardelle pasta in a tomato sauce. Very good and filling, little bit of heat on the back end. Just right for a chilly night.Next, the only low note of the evening. The rest of the group wanted a pizza, I wanted some veggies. We settled on Quattro Stagioni, a pizza with marinated artichokes, portobellos, roasted peppers, zucchini, and grana. I had asked Alyssia if I could get some of the same veggies on the side for me, she said sure, no problem. Well, the kitchen goofed it up and put all the veggies on the side and none on the pizza, so we basically had a cheese pizza. Most of the food was being delivered by a different server each time, so when Alyssia came around and saw what had happened, she disappeared for a moment and when she returned, told us that she had taken care of it and taken the pizza off our bill. Now that's damn good service!Last up was gnocchi. I have to admit, I didn't try it; I was nearing my limit by this time. It's made with green beans, potatoes, arugula, pesto and pork stock; it's not your average gnocchi. But everyone else loved it. Alyssia came around with the dessert menu. She let on that there was tiramisu that wasn't on the menu. I was trying to be good, my wife and I were going to split a dessert, a Panino al Gelato Limone, a lemon cream gelato sandwich with lemon curd, and whipped cream. The others had ordered a Nutella Panino, which is just what it sounds like, toasted panini with nutella. What I had missed was a wink and a nudge between my wife and Alyssia, the next thing I know we had the lemon panino, the nutella panino and the tiramisu. To top it all off, Alyssia said that she'd seen how I had perked up at \u00a0the mention of tiramisu, even though she had already scrubbed the pizza, she wanted us to be completely happy, she comped all three desserts! Is that awesome or what? Besides being a top notch server, hustling back and forth all evening as well as waiting several other tables, Alyssia really knocked it out of the park that night. Friendly, cheerful, and absolutely has the diners interest at heart, she made the night for us. My son picked up the tab for the meal and was certainly generous to Alyssia for her service and I gave her a little extra on the side as well. She certainly earned it; we also gave her an attaboy with her manager before leaving. I hope they darn well appreciate what they have in her. Overall, the food was outstanding. Everything was nicely done, the veal was moist and a good starting point, the pancetta dates were killer; the pappardelle was delicious, little hiccup on the pizza and veggies but it was saved by outstanding service. BTW, the veggies were great, should have got more of those as well. Gnocchi was super by all accounts. I can personally attest to to the tiramisu and the lemon panino as being worth the trip all by themselves. A wonderful meal and service that can't be beat anywhere.

Nothing has ever been bad but nothing has been fantastic either. Last time we had the marrow, which was very good but they seemed to have taken that off the menu. This time I had the duck prosciutto pizza with arugula. The duck prosciutto is really good but there wasn't very much of it on the pizza. In my head I was expecting a white sauce and some cheese on it but maybe I didn't read the menu well enough because it was a red sauce, which just didn't work. It would be a great pizza if they put more imagination into it. As it was, it just tomato sauce on pizza dough with a bunch of arugula on top. My husband had linguini and clam sauce--pretty spicy--but not outstanding.One big negative besides the average food is that nothing comes out of the kitchen together. I know this is supposed to be family style but I personally think it's the mark of a weak kitchen staff that there is so much time in between dishes. I mean, the small bowl of linguini and clams really isn't a sharing type of dish.", "Date": "2012-12-31", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Leila T.", "ReviewID": "Z0MpucWDEQ-KVO1HHOlO3w", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a huge disappointment!!! I have been to one other tapas restaurant (Cafe Babareeba in Lincoln Park) and even though they are different styles of cuisine I had my hopes set high for Quartinos solely because Cafe Babareeba was SO good. But unfortunately all tapas restaurants are not made the same.Prosciutto wrapped dates - yuck! The dates were way too small, couldn't even taste the prosciutto, the honey was extremely overpowering, and the blue cheese only enhanced the sweet flavor. Way too sweet. We were given 6 little portion sizes and could not finish it because of the sweetness. The bacon wrapped dates at Cafe Babareeba were absolutely amazing but these were not even comparable.Grilled baby octopus - another disappointment. Cold, extremely chewy, no flavor. Nothing special at all.Mushroom risotto - this was decent but something that I could easily make at home. Nothing to rave about.Mushroom tomato pizza - this was another extremely sweet dish. I'm not sure if it was from the tomatoes but it was overly sweet. The texture of the mushrooms were just weird. Not good at all. It was a very odd dish, we were just confused about the flavored and textures because they did not play well together.Do yourself a favor and go to Cafe Babareeba, even though it is Spanish tapas and Quartinos is Italian tapas, you will have a MUCH better meal at Cafe Babareeba.", "Date": "2013-06-29", "Author_Location": "Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mendel K.", "ReviewID": "rf27DZbNFSEWVuAN8uOPlQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice and approachable upscale italian restaurant. \u00a0As you walk on State street, just look for the neon wine bottle. \u00a0This restaurant has a large selection of wine, friendly wait staff, and a fun old-school upscale italian vibe. \u00a0Definitely check this place out for a group gathering, solo, or for a date night. \u00a0A+ for ambiance.", "Date": "2013-06-29", "Author_Location": "Iowa City, IA"}, {"Author": "Jared W.", "ReviewID": "e63u2UNDKZ8_u7wlOuJFsg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quartino is an amazing restaurant.The food is as good as it gets for someone who knows his food; but isn't quite a critic.However, the service is amazing.

It is a great restaurant for either kind of occasion. I highly recommend the $25 antipasto platter. It is plenty of food for two people, and you get to sample delicious cheeses, meats, olives and vegetable plates for an affordable price. The apricot puree that you dip the cheeses in is out of this world. The Stefano pizza is quite delicious, as I love rosemary. The Pasta a la Vodka has a great kick to it and is a favorite. Last but not least, the Zepolle (fried Italian donuts), are delicious, and with honey or dark chocolate, a great dessert to share with a few people. The plates come in full or half sizes, so it is easy to customize your meal, and to try lots of different flavors.The atmosphere is classy, fun, and suitable for \"fancy nights\" or casual dining. The service each time I was here was impeccable. Ty was a wonderful waiter, and was extremely helpful. He even brought our family a half-size of a dessert that he knew we would not finish, to save us on our bill and our stomachs! He deserves a raise, whatever he is making. The other waiter that I had (I can't remember his name, unfortunately), was extremely accommodating, and didn't make my boyfriend and I feel bad for ordering a limited amount of items (college budgets are the worst!) After finding out that we attended the college that he graduated from, he took our drinks off of our bill! Those kind gestures go a long way. Overall, Quartino has its service down to a T, and the food is excellent for the affordable prices.

Oh, and for the cheap wines measured by fractions of a litre. I enjoyed the casual ambiance and European feel of the space, down to the tiny tables and glasses. As far as the food and wine goes though, all I can say is that I've had much better Italian.Everything is served tapas style here, or small plates meant to be shared according to our server. Prices are quite affordable as well, definitely much cheaper than most other restaurants in the neighborhood. The bf and I had the white bean & garlic bread (per my request), polenta fries (per his request), sicilian eggplant caponata, and shrimp with garlic, chili and lemon. I liked the caponata as I do most well marinated, acidic eggplant caponatas, but found it to be a tad oily after a few bites. The white bean spread was pretty good as well, creamy and relatively light with just a drizzle of olive oil, but could have benefited from a little salt. However I did like the nicely grilled filone toast served with the white bean spread, much better than the complimentary stale bread given to us before our meal. The shrimp dish teetered on the small side, but was probably the most successful dish we had in terms of flavor and execution; the large shrimps were cooked nicely, and the sauce of garlic, lemon, olive oil, pinot grigio and chili was simple but very good. The polenta fries failed to impress me, as I found it to be way too dense and almost tough. I also found the red pepper salsa dipping sauce on the side to be strange - almost reminiscent of a sweet & sour sauce served at Chinese takeout joints. The bf, being the crazy polenta feign that he is, liked the polenta fries for the most part, but had to sprinkle salt over it himself. Overall it seems like Quartino underseasons their food across the board, which is pretty unexpected from an Italian restaurant if you ask me.Besides the just so-so food, I wish that I could speak more highly of their well-priced wines. Unfortunately though, I think the quality of the white wine we had kind of reflects the low price tag. Perhaps I shouldn't have experimented with ordering a chardonnay/pinot grigio blend, but it really just tasted kind of sour and cheap to me.That said, I still think Quartino is still a pretty good place if you're around Magnificent Mile and want a relaxing, no-fuss place to grab a light bite.

Pears were at least naturally sweet from being ripe, and the simple olive oil-lemon dressing really made the dish light.*Prosciutto D'Anitra pizza: Would have appreciated a thinner crust with more char on it (ie. brick oven/wood fired crust.) Arugula was a perfect spicy accent to the sweetness of the caramelized onions.*Gnocchi: Wished it was more pillow-like in texture rather than tough. Pesto tasted incredibly fresh and bright though, and the green beans were an interesting choice.*Beef fillets: Fav dish of the night because they were cooked perfectly at medium rare.*Fondue: Can't go wrong with a bowl of melted dark chocolate and sweet ripened strawberries.

The dessert, a nutella panino, was just absolutely terrific and was matched perfectly with their cappucino.My only negatives- first, very minor- what's up with the low awning by the front door? I'm 6'3 and had to duck WAY under it to get in. Not very welcoming to us tall chaps! :) Second, and more of an annoyance- the three of us were seated at a very small round table, leaving very little room for placing plates on the table- at a restaurant predicated on sharing, this seemed a awfully ill-conceived. Also, because we were close to the kitchen, I was bumped and brushed by servers and bussers all evening. I accidentally elbowed a busser and felt awful about it. We adjusted the table and I pulled in my chair as close as I could to minimize the problem but with little relief.

It emphasizes itself as a pizzeria and a wine bar, and they serve many of their dishes in smaller appetizer portions. You can then try many different items, just like the way we did at the recent Yelp party. The thin crust pizzas are delicious, with crispy crusts and without an overload of toppings. The pizza slices were clearly the hit of the evening, and anyone who digs thin crust should order a pizza or two here (they're not that large - again \"smaller\" portions). There were also some bruschetta-like items with tempting toppings like sun-dried tomatoes and portobello mushrooms, though they overwhelmed the bread into a semi-soggy state. I imagine Quartino prepared a lot of these items for the 150+ crowd, so they may have sat for a bit. I am sure the bread will stand up a bit better if you order directly from the menu. We also enjoyed meatballs and polenta fries (a look-alike for mozzarella sticks) for this fine appetizer buffet. The cocktail special was a bellini, a peachy-champagney mix which was interesting but a bit sweet for others. Every employee at Quartino seemed to be efficient, pleasant, or a combination of both. I would love to come back to Quartino for a real meal sometime soon.Give a 21-Yelp salute to Andrea and Elizabeth for setting up this swell soiree at Quartino.

We had a group of 5 and decided to check this place out because of all of the wonderful feedback that you guys posted and I'm so glad that we did!! Don't be fooled by the appearance when you first walk in because this place can definitely pack A LOT of people! We arrived at this place around 7ish on Wednesday night for dinner and waited about 20 minutes for a table. They were really busy and we were literally drooling when we saw the amazing food on everyone's table. They have 2 bars (upstairs/downstairs) and an extensive wine list at reasonable prices. The decor is really cute and we felt very cozy. Our table was near the back corner so we felt very snug in our group even though the place was very loud! For Food Dishes, we ordered the following items: 1. Grilled baby octopus - I thought the dish was good if you like octopus. I'm not a super big fan of octopus, but it was flavorful and the veggies gave it a nice touch. 2. Steamed Clams - Very good! Highly recommended if you like clams. They give you a pretty large portion and the broth that they steam it with is very flavorful and delicious!! 3. Quattro Stagion - Vegetable Pizza - The pizza was thin crust and a lot bigger than what I would expect for a tapas joint. I thought it was OK, but I was actually really stuffed so I only had about 1/2 a slice. It sounds a lot more tasty on the menu then what we actually got. 4. Penne alla vodka with sausage - Delicious Delicious dish! I'm so glad that we added the sausage which gave this pasta a really good flavor. Be warned that there were some parts of the dish that had more concentration of vodka, but it was soooo good! I highly recommend this one too! 5. Pappardelle con Cavolfiori - Mehhhh... nobody in our group really liked this dish. The noodles are very large and thick and the sauce base had a thick consistency. They only gave a little bit of walnuts and apples and at the end of the night, the waiter saw that we barely touched the dish. When we confessed that we didn't really like it, he ended up taking it off the bill! Isn't that awesome?!! :) 6. Mushroom Risotto - Love this dish!! It's really creamy and the rice is not too mushy. Lots of mushrooms in here and just really addicting! I think I could finish off the whole plate myself :X 7. Caprese - I thought the cheese was really milky for my taste buds. I mean, I love cheese, but I didn't care too much for this one. Also, I thought they were a little skimpy on the vinaigrette. I probably wouldn't get this again. 8. Crispy Calamari - Pretty darn good calamari. Very crispy and flavorful as well! I didn't even need to add sauce!! Yum.... Wines: 1. Pinot Grigio - Pinot is pinot. Good wine :) 2. Rosso - I'm not big on red wine, but this one was light and went well with our food and super cheap! Dessert 1. Coppa al banana - Generous portions of vanilla ice cream with biscotti and caramelized banana. The biscotti was a little bit chewy and not what you would normally expect, however I really liked and it was a great treat to end our dinner! Overall I loved 4 out of the 8 dishes that we got and the dessert was kick ass! I wish I lived in Chicago so that I could try the other stuff out... but I'm sure I'll be in the windy city again!

Subsequently, Audrey assumed the role of Foodmander & Chief and made the executive decision to go to Quartino. \u00a0We put our name in for a table of four on their outdoor patio and were told the wait would be 25 minutes. \u00a0Just as we received our bottle of wine inside at the bar, our table was ready! \u00a0Wow, a table ready in less than the time quoted. \u00a0A mini miracle to start our dining experience...Quartino is part of the small plate movement and encourages you to order 2 to 3 plates per person and SHARE. \u00a0As you know I HATE sharing and so does Jono's wife Lisa. This should be interesting. \u00a0We started off with their build your own Salumera Tasting. We opted for Duck Prosciutto, Soppressata, Parmesan Reggiano, Fontina, Calamari Salad, Roasted Beet Salad, and the Siclian Caponata. \u00a0The tasting also came with a selection of olives and all the fixings for the meat and cheeses. \u00a0To the selection we also added a side order of Prosciutto di Parma. Everything was delicious! \u00a0The house cured Duck Prosciutto was the clear gold medal winner, but every other component somehow made it to the podium (Sorry for the Olympics reference, but how can't you get caught up in all this hoopla?). \u00a0Next we had the Eggplant Parmigiano which had great flavors, but was salted very heavily. If I think something's too salty than something is wrong. \u00a0 \u00a0The Margherita Pizza was also a bit of a letdown. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, it was a good pizza, but when I think Margherita I think fresh buffalo mozzarella, not shredded mozzarella. \u00a0We also shared the Tortellini with Alfredo Sauce, Peas, and Prosciutto, which was good. \u00a0I went off on my own and ordered the Veal Meatball Slider, which may have been the best dish of the night. The meatball is perfectly spiced and it's served with yummy pickled vegetables. \u00a0To wash it all down we ordered a $16 liter of Antica Osteria Bianco, which for the money was perfect for an outdoor summer night.Quartino's outdoor patio is among the city's best. \u00a0Substantial marble tables and nice comfortable chairs make it a bit nicer than most. However, the street noise can be a bit much. \u00a0I mean do ambulances really need to have their sirens so loud? \u00a0The service was good, but not great. There were a couple of opportunities for our server to go the extra mile, but maybe didn't recognize it. No big deal. \u00a0As we were eating I was excited to give Quartino 4 stars. \u00a0However, as I am writing this review the salty eggplant parm we had is actually making me thirsty. And now I'm thinking about the disappearance of the fresh mozzarella on the pizza. \u00a0So for now Quartino will have to settle for 3 stars.

The broccoli was basic and disappointing, could've used more garlic. We were hungry for pizza, sadly it was one of the worst we've had in a long time. Seemed undercooked to me, which looked like how they did them, and an awful combo of bland gardiniera that hardly resembled the quattro stagiono we expected. I make better pizzas at home, quite a disappointment. The GM was attentive and swooped in to check on us and offered to get another pie or take it off the tab.

The restaurant serves smaller portions of entrees that are available to share if you have a large party. Be sure to get a reservation or be prepared to wait a long time for a table during dinner hours. A quick review of our meal:1. Margherita pizza- thin crust variety home made mozzarella and sweet basil leaf makes for a great sharing dish2. Dates wrapped in pancetta- small appetizer dish perfect with wine3. House bread- great with olive oil and parmesean cheese from the grater (unlike other restaurants this is the real deal in your own personal grater)4. Fettuccini- fresh made fettuccini pasta cooked perfectly in a white sauce5. Tortellini- thin slices of proscuitto bring out the tortellini. No complaints here6. Linguini with clams- this is one of the highlight dishes with perfectly cooked linguini slightly above al dente with a few clams complimented by a white or red sauce. 7. Penne alla vodka- can't really taste the vodka, an okay dish8. Rigatoni- a few chicken chunks that were slightly over cook detracted from this dish9. Shrimp risotto- shrimp were not overcooked and a healthy amount of cheese holds the dish together well10. Sauteed spinach- over-rated and over priced. spinach with garlic and oil.. Blah11. Beef short ribs- fall off the bone tissue with a nice salsa verde12. Beef filets- amazing, so small though the piece of beef. perfectly cooked filet mignon13. Gran Coppa Quartino- expensive, but if you like gelato and biscotti with hazelnut this is the dessert for you. Has all three gelato flavors14. Fantasia Coppa di Frutta- equally as expensive as above but with all flavors of sorbet15. Panino al Gelato Limone - very soft lemon gelato sandwich16. Zeppole - Great dish to share, inexpensive. Italian donuts with chocolate or honey. fyi they charge extra if you select bothNEGATIVE POINTS- Candle in the middle of the table dripped wax all over our cups- Server did not ask about honey or chocolate with the zeppole and ended up charging us- Server did not inform a party member that there was no refills on the lemonade. we ended up spending 20 dollars on lemonade- After spending 450 dollars on this meal we still barely safe our server.

After checking out the menu online (and drooling) my fiance and I decided to make an impromptu trip here after work on Friday. We arrived at 6 without a reservation and were seated immediately. The second we sat down, two hands came out of nowhere, one from the left with water and one from the right with bread. Our waiter explained the menu to use and offered samples of the wine. We ended up with the cheapest red (hey we're saving for a wedding) which was pretty tasty. We started with the duck proscuitto which was yummy, if a bit fatty (but duck is) for my taste, and the taleggio cheese, which was good but probably unneccessary since we were also planning on the fonduta. The fonduta was fantastic - light and creamy, not heavy like most fondues. Our bowl of bread was replenished without us asking. \u00a0At this point we were through with one 1/2 liter of wine and on our way to full and tipsy. We decided to not go overboard and just ordered the meatballs and the polenta fries to share, and another 1/2 liter of wine. I really wanted the pesto gnocchi but I knew it would be too much (next time). The polenta fries were good, but I was expecting them to be better. The meatballs were fantastic, and I usually am not that big \u00a0a fan of meatballs. After all that, we still couldn't resist dessert. Profiteroles (excellent, depsite the topping of almonds) and lemnocello for him and some lambrusco and the nutella panini for me (heavenly, and so simple - just bread and nutella!). We ended up spening $70 for a ridiculous amount of wine, some meat and cheese, fondu, meat and starch, 2 desserts and 2 \u00a0after-dinner drinks. And we ended up taking home half of the fries, meatballs, and nutella panini to eat later!I loved the fact that the liter is double the cost of the 1/2 liter, which is double the cost of the 1/4 liter. It make me feel like if I am going to end up drinking a whole liter, I don't need to decide that now. It's not like you save money buy ordering more upfront. Yes, it was loud, but we didn't mind. The only sour note came at the end, when they started clearing everything away and we felt rushed to leave (though we had been there over 2 hours and there was a line out the door). Our server came and took the signed credit card slip off the table while we were stlll sitting there, which I absolutely hate. Overall it was fantastic and I can't wait to come back!- - - Update 7/30 - Came back with two friends. We again had the fonduta and the meatballs (amazing again) but also branched out to try the fettucine (okay) caprese salad (yummy) and asparagus risotto (oh my god - so good).

The food here is serve as \"small plates\" which are meant to be shared and which is a great way to eat because it allows you to try so many things and to share with your companions. My wife and I shared three items and loved each. My favorite vegetable in the world is, well, all of them, but the best is asparagus, so I ordered the asparagus risotto and was very happy with that choice--truly excellent. The \"Crispy Calamari\" (they also offer another variety of calamari) was also great--lightly battered, plentiful and delicious. We topped these off with a veal skirt steak which was also very good.My only complaint is the tiny, tiny table we had to use to manage all this. We were warned before we were seated that it was a small table, but this table was no bigger than a serving tray with legs \u00a0and on it were the oil and vinegar, the salt and pepper, a stack of extra dishes, a little metal stand for holding a pizza, the bottle of water, the drinks we ordered, the three food plates, the silverware, and the plates we ate from.

The long review:We went out with a small group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we made a reservation for 6:30 for a party of six on a Friday. The restaurant was insanely busy and there was already a line of people waiting, which made me relieved that we had a reservation. We ended up being seated on the second floor near one of the kitchens. The atmosphere was extremely loud, and I could barely hear the other people at the table, as everyone in the restaurant was yelling at one another. I would not recommend this for an intimate date, or any sort of dinner where you value conversation.Now, onto the service. The service was extremely lacking. It took about 10 minutes for our server to approach our table, and she didn't really offer up any recommendations or suggestions. She disappeared for awhile, and then some random guy (the owner? manager?) came up to our table and took our drink order on a grubby piece of paper and then just left. Another waiter/server came out and served us our drinks, which also seemed bizarre. Luckily, our waitress came back and we put in our food orders, and she was able to answer a few questions we had about the menu and how much food to order. Our table seemed confused by the fact that the menu is \"family style\" and \"small plates\". Many people ordered too little food and complained of the portion sizes as \"family style\" and \"small plates\" are conflicting terms. My boyfriend and I have been to many tapas bars and small plate restaurants, so we anticipated the way the meal would be served. I think it would be fair to mention that you could go to almost any other restaurant and order an entree per person and share with your entire party and there would be significantly more food for a much lower price. Regardless, people still seemed hungry after ordering an entree per person, but no one wanted to foot a higher bill.As for the food, I seem to be missing something based on the other Yelp reviews. \u00a0The duck prosciutto was... lacking. We were served a measly 2 ounces of meat that was over salted and lacking in duck taste. I kept on pairing it with varying amounts of the sauce/jam on the side and that just made it taste worse. I really, really wanted to like this, as I haven't seen it on a menu before, but it was just terrible. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Next, my boyfriend and I split the Caprese salad. It was pretty standard--nothing amazing, nothing terrible. Lastly, we split the beef short rib which was one short rib. The meat was extremely tender and fell of the bone, and the sauce greatly accentuated the meat. This is the one item I would recommend that everyone try if they dare venture to this restaurant.The other people in our party split a plate of Vodka Pasta which looked pretty standard, and the four people each had a large spoonful of pasta. They also split the grilled calamari which disappeared quickly, so I'm assuming they liked it. For their main entree, they split a pepperoni pizza which was about the size of a medium Dominos pizza, and they each got 2 pieces. They all said it was good, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The other people in our party tried two of the desserts (the banana split and the profiteroles) and they were large portions and looked good. I didn't try them so I can't comment on it!All in all, I'll never visit this restaurant again, as I feel that your money can be much better spent at any of the other culinary meccas in Chicago.

We started with a bottle of their house wine, which is a tasty, light, fruity red; and at $15 a bottle, it's a steal (consider most restaurants will charge $30 for something like this). Ordered a sausage pizza, wasn't very impressive but I give it a 7 on a 1-10 scale; \u00a0the Prosciutto di Parma was very delicious, served with sweet cucumbers; for our entrees, we ordered the Cavatelli, which is one of their homemade pastas, cooked in tomato sauce, with fresh basil and Ricotta cheese; the roasted salmon; and the Vodka Penne.

\u00a0This place is beautiful and located in the heart of the city. \u00a0You walk in to classic design and within moments are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the crowd. \u00a0And I'm not joking when I say this place is as loud as some concerts I've been to. \u00a0We had to wait a few minutes in the crowded, noisy foyer, then were led upstairs to our table. \u00a0The upstairs is beautiful, but it felt like we just stepped on the field at a bears game, complete with the roar of the crowd. \u00a0My headache began to throb, \u00a0There must have been 40 women in the room at different tables, all of them cackling and shouting to be heard over the roar of the crowd and the others at their tables that were screeching inane stories about lotion. \u00a0The noise did get slightly better after 10 pm, but was unbearable. \u00a0The restaurant played vaccuous trance in the background. \u00a0Yuck.The Food:Here's the deal, tapas is an awesome concept. \u00a0The spanish do this with much success with a combination of (usually) exceptional small plates of food that run from $5-$10, \u00a0Everyone shares and everyone gets to try something different. \u00a0Italian food, however, does not translate well when you charge ridiculous amounts of money for small portions of underwhelmingly average food. \u00a0We ordered a braised lamb shank for (if I recall) close to $20, \u00a0After I ate the approximately 2 ounces of tender, poorly seasoned, meat, I found myself giggling at the idea that I could have had 5 times the meat for the same money at a nicer, quieter, more relaxed fine dining establishment. \u00a0The Asparagus Risotto was bland and decidedly missing salt, pepper, flavor.... \u00a0It was about 1/2 a cup of Risotto and cost us $14 (maybe it was $12, close enough). \u00a0 \u00a0We ordered other stuff too, but none of it was what I would call reasonably priced or anywhere close to exceptional. \u00a0This concept COULD work if they made fantastic food and charged 30% less, but as it stands the food is ridiculously expensive and sadly mediocre.The Bill:We had 3 people. \u00a0Each of us had a cocktail and some food. \u00a0We were there for dinner, but none of us left feeling anything close to full. \u00a0Our tab, including tip, was $155. \u00a0For that money, the three of us could have enjoyed a fabulous meal at Wildfire (or Opera, or giocco, or bob chinns or froggy's or, well just about anywhere), walked out having enjoyed our conversations and feeling like gluttonous pigs.The staff:I've worked in restaurants for close to a decade (at least I used to in a former career). \u00a0You don't have to be very good when you don't have to bring out the food in order (they don't) or on time (they bring it whenever), and you don't have to be very good when your customers can't hear a word you say and you can't hear them either. \u00a0We resorted to hand signals for water refills and to answer what looked liked (i'm not very good at lip reading in the dark) 'Is everything okay?\" \u00a0The girl who served our table was nice enough (from her smile - I think she said thank you, but I couldn't tell). \u00a0I can't fault her. \u00a0I'm not terribly sure if I had the chance to hear her voice.Overall:Avoid. \u00a0Besides the crowd, this place is expensive and the food just isn't very good. \u00a0You can spend far less on tasty spansih tapas and enjoy a more reasonable atmosphere down the street at Iberico. \u00a0You can spend just a hair more and enjoy brazzaz or Fogo de Chao and feel like your money was well spent. \u00a0$12 tapas plates \u00a0that taste like the Olive Garden master chefs made it isn't enough to sell this place. \u00a0Why waste your money on below average food so you can sit in a room with your friends and be unable to converse due to crowd noise?I'm not only unimpressed with Quartino, I'm downright dissapointed. \u00a0The folks that gave this place great reviews need to try some other places. \u00a0I guarantee that you'll realize that your opinion was goofy.Now, had they served big plates for that money, I'd be saying that it was a reasonably placed, sort of generic eatery with mediocre food, but with little plates it makes the diner feel like a fool when the bill comes.", "Date": "2008-07-01", "Author_Location": "Wheeling, IL"}, {"Author": "Mark R.", "ReviewID": "hc_9d5-EVbjwJ0hYHsNAaQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not much else to say here that other Yelpers haven't said but I still feel a review is in order.

When I asked the hostess what the wait would be, she told me the dining room was sold out for the night. Sad face. It was cold, and we were tired so we decided to try our luck at the bar area since it was first come, first served. We spotted a couple in the back corner that appeared to be finishing up and camped out next to them in a polite I'm gonna stare at you and make you uncomfortable until you leave kind of way. Just to lock up the table, I asked them if we could have it when they were finished. Right after I did that, some girl says \"uh, I've been waiting for 30 min\" My response \"ok, well you're not even near the table so if any table opens up does it become yours just because you've been waiting for 30 min?\" Yo Chicago, I don't know how first come first served works in your town, but from where I'm from, the first to grab a table when it opens up gets it regardless if they haven't been waiting the longest. The girl didn't have a rebuttal and another spot opened up so it worked out anyway. \u00a0I don't go to a lot of tapas restaurants because I always feel like you end up spending a lot for not very much food.

Everything was delicious but the bone marrow and mushroom risotto really stood out. They were both perfectly cooked, rich, and full of flavor.

This was awesome and we could have easily eaten another plate. The tomatoes and seasonings in general on the skirt steak were great, but the meat wasn't really cooked like skirt steak should be. Kind of difficult to cut. However, in a large kitchen with small plates, we should have known better than to order an item like that.

Most people talk about the food in their yelp reviews. I could explain how phenomenal the Salumeria Tasting was and that although we sat right by the kitchen and about three bachelorette parties, we were too focused on our food and laughing to notice much else. But what stood out to me was the service and hospitality of Quartinos.Being in the industry, I understand the importance of making the customer enjoy every aspect of their experience- from walking into the door to signing the bill and waving goodbye. While we were finishing our last olives and slices of cheese, a server assistant sort of bumped into my dad's chair while he was carrying dishes back to the kitchen (no big deal, dad works in the industry, too, and wasn't bothered by it). Less than 30 seconds later, our sweet waitress had a shocked look on her face while she was standing behind my dad. Um... ma'am? Apparently the SA had spilt some melted ice cream on my dad's back during the run-in and she was quick to wipe it off my dad, then to clean up the floor around the table. I couldn't count how many times she asked if he was alright and how sorry she was. To make the experience more entertaining, she then offered to buy our dessert since someone else's had been spilt on us. Sweet. So we got our menus and began to look over. Then the manager came out and apologized as well, then gave us his card if we need anything (like therapy or a massage to deal with the stress of our meal).. Now that was unnecessary but really showed that they wanted to make sure we were happy customers and enjoyed the rest of our evening. I'm already in the neighborhood enough as it is, and I will be sure to be back as soon as I get another free weekend and hopefully a table on that heavenly patio opens up :)PS- SAVE ROOM FOR THE ITALIAN DONUTS.

Here's what we ordered: - Veal meatball slider: gosh the meat was dry. If it were not for the sauce and the fact I was really hungry, I don't think I could've managed to swallow it. -Dates wrapped in pancetta: average. But it wasn't too hot, tasted like the plate had been waiting at the kitchen to be picked up for at least 15 minutes. -Gnocchi: salty, salty, salty. One note, too salty. -Tagliatelle: the meat sauce was good, but after couple of bites, it went back to the salty taste. -Linguini with clam: the clams tasted fresh, the red sauce on the other hand, was very watery, and ha, salty! -Steamed clam: I know, two dishes with clams, but the in-laws said clams are good for liver after heavy drinking...No need to say, it's kinda salty. -Roasted baby octopus: the octopus was cooked very well, but for a $11 plate, there were only four tiny pieces on it. I was unhappy. -Italian donuts: after a very salty meal, I was glad to have something sweet. The donuts were fluffy, melt in your mouth, and dipped in honey and chocolate sauce was the best combo!

Holy cheese balls!I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was pretty packed! I'd describe the atmosphere as boisterous. The people were all enjoying themselves, so it was fairly loud. The tables are also packed in pretty close together. It's like everyone there is one big happy family! I found the restaurant to be clean and nicely decorated.We had to wait awhile for our waiter, twice. When he showed up he was nice enough though. We actually had two waiters, one of whom appeared for the first time halfway through the meal. He seemed nice as well. It didn't take long to get the food. Water glasses were refilled regularly, which is good. Running out of water is a major pet peeve of mine.They have a good selection of wines, and many of them are available in a variety of sizes: 1/4, 1/2 and full carafe and bottle. There are also a few available by the glass. Prices seem decent to me, but I'm far from a wine expert.The food, with one exception, was excellent. In case you haven't read any of the other 440+ reviews of this place yet, it's basically small-plate Italian. It's like an Italian tapas restaurant. Actually, I think most of the portions are larger than what you get at at a true tapas restaurant. For two of us we ordered a caprese salad, a pizza, a pasta and a risotto and we had too much food. We would have been fine with 3 dishes. The pasta (orchiette or something...I'm too lazy to look it up..it's the \"ear shaped stuff\". I know nothing says \"tasty\" like munching on some ears) was delicious, as was the Popeye pizza, which was loaded with baby spinach. I left feeling stronger then ever, and ready to whip some Bluto ass! The caprese was good, though not the best I've had. The mushroom risotto was a bit of a disappointment. It was kind of just a big brown goopy mass. \u00a0. . you could hardly tell there was any risotto in it.

It's almost becoming a tired concept - too many places serve the same mediocre, overpriced-for-their-size flatbreads and calamari, vaguely attuned to whatever ethnic cuisine the establishment is trying to emulate. Quartino is not in this category; this place executes the concept flawlessly.Based on my experience, the food is uniformly fantastic. The prosciutto-wrapped dates are excellent; not remotely greasy or cloying (Chicago restauranteurs take note: dates are already sweet and do NOT need a superfluous honey glaze. Do them like this). The grilled octopus is fork-tender and simply seasoned. Bone marrow is copious and served with an appropriate amount of bread. Gnocchi with arugula pesto and green beans undoubtedly stole the show. I've seen enough of the played-out gnocchi offerings, served with gobs of bleu cheese or bland vodka cream sauce. This was a subtle twist on an authentic dish (Romans eat pesto with green beans and potatoes, which were represented by the gnocchi) - a welcome change of pace. I recommend you spring for fondue for dessert, which is also a pleasant surprise; very dark chocolate, melted just right, not a shade too thick or too thin. My lone pseudo-gripe is with the short rib, which tastes somewhat like the Italian potroast I make at home; by no means unpleasant, but it is somewhat offputting to be served food one feels one can make for oneself. Pricing was surprisingly fair for this typically extortionate neighborhood - most small plates set you back single digits, no small plate runs more than $13, and some of them (gnocchi, short rib) approach entree-size. Wine list is good and cheap, service is fast. All in all, Quartino bucks the trend of pedestrian, vaguely Mediterranean small plate establishments that are inundating the Chicago restaurant scene.

Mostly because my favorite Italian dishes I cook for myself. But given that whole octopus is hard to find, and I miss the ambiance occasionally, my wife indulged me and we gave Quartino a try. A restaurant in River North cannot help but be touristy, I understand that. And despite this, Quartino managed a certain amount of rustic charm endemic to a northern Italian trattoria. The kind where old retired men might play Briscola or Tressette on a warm summer afternoon while sipping house Chianti. However, one got the distinct impression they were trying to hard to make it quite so rustic. And it didn't help that it was roughly 4 times the size of an Italian trattoria, and way too tightly packed. It wasn't quite as bad as bumping elbows with our neighbours, but neither could we stretch out much. The tables were not large, and the staff kept the bread coming. The entrees were small, somewhere between tapas and a regular meal, which encouraged sharing, but made their price less palatable. The octopus was tasty, but not amazingly so. The roasted bone marrow was delicious, but not out of this world. And the caprese salad had the right ingredients, but the tomatoes were just short of mouthwatering. And while it wasn't obvious which wine to go with (and their list was quite nice), I went with the house Chianti, which left me feeling underwhelmed, even for the price.

My friend was in town from LA to celebrate her birthday and some other guests recommended Quartino. So one of the other people made a reservation for 10 people at 9pm. I was running late thinking it was no biggie. What they hadn't told the person who made the reservation was that they won't seat you without your full party. So my friend sent me a text to let me know that and I called the restaurant. They were pretty blase about the whole thing, despite me saying we weren't told, it was my friend's birthday, and I couldn't get there for 20 minutes. I had to spend the money on a taxi (plus an added $3 for atm charge) to get there. Then we had to wait more time once I arrived. Basically what happened is that they didn't have a table for us at all at 9. They could've easily pushed apart their 4 and 6 people tables to make two groups if they'd had one (because we ended up only having 6 people), but they just plain didn't have one for us at all. And when I called the guy was rude and said my party hadn't told him how many people were coming, despite the fact that they had indeed as soon as they got there. Or all he needed to do was count them and then add me, the person on the phone. But no. So my poor friends were stuck waiting for 30 minutes because of no table and the fact that they didn't mention the situation with every person having to be there. On the plus side, once we called them on what they'd done and they remembered I'd said it was my friend's Birthday we were there for, they comped us our first round of drinks (and told us as they were seating us that they would), which was $64 (we paid them back by each getting an $10-$12 drink). It was a nice gesture, but in no way made up for their table screw up. On to the food. Not traditional Italian at all and pretty small portions. I grew up half Italian and spent a lot of time eating at my little Italian grandmother's at the holidays. They tried to tell us it's an Italian thing to have small portions, but let me tell you, it most certainly is not. Not where my family is from at least. Prices were too high for the amount offered. At the end of the night, I ended up giving a tip of $11 despite not eating any of the food due to health issues. I spent $25 when I should have only spent around $7 ($2.25 red line fare and tip for the bellini I was comped). Ridiculous waste of time and money. Just beware if you go there that you MUST have *ALL* members of your party for them to seat you. And they probably won't tell you that up front either.

It's easily accessible and really well priced and the food is fantastic. A dinner for two, with a shared dessert comes to around $35 with tip.

Although I don't normally like sitting by the kitchen exit space, it is actually one of the quieter corners of the restaurant- They are known for \"family-style\" dining.

However, if you do find their portion to be small, it's cheap enough that you could order another entree easily. - They are great for groups and for kids. They make really accessible Italian food - especially their entrees. Their apps are meat/dairy place centered, which isn't my thing. \u00a0A lot of people go here for bachelor/ette parties or after work, so their staff is used to accommodating large groups of people.

When I informed her that it was the wrong entree and was allergic to eggplant she asked \"Oh... and exactly what happens when you eat eggplant?\" I told her what my usual symptoms would be and when she came back with the right entree she said \"Don't worry, this one doesn't have eggplant in it.\" In a highly sarcastic voice and then rolled her eyes before plopping the dish down. \u00a0It must have been love, but it's all over now.", "Date": "2009-12-19", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Joe Z.", "ReviewID": "-RKks9B4MdiVs0t8rhjjjw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this place. \u00a0There was so much potential when I walked in the door.Maybe it was the wedding reception taking place upstairs that made Quartino put extra tables in every possible nook and cranny downstairs. \u00a0It made what was a loud, energetic restaurant just impossibly loud and overcrowded. \u00a0We were sitting literally elbow to elbow with tables all around. \u00a0They were seating people in the entrance next to the doors. \u00a0I spent most of my dinner just waiting for a busboy or server to trip over me and spill something. \u00a0There were probably 2-3 close calls.You can say that anyone that puts up with that abuse gets what they deserve. \u00a0You could also argue that a restaurant willing to do that compels you to take your business elsewhere next time. \u00a0It bordered on utter contempt for the customer. \u00a0 The wait staff was overstressed, and the hordes of tourists and bachelorette parties and iPhone-hypnotized woo girls cramming this restaurant just didn't get the Chicago Italian Experience that they probably were expecting from this place. \u00a0I have no idea how anybody at those large tables could enjoy themselves when they couldn't hear the person sitting across from them. \u00a0I was just trying to get some more bread or a drink refill without having to flag someone down.Some of the dishes were very good. \u00a0Most were plain. \u00a0There are better places in the city, but don't fear for these guys. \u00a0They have a great formula and location. \u00a0I'm just saying if you know better and actually venture into the city more than once a year or once a bridal party, you'll do better", "Date": "2011-10-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Samir N.", "ReviewID": "Jhxb97USGYh9waFjUg8Yvw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love that they are open late with their tapas menu. \u00a0When we got in, I was stunned to see how ginormous the place was . . . but empty as we were approaching closing time. \u00a0That is a win for us. \u00a0The meatballs were definitely tender, but I thought could have used a bit more taste. \u00a0The bacon-wrapped dates were a nice combo of sweet and savory. \u00a0The lasagna, oh my, the lasagna - complete cheesy goodness.", "Date": "2012-07-29", "Author_Location": "Graz, Austria"}, {"Author": "Lora S.", "ReviewID": "ZFd37Holk9jDmHeCRrq25g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent food, fun, loud.

I ordered the penne ala vodka with mozzarella and a tortellini soup (vegetable base) and both were outstanding but because of the tapas sized portions, I wasn't really full (nor was I willing to share). I'd recommend getting soup, main dish, and a dessert if you like to feel full. Overall though, I was really satisfied. The service was also quite speedy and friendly.

Not terrible, but radicchio is awfully bitter. \u00a0And as much as I am complaining and bitching, the family style here wasn't too bad. \u00a0 \u00a0Not the best food I've had, but it was very good overall. \u00a0Pricing: 3 out of 5I'm torn on this one, because some things are so reasonably priced at Quartinos, and yet some things were not. \u00a0Example: the house wine they had was 12 dollars a bottle. \u00a0Yes, an entire bottle, and I've definitely had WORSE wine than their house wine. \u00a0But at the same time, a half carafe of bellini was 19. \u00a0The pizzas were all reasonably priced at 10 - 12 dollars. \u00a0No complaints there. \u00a0But some of the antipasto options were 4 - 5 dollars. \u00a0(granted, olives were about 2, which is fine, and I'm not saying that there weren't cheap tapas options, I'm just using the higher price point as a comparison). \u00a0I think the moral of the story is that if you study their menu prior to dining, you can definitely eat and drink for a reasonable price. \u00a0Let's assume 2 people are dining. \u00a0You could have a bottle of house wine (12 dollars), split a pizza (11 on average), have one or two tapas (2 - 4 dollars each) and maybe a dessert (5 - 6?). \u00a0At the same time you could easily double or triple what I just quoted. \u00a0It's really up to your dining tastes.Overall: 4 out of 5Final Word: \u00a0Worth a look if you have a large group of friends or want a nice romantic dinner. \u00a0They have an upstairs dining area that actually looked nicer than the downstairs, but this might have just been my personal preference. \u00a0I would NOT bring children to this restaurant, and I think they would have a harder time finding something delectable (to them). \u00a0The only thing I would question is their accessibility for people in wheelchairs. \u00a0Dining on the first level would be fine, but I did not see an elevator to go to the restrooms on the second floor. \u00a0Not saying it's not there. \u00a0I just didn't see it.", "Date": "2009-07-26", "Author_Location": "Milwaukee, WI"}, {"Author": "Leah C.", "ReviewID": "AaWpdExrKH2WXd-6VboHZw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "lemony goodness...i've been to quartino a handful of times since my last review and it's becoming one of my faves... the european atmosphere makes it inviting to lounge, sip and nibble... reminding us that we need to take it easy once in a while. \u00a0their $8 half carafe of rosso is decent - i even asked our server why it was so \"cheap\". \u00a0he replied that they cut a good deal with the distributor passing the savings onto us - score! \u00a0it's not the best but it's drinkable. \u00a0the broccoli rabe remains my fave dish, mainly because i just don't know how to cook through the bitterness of it at home. \u00a0but my latest discovery: LEMON GELATI PANINO = homemade lemon gelato sandwiched between 2 lemony pancakes served atop fresh lemon curd and topped with lemon cream and lemon chips! \u00a0TWO sandwiches come in one serving! \u00a0SO SO SO GOOD.", "Date": "2009-08-07", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Chirag P.", "ReviewID": "-gYcyKaYpqJ1f2kkYAxuXg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the concept of Italian style tapas, the dishes are great, but it's always packed and so even with a reservation we've had to wait at times. \u00a0Not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet dinner... so basically don't make this a first date place.

This is a good choice for your girls' night: They had plenty of seating to accommodate large parties and the family-style plating lends itself well to groups (and to sharing the check!).That said, when we arrived only 8 of the 9 of us were present; the 9th had been flying into Chicago and was delayed at least 20 minutes. The hostess refused to seat us until the entire party was available. While I think this is a stupid policy with a group this large (after all, they're still holding our huge table and we'd just be buying drinks if we were sitting there), my real problem was with the hostess' incredibly rude attitude. I went to explain the situation to her and she cut me off by saying \"It will be a while.\" and then turned to the other hostess to chat, essentially signaling our conversation was done. We ended up getting seated when an unexpected additional guest joined our group, making us the full 9; our now 10th member joined late and simply pulled up a chair. All told, we were not seated until 15 minutes past our reservation on a busy Saturday night even though we arrived on time because of the 1 missing person, and any of us who actually interacted with the hostess was in a foul mood after being treated like crap.Fortunately our waiter, Peter, was out of this world. He kept the food and drinks coming, provided helpful advice on what to order, and even conjured up a cream-puff-and-banana dessert for our bachelorette arranged to resemble a certain part of the male anatomy.Food ran the gamut from awesome (mushroom pizza, asparagus risotto, garlicky bone marrow) to meh (chili shrimp, margherita pizza). Most dishes needed some salt, in my opinion, although I noticed I was reaching for the salt shaker more than others.Prices were fantastic.

Hugo Ralli and Steve Lombardo, best known for their Chicago standards of Gibson's and Hugo's Frog Bar (reviews forthcoming), have entered into this hot new fray with Quartino, a challenger just a block away from the new Lettuce Entertain You enoteca, Osteria via Stato. Sadly, like many things Hugo and Steve do, this is more about show than substance, but especially so here. The tables are jammed together worse than your traditional kosher delis, with floors and walls that reflect sound everywhere, coupled with a fairly hip, arrogant, (and thus) loud crowd; in toto, it makes for a lousy dining experience. The waiters think they're funny with their pushy attitude; it simply doesn't work in this environment, coming off as almost boorish instead. The dishes were hit and miss in quality, more good than not (though nothing especially great), and forget about asking for anything done a certain way by the kitchen; it's clearly a production line that has a stock set of formulae and don't even bother trying to mess with it. Their marinated fare was perhaps their best; I had a housemade (or so claimed) giardinara that was kind of nice, and some of the dried meats seemed tasty enough. Like the patrons and the service, though, much of the food was brash, unsubtle, and overbearing. Example: sweet potato fries were big and overbreaded; tasty, but in a way that makes you go, \"okay, I get the point, stop shouting.\" The red pepper sauce that came with them was nearly identical.Their true win is the wine, and the fact that they named themselves after their wine presentation sort of shows at least they're aware of what they're hawking. Moderately priced choices of truly average wines abound, in carafes as small as the quartino so you can have many choices on the table. They serve the old style diner water glasses for you to take small pours from quartinos so you can get little tastes of just about everything your party orders (and I'm sure this encourages a sort of \"endless drinking\" concept that reflects well on the final tab). Since I tend to dine with highly discriminating wine enthusiasts, we found ourselves with a couple of quartinos of almost drinkable fermented grapes. I think one of my fellow diners would have labelled it as \"good for kids\" (meaning people my age and younger) but not worthy of a serious (think \"your parents' age\") wine drinker's time.After a Friday at Orchestra Hall, if I need a Ralli and Lombardo place to stop at for an early dinner (as was the old family tradition), it's going to be Hugo's, not this place. In fact, I don't think I'll ever go here again... unless I have some friends who are just in love with the place, and I don't care if I can hear what they are saying during dinner.Pros: Trendy, easy mix and match of food and wineCons: Loud, obnoxious, mediocre foodSummary: One of the more disappointing new Chicago enotecas if you actually care about the whole experience.", "Date": "2009-04-04", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Karen L.", "ReviewID": "KJQGJjf3yOCdDMY1ZmORhA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great place for good food and cheap prices!

A stack of small plates is conveniently provided and constantly switched out. Make sure your server knows if you're not done with your food yet because they are so efficient that I almost had my unfinished food taken away twice! HahaThe food comes whenever it's ready and bread is provided. Ask for balsamic vinegar to create the perfect dipping sauce with olive oil and pepper. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and never ending! Our spinach salad arrived first but it was disappointing. The thin sliced pear was amazing but sparse (or maybe I just wanted more because it was so good!). Spinach tasted a little off and warm like it was cooked. I think blue cheese would've been better than the cheese they had.Clam linguine was FANTASTIC. It's the type of dish that I would want to order again even though I like to try new dishes all the time. We had the marinara sauce which I doubted at first because marinara tends to be too thick and salty. The sauce at Quartino was definitely freshly made. It was the perfect combination of whatever marinara is made of, with a light sweetness. Thin slices of garlic were the perfect compliment to the clams.Then came the pizza. Get two different toppings half and half so you can try more toppings! We had the Quattro Stagioni (tomato, mozzarella, artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, mushrooms, and grana) and Pepperoni (neopolitan sausage, tomatoes, and mozzarella). The pepperoni was amazing to me, but the Quattro Stagioni was even better. So much flavor and if you're a cheese lover like me you'll be picking off the big pieces of grated cheese to eat on its own. And don't forget to order drinks. Sangria is only $4 and one of the best I've ever had! Sweet and doesn't taste like alcohol.About the service: Hostess recommended that we share food (great tip!). Waiter brought us a new pizza when it was actually my fault for ordering the wrong topping because there's two pizzas with similar names but they're completely different pizzas! And upon careful scrutiny we found zero traces of spit or any trace of an angry cook. Oh we were so happy! Then we ordered cappuccino with a shot of espresso but felt like it \u00a0wasn't strong enough so our waiter, David brought us a shot of espresso on the house!Btw, check out the restrooms. designed with an antique flair. Interesting soap choice. Also, if you're a classics movie fan, The Bicycle Thief plays on 4 televisions in the four corners of the restaurant.

The dining room is really crowded and tables are set so close together it probably only has room for your legs to move through. It's a loud dining room so if you want to go for a heart to heart talk and meal, this might not be the place. But, considering it was a saturday night in a packed house, the waiter was on it like no other. Trying to get refills on our waters was a little tough but the waiter was very prompt with ordering, delivering drinks, etc. This is a great place for a different kind of tapas...Italian style. We loved going to Iberico because of the spanish tapas and low prices, and I think Quartino really gives us an alternative to that - Italian family style dining for a decent price. They give you a sheet full of meats, cheeses, and olives where you can mark the amount of each you would like and it comes in a shared plate. The meats were pretty good but my Italian friend commented that one of the meats was \"not good\" to the waiter (the meat was really dry and appeared more like jerky than cured meat). That was all he said. The waiter immediately sent in another order with fresher slices and comped us both orders of that particular meat. We got a pizza bianca and the pizza was very deliciously baked fresh and flavors were well balanced. We also got the steamed clams, which were so so, nothing to write home about. The asparagus risotto was alright, it was tasty but again, nothing to write home about. I think we should have stuck with more main Italian dishes like gnocchi or more pizzas since I saw some unbelievable pizzas and small plates around.For dessert we got a caramelized banana with their vanilla gelato. It was absolutely divine and was a HUGE portion for 3 people. The limoncello was also very tasty and according to the said Italian friend, it was \"just like how my dad made it.\" For the restaurant to be located where it is, I was expecting to pay a lot more for the food, but it was surprisingly fair and the foods were of high quality.

We wandered to the back of the bar area and found one lone empty table and grabbed it. We immediately were greeted by our sweetheart server and filled out our antipasto card for starters. We went with some Pecorrino and Gorgonzola cheeses and some Soppresatta and Duck Proscuitto. We also ordered the LITER wine, as surely a bottle would not suffice! The space is so warm and welcoming. Even though it was very busy, it wasn't too loud and the service was exceptional. Our starter plate came with about 6-8 little dips and sauces and home made Giardinaire which rocked. We were having such fun experimenting with trying to make 'the perfect bite' with all the little ingredients.We ordered a couple of veal sliders to share which were AMAZING and tasted like someone's grandma's secret recipe. And then of course we had to get a pizza and chose the sausage which came with some crazy good roasted tomatoes and lots of fennel.

But this place changed my mind. PLUS, they have CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP wine!!! Went here with a friend and we each got a 1/4 carafe of wine for $6. I thought I was reading the menu wrong, but no. I received a cute little carafe with just enough wine to warm me up on the inside and make me want to have deep, philosophical conversations:) And this place isn't just about cheap wine - the food was outstanding. We ordered the clams in wine sauce - super garlicky and salty and we got extra bread to sop up all the delicious sauce. Then we got the tortellini in Alfredo sauce with prosciutto, peas, and ham - WOWSA! I would never order this on my own because I don't even like Alfredo sauce, but my friend convinced me to try it and I may now be a convert. The sauce was the best I've ever had - like the most decadent Parmesan just melting in your mouth. I honestly could go back every other day and eat that stuff. And then the pizza was great - nice thin crust with quality ingredients. So for about $25 bucks a piece, we stuffed our faces with good food, drank tasty, cheap wine, and had great wine-fueled girl talk. One thing to watch out for - don't try and eat clams if tipsy.

This being said, coming to the \"big city\"...I grew to love/adore/devour tapas. How could I have been missing this 23 years of my life?Quartino reminds me of an Italian version of Caf\u00e9 Iberico, a tapas place that I adore and used to haunt when I worked downtown. This Italian counterpart has all the makings of its (unlikely) twin...small, tables close together, LOUD, dishes coming out when they're ready, aiming for family style...much of this already pointed out by other Yelpers. I'm not really a fan of traditional style, Olive Garden looking restaurants, so I was excited to try this place...seemed like it was my kind of Italian joint.However, for my first trip here, I came with a party of 18 for a birthday. Here's my experience racked up.The birthday girl ordered a preset menu, which was a great idea. The only downfall was the fact I couldn't really determine how much I'd be spending. At my end of the table, we did order a liter of wine for about $16. The house red was good.Here's a run down of our small plates:--Margarita Style Pizza - hot, hot, hot...burned the roof of my mouth. The sauce was kind of tart and I wanted more cheese.--Sausage Pizza - again, hot hot hot...burned the roof of my mouth...pretty much like the Margarita with random sausage slices thrown on top. --Calarmari - Pretty good. Could have been crispier though.--Tomato/Buffalo Mozzarella salad--DELICOUS...ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS...but I am huge fan of mozarrella--Parmesan served in a little frying pan--sadly, I didn't taste this.--Scallops with capers & spinach--pretty good but the scallops were a little dry.--Mushroom risotto--looked absolutely revolting but was surprisingly good. --Pasta with what looked like ricotta cheese--pretty tasty.That's all I can really remember eating. Only the salad stood out.Highlights:--There was an embarrassing ordeal with the bill, and the servers were very accommodating and polite. Though I'm sure they snickered at us behind our backs (as I would have), with a party of 19, there's always bound to be confusion over paying the bill. It's a law of nature, frustrating but it always happens. All I can say is, I paid my fair share!--With our coupons, I ended up spending $30. Was it worth it? Considering the fact I chipped in for a bday, had wine, and the gratuity was included, I was pretty pleased. Pleased enough to come back here again on my own with a much smaller group to really try to enjoy my next Quartino experience. --MAJOR HIGHLIGHT - I don't know if it's only a Monday thing but there have half priced wines to go! I picked up a bottle of house red and white ($5 each) and a white called Water Color ($10). I got them to go and they charged gratuity...so $25 for 3 bottles. Not bad!

Always make sure to have a reservation ahead of time, the place always is full but the service was fast with getting our food to the table and you don't feel rushed. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, they had good music playing and made everyone feel welcomed. The service was great, the waiters are very friendly and nice they know the menu very well and they gave good recommendations to me and my family, since we weren't familiar with the menu. The food that my waiter recommended me was incredible and I would go back to get it again or try something new.For appetizers my family and I shared a prosciutto pizza that was home made pizza and for the \u00a0entrees I order a mushroom risotto. My new favorite food is now risotto with mushroom because the flavors were just so rich and blended together with the risotto. The portions were reasonable so they were not small and they fill you up. For \u00a0dessert one night we order the tiramisu, I didn't really like it as much as \u00a0my mother did, she said that it was so delicious and had the perfect moisture and texture. \u00a0We also went the night of my birthday and we ordered the Torta al Cioccolato, I don't have words to describe how delicious it was, I truly recommend it for everyone.

My friend told him that she would have preferred something else (I can't remember what, exactly) but was not complaining. The manager insisted we get what we ordered exactly how we wanted or to order something completely different. We insisted that everything was fine. \u00a0A while later our server tells us that our meals are on the house and offered us a free dessert to go with it! WOW! It was unnecessary but I was completely satisfied and happy. We ordered the dark chocolate fondue with strawberries and it was so good.

The space is very warm and inviting, and our group of five was seated in the mist of out-of-town families, older couples, and twenty-somethings that had probably just gotten off work. Our waiter was friendly enough, though hard to get a hold of during the peak time. Our party was very excited to see a valet in the bathroom.We were all poor college students, so instead of ordering in the manner suggested (1.5 plates person), we each ordered one dish and then got an order of calamari as an appetizer. This worked fine, as none of us needed a ton of food anyways, but I understand how the average person would not be satisfied with one plate. The calamari's breading was light, crispy, and well seasoned-- a very good start. For the main dish I ordered the linguine with clams, and the rest of the table tried the gnocchi, the lasagna al Forno, and the garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello. The lasagna took a while to come out, though that's pretty typical for such a dish, and everything else was speedy. I ordered the linguine with the white sauce, and it was light and buttery in such a way that I can't imagine the red sauce working nearly as well. It was simple and fresh, the clams were especially good, but nothing amazing. Opinions about the gnocchi were split, one person liked it but another said it was bland, the lasagna was tasty but unmemorable, and the table agreed the garganelli was very good. We all came away from the meal pleased, though not wowed. Don't get me wrong, I had a good experience. For a restaurant in this location, the food was affordable and un-gimmicky.

I also ended up having a slice or 2 of the pizza and it had a very gummy crust and the basil was cooked in rather than on top and there didn't seem to be any fresh sliced tomato which is the basic of a Mahgarita pizza.

I liked that we could order a bunch of plates and just pass around. This way, we all got to try a little of everything and I left full, but not stuffed. From the pizza to the risotto, everything was very good and well prepared. The sangria was also very tasty, and I liked the fact that wine and sangria came in a variety of sizes.

Most tapas places I've been to average $5 - $7 per plate. We go tthe veal sliders - covered in bland, tastless tomato sauce so you couldn't taste the veal at all. The sliders were accompanied by a picked veggie salad, which actually had some flavor, but was just okay. We got the eggplant parmesan, which was covered in cheese and the tasteless tomato sauce, the clams, which was the best thing all evening, th beet salad, which had a weird dressing on it, making the dish a bit slimy. We got a pasta dish with apples and nuts and gorgonzola, and again, it lacked flavor. I'm not really sure how gorgonzola can lack pizazz, but they managed it. I got a savignon blanc wine, which was good. I liked that you could get different size wine carafes - quarter, half and full. Bread they served was just okay - didn't taste like fresh baked bread, which they advertised it to be. Meal was $56 before tip. I would spend my money elsewhere. Service was a 2 out of 5.

We made reservations well in advance for our culinary tour across America, and my boyfriend is a chef so we are all about tapas style cuisine. The hostess had an issue finding our reservation and told us to wait 20 minutes in the bar. The cocktail waitress was downright rude when we asked to pay for our drinks right away, as the hostess called our name five minutes later. We already had cash and a tip out and nicely asked the cocktail waitress to transfer our bar tab to our table in the dining room. She literally refused and rudely \"asked\" \"dont you guys mind paying here?\" I was immediately turned off based on our first impression. Being in the restaurant industry we know how to tip and we know rudeness when we see it, doing exactly the opposite of a specific guest request is a big no-no where we come from in Las Vegas and NYC but anyways... Thank goodness our server was great, he is truly the only reason we are giving three stars instead of two. He was excellent, attentive, knowledgable and apologetic for the few little snafus from the kitchen. (He didn't even know about the situation at the bar.) Anyways, the ambiance was cool, I liked the candelabras with real candles on the bigger tables and the decor. I know this is a personal thing, but the tiny little \"shot glass\" looking things they serve with the wine carafes are one of my pet peeves. I want my pinot noir to aerate properly, one glass at a time, in a nice big red wine glass. Their glasses made me, a pretty avid wine drinker, want to drink less. And one glass was skunked, but our server got me another one and it was better so no worries, that happens sometimes. The food was underwhelming, almost as if it had been awesome at one point and then, well, I don't know, but the food had so much potential to be great! The cheese fondue was ok, the cured meats were good, The bone marrow was horribly over done and the bread crumbs on top were overwhelming.

Tried the tiramisu (another half order suggestion from server which was perfect size). The dessert was underwhelming as the lady fingers were missing a soaking with espresso (or coffee) and rum, and the topping was dusted exclusively with and too much cocoa power (should have chocolate shavings).

This was our first time dining there and we had an experience I've never had before and may never have again. The atmosphere is noisy and friendly (Sat night)--a big place but they take good care of customers and we didn't have to wait at all to be seated with a 7 PM reservation. The food is very good. It's not fine dining; it's small plates, Italian, and you can get away with a really good individual pizza for $10-12 or you can spend more and try various plates. Wine was good, nice beer selection, and you can order all at once or try appetizers, salads, olives, etc and then pick out some entree plates. We had pizzas, duck, potato pancakes, salads, seafood and it was all good. The unbelievable part, however, was the service. The waitress stopped by often enough to see that we were ok but was never hovering. Everything arrived fine except for some scallops. We were not unhappy or annoyed but reminded her and she apologized profusely, which was more than enough especially since the restaurant was very busy and we were enjoying ourselves and had plenty to eat. The scallops came and they were comped. And then the potato pancake came and we were told that was comped too. And then a plate with three salads arrived that we hadn't ordered, compliments of the restaurant. THEN the manager stopped by and apologized and asked us if he could buy us more wine; we declined due to rapidly filling bellies. He told us dessert would be provided--also comped--and in a bit we watched in amazement (as did all the diners around us) as \u00a01) a bananas/ice cream concoction, 2) a huge chunk of tiramisu, 3) an individual chocolate cake with ice cream, and 4) six beignets with dipping sauces began arriving at our table. We were in shock (and shared our good fortune with nearby diners). All of this was comped, because our scallops plate got lost in the shuffle. I cannot say enough about this place and we will definitely plan to go back, but folks looking for a good unpretentious place to eat and folks visiting should know that this is a great value and they WILL take care of you. It's not like we were regular customers or celebrities. They really wanted us to be happy. So go eat there!

Angus Beef carpaccio was not only pink (\"is that veal?\" asked my guest) but draped off the edges of the plate. Gross. Pizza were obviously rushed out of the kitchen, sloppy and visually unappealing (one was literally covered with basil leaves such that you couldn't see the pizza). Polenta sticks were yummy. Ravioli stuffed with veal was just a mess. I'll leave it at that. Extremely unappetizing. Good news is that the waiter comped our Bloodies, but the food preparation and presentation was unbelievably poor - especially in the middle of a city that knows good food.
