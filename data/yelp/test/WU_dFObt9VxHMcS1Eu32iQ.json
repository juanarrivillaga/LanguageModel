I have a weird stigma attached to breweries that serve food at an equal level as the beer. I was shocked when the first beer I tried was delicious...and then the second. Don't get me wrong, they weren't all hits, but overall the beers and the food are mighty good at Piece.I've heard horror stories of the wait at Piece. It's Wicker Park, after all, and my friends and I went on a Saturday night. When we checked in, they told us the wait for 5 was 40 minutes. Not as bad as I expected at all. Just enough time to grab a beer and hang out at the bar actually. Imagine my surprise when after just 20 minutes they called us to sit down! We were sat at a booth in the somewhat secluded upper section which was nice but it's dark as heck up there. Completely fine for evenings but during the day, there needs to be a bit more lighting up there. I took my food pix in shame as the flash went off and I hid under the table.Piece's pizza is quite good. I'm not a tomato kind of girl and from what my friends were saying, the white pizzas are where it's at. Thin only! No deep dish biznits up in here. My friends and I got two white pizzas - one with mushrooms, banana peppers and italian sausage - the second with chicken & meatballs. I picked out the meatlovers one, of course. I wanted bacon on it, too, but my friends told me to relax on all the meat. The pizzas came out steaming hot and I enjoyed them both greatly. The crust was flaky and buttery and all the toppings were fresh & tasty. The garlic in the white pizza definitely came through. The tables are not very big and they bring the pizzas out on huge trays so there is no room for anything else on the table. You have to kind of tip toe your booty up so you can talk to your table mates, otherwise your face is covered by the massive pizza trays. I basically begged my friends to finish our meal with the chocolate pizza. Yea, we were all full but chocolate pizza?!?!?! Come on! It was so indulgent and we couldn't kill much of it but I liked it. I don't think it's something I'd ever get again just because of the sheer size of it, but it was S'mores-tacular! Beerwise - the Dark & Curvy is where it's at. You can get small 3 ozs. sizes of the beer for just $1 each! I had a full glass of the dark & curvy then the tiny sizes of every other beer on the menu (5 as the single & ready to mingle beer was out). Roland the Headless Assistant was my second favorite but the rest were a solid 3.5 bottle caps.Piece is way loud. My friends and I were sitting at a somewhat secluded booth and I think we said WHAT!? more than anything else Saturday night. Next time I go, I'm going to try to hit up an off time to avoid the bad acoustics.My one regret: Not getting the mashed potato & bacon pizza! All the more reason to go back! \u00a0Be warned though, prices can add up. Every ingredient you add to your pie will run you $1.75-$2 additional.", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Chicagoland, IL"}, {"Author": "Jessica P.", "ReviewID": "OEvIHnkoaNmoE1Bt-HqW5g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Roland te headless assistant brewer - a traditional oatmeal stout...i like it but there is a slight after taste..Pizza toppings...if u get only meat with white sauce..the pizza might be slightly dry...choose your toppings wisely..:)Chocolate pizza-delicious...looks and tastes like a s'more pizza.

Because I love their pizza a LOT.They call it New Haven-style, which maybe it is, but I've never been to New Haven, nor found another New Haven-style pizza place to compare it to. So all I know for sure is that it's awesome and pretty unique, especially for Chicago. The thin crust is the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy, the sauces are delicious, and the toppings are plentiful and flavorful. (My go-to combo: sausage, onion, goat cheese on a white pizza. I call it The Makeout Special.) Seriously one of the top 5 pizzas in Chicago, especially if you can't or won't commit to deep dish on a given night.So if I love the pizza so much, why only three stars? I'm glad you asked; it's because literally everything else about this place is a pain in the ass. The Six Corners area of Wicker Park can be a nightmare to navigate. The restaurant itself is so crowded that there's always a wait if you are eating anywhere close to a normal mealtime (plus, everyone has a \"passed over at Piece\" horror story or two), and so loud that conversation is practically impossible. The non-pizza offerings are just average (although, to be fair, they might suffer from the fact that they are simply in the way of the pizza). Service tends to range from indifferent to downright bad (again, owing to the crowds). They do offer carry-out and delivery options which you would think would mitigate these problems, but the pizza doesn't travel as well as a Chicago-style pie (which I actually think benefits from the extra time to set). I guess you could order carry-out and then eat it in your double-parked car outside the restaurant, but that could get weird and/or messy.Ultimately, the wonderful pizza makes up for the many other shortcomings. I like taking friends from out of town here because it not only shuts them up about pizza in Chicago being more like lasagna or whatever, but because the long wait and the noisy interior make it feel like an EVENT more than a meal. Of course, that's also a fair representation of why I only rarely come here myself.", "Date": "2014-07-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Melissa M.", "ReviewID": "djossPHoZeJTe0vPyXpMlw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LOVE Piece!

Seriously. The pizza is great (and an amazing thin crust alternative to Chicago's awesome but heavy deep dish). The small was almost too much for me and another person. A medium could easily feed 3-4 people and is only $15. The beer is great and its a local brew! I had the \"Golden Arm,\" which was the perfect light lager for me. We were told by a friend that the wait here could easily reach an hour and a half (just to be seated), but we were willing to risk it. We were told 20 minutes, waited 30, and had food in our mouths under an hour after walking through the door.

My coworker spent a good month or two bragging about Piece and shoving the ever-amazing clam & bacon pizza in my face. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I decided to plan a get-together with several friends as a part of my birthday in April. I came on a Thursday night and read online that a reservation should be made for parties of 10 or more. I filled out their group reservation request and received a reply within 2 hours notifying me that there would be a $25 non-refundable reservation fee...which I thought was absolutely ridiculous.So I decided to wing it and just have my group there and wait for a table. Two of my friends got there before me and tried to get us a table--but were told that at least half of the party had to be there before being seated.

They've nailed it to the tee the pizza has a strong chewy but crispy dough texture, the sauce has a perfect balance of the zesty, tangy, and sweet and they use high-quality ingredients all the way. They use high temperature ovens and they cook the pizza dough at the bottom with cornmeal which gives it a perfect crunchiness and flavor that pizza deserves.I usually order their pizza with extra cheese because normally it does come with a good amount of sauce and I've had many different topping style pizzas. And of course I had to have their clam and bacon pizza which is a staple in the New Haven Connecticut area, from a place called Pepe's pizza which has won number 1 Pizzeria the country yr in and yr out. It's almost as good as Pepe's and it is very delicious, plus I do highly recommend the mashed potato pizza, another thing famous in the New Haven area at a place called Bar.I am so happy that this place exists my only regret is that there's not more places like Piece in the Chicago area and that where I live goes outside of their delivery area but they do know me by first name as it is tradition to have a pizza at least once a week.

This made the decision to go down the street three feet, to Piece's takeout hall, that much easier.We ordered a large mashed potatoes and bacon, and a medium spinach and goat cheese. Half an hour later we walked out the door with our pies. The pies are BIG. The three of us could've eaten a large with no leftovers but full tummies. The flavors, again were out of the box, but could've used some seasoning. The mashed potatoes were under seasoned, the bacon was just fine and the spinach was undetectable. The crust tasted lackluster and without the toppings tasted burnt. Not charred, not baked in the brick oven taste, but burnt. The pies were edible, and I'll gladly fill my belly with the leftovers, however I don't think I would ever pay $50 for these two pizzas again.

I was happy enough with my Moose Knuckle (barley wine), which was hoppy for a barley wine and an interesting drink to try.Now, onto the pizza. I know everyone has different opinions on pizza; I'd never had New Haven Style before and after my experience at Piece I don't think I can call myself a fan. If you happen to enjoy it, my apologies. But here's my two cents: New Haven style is thin crust cooked on a cookie sheet. Since cookie sheets don't retain as much heat as a stone, I can only imagine that the pizzas must be cooked longer, which makes the crust very hard. If you like harder crusts Piece would probably be great for you; these crusts were too hard for me. They weren't merely crunchy on the outside, they were hard all the way through. The toppings of my pizza slid off with every effortful bite I had to take and this was an overall messy, unpleasant, and probably unattractive experience.As many others have mentioned the atmosphere is noisy; this is probably a better place to chill with a large group. The staff seem to be used to this and they accommodated our group of about 8 easily.My mediocre beers left a piece of me slightly disappointed, and my piece of pizza was uninspiring.

But maybe it's not exactly what you would think I'm a fan of. I mean, sure, the pizza was good & fine and whatnot. But I'm not going to uproot my family and move there because of it. I think there were 2 other things that struck me here. First, the beer. The selection was solid, and the stuff I've gotten over the years (yes, several times over the years) has always been really, really good. It's to the point that I've strongly considered bringing some of it back home with me. I never did that, but I thought about it. Perhaps I was not 100% sober when thinking these thoughts. Still...I should also mention that I did like the food. My coworkers at the time always wanted to go here on 1 of the nights we went out, so we ended up here often. I was never disappointed to go. It's actually nice to go to a place in Chicago that does not tout themselves as a steakhouse in some way, shape, or form.Second, the chocolate pizza and how accommodating they were when I went there with my daughter. Like many places in Chicago, there is a very big yuppie/urbanite feel to this place. I find that Chicago often resembles a very big version of Hoboken in some ways. As you can imagine, this is not necessarily a great setting for a 6 year old. Having said that, I feel the place was very welcoming of her when we went there. And because of that, and her love of the chocolate pizza, I am appreciative of. There are a lot of places to eat in Chicago and I'm not going to say that you should absolutely go here.

The sound on the TV was turned off, and we had to ask the bar staff to turn on the closed captioning. Unfortunately, when the TV sound was turned on, it was still inaudible. The dining room is SO LOUD AND CROWDED you can hardly hear yourself think. Forget about hearing televised voices!When a table was available, we didn't dare move, since we didn't know where we would be relative to a television. At least at the bar there was a TV straight ahead, and I could at least read the closed captioning. (I would've preferred a booth or a lower chair, however.)The party basically consisted of predictions (I was never given a form or whatever means they had of gathering the info, so wasn't even afforded the chance to participate, even though we told the host that we were there for the Oscars party) and a few trivia questions. \u00a0I did end up winning a DVD (Pulp Fiction) for the final trivia question, which was allegedly \"tricky,\" but which any semi-hardcore Oscars fan would have known right away. (Q: Who has hosted the Oscars the most times? A: Bob Hope.)We ate pizza and drank beer. It was good, but it was hard for me to enjoy it, as I devoted most of my attention to reading the closed captioning. Needless to say, we won't be back for the Oscars or indeed anytime during dinner hours. It was honestly too loud and busy to really be enjoyable in any capacity, even if I hadn't been annoyed about the sorry excuse for an Oscars party.", "Date": "2014-03-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ryan G.", "ReviewID": "TbQcsFq889kauEbcjZBs3Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The crust of the medium red pizza I had was very good, ate most of it while dining in.

I came early, put my name in at 6PM because it was busy and we had a pretty big party (6 people). I was told that once it would be probably 1-1.5 hours. The waiting begins. We play games, we play on our phones, we walk across the street and get a drink. About 1.5 hours in, we go back to ask if we're near. We're told it should be about another 45 minutes. At this point, the people at the hostess stand actually point out \"They've been waiting for almost two hours\" and pointing to my name which is at the top of the list their looking at to which the response is, \"Well, it's still going to be 45 minutes\". Okay.45 minutes passes and it's now about 815PM and people are getting seated (lots of little tables) and we begin to notice that there are some bigger tables that are staying open for 10+ minutes right next to us and we begin to wonder what would happen if we just commandeered one (it was seated like 10 minutes later). We didn't get seated until almost 845PM. *sigh*Was the pizza good? Yeah. White pizza with chicken, roasted red peppers and mushrooms. But was it work waiting almost 3 hours? I don't know. I could probably go to Pequods and still have delicious pizza... I just wish that they would have some sort of paging system so you don't have to physically be present FOREVER to wait.

Came in on a Tuesday night with the boyfriend, Alex H. and Claire K. We had no trouble getting a table for four, although it was definitely crowded for a weekday night. Piece brews their own beer which is pretty awesome. The four of us tried a variety of their offerings and liked them all, I especially liked the Golden Arm.For dinner, we started with the Piece Green Salad with chicken. It was really tasty and came in a large portion, I definitely recommend this if you choose to get a starter. For dinner, the four of us split a large pizza. We went a little wild on the toppings...one side contained chicken, bacon, jalapeno, and artichoke. The other side had Italian sausage, mushrooms, spinach, and onion. They were both great and a large was more than enough to feed us, it basically took up the entire table. Adding all of those toppings certainly packed a punch to those thin slices. One of the best parts about eating Piece in the restaurant is that the long slices don't get as soggy.Two reasons for taking off a star, the first being that their pizza is incredibly salty. Not sure if it's the cheese they use or what, but I was inordinately thirsty the rest of that evening and the next morning. Second is that the booths are pretty uncomfortable. None of us were comfortable on the hard wood seats with not much space. Besides that, it's a great pizza place and certainly some of the best thin crust I've had in Chicago.

But regardless whether I like deep dish pizza, I shouldn't betray my city and love another city's signature pizza... right? Well New Haven style pizza is pretty much amazing. So going against everything Chi-caaa-go in me, I have to say that Piece is my favorite pizza place ever. The pizzas are pretty much order completely custom to your selection of size, sauces (three to choose from; red, white, and New Haven style), cheeses, and toppings. I'm not a fan of white sauce pizzas, so I have yet to try that version, but the red and the New Haven style sauces are ridiculously good. The pizza comes out in a huge tray with the crispiest, most balanced pizzas I have had in Chicago. While the combination of toppings is up to you, I have yet to have a topping that I didn't think was fresh and delicious (especially the sausage). We went on the first day that they offered Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza (as a collaboration promotion they are doing for February). Being a fan of Honeybutter Fried Chicken and Piece, I naturally was very hyped to try it. While the pizza and the chicken were really high quality offerings, I think they're much better separate. It was a little bit of a let down, but still a good pizza. I think it's more for really hardcore fans of both these fine establishments, but if you're not, it's not the end of the world if you skip it. Overall, Piece is awesome. It provides a high quality pizza at a very, very reasonable price (usually get a large to split for $20-$25). The place is usually packed, and the wait is usually well worth it.

After reading a few other reviews I see that I am not alone in my extremely negative experience at this restaurant. Being someone who has worked in the service industry before, I am still shocked after encountering a staff that was so extremely rude, incredibly arrogant, and made you (the customer) feel as if you were lucky to even walk through the door. I understand there are rules and protocols staff need to follow when seating people, especially during busy times in a restaurant. However, this staff seemed to make up rules as they went, not take blame when they made a mistake and skiped over parties who had been waiting for hours longer than others who were seated first, and, instead, blame the customers and lie about the situation at hand.When speaking with the Manger regarding our situation, he admitted that some parties were seated before our's because individuals in those parties \"knew the owners\" which I guess I can at least appreciate the honestly. However, what was really hard to accept was when he claimed that multiple parties of 6-8 people had \"made reservations\" and thus were seated before us (after we had waited for over 2 hours at this point) although I had called the restaurant earlier in the day to make a reservation and was told they only took reservations for parties larger than 20 people from Friday to Sunday and for parties larger than 10 people during the week, meaning the Manager lied to us...to our face.Never once did any of the staff offer any type of apologize for the long wait or mix-up that had happened in their seating of customers, but instead stated (and I quote) \"Maybe you should go write a bad review of us on Yelp.\" So, I took their advice and here I am, writing a bad review on Yelp, just as they requested.Obviously this review is not about the food or beer, but about the incredibly poor and unprofessional service they provided, or did not provide.

I still am not quite sure it does.Let me explain: What I had at Piece was a very tasty, very flavorful, very mouthwatering... warm salad. Maybe cool soup. But it was not really pizza. As I said, the tastes were very terrific--I tried the Plain-style (New Haven) pie, but added spinach, feta, and tomatoes. I also started with the goat cheese appetizer (freaking delicious; wonderful marinara and, as advertised, a \"generous\" portion of cheese). The pie, however, was soupy; the crush was so thin and flat in the middle that it could not hold the toppings (or the sauce) on top. Everything just fell off ass the dough folded downward on itself. I had to fold the end of each slice back up on top of the wider portion to hold each slice in my hand.Do not get me wrong--I really enjoyed how everything tasted. And the edges of the crush were crunchy and pleasant. But the middle third or more of the pie was just tomatoes and other toppings on very soggy, thin dough. Not what I'd call a pizza.As another comment, I did not have opportunity to try the brewed beers. Those may very well be just as mouth-worthy as the food. But if I'm getting pizza, I don't want to have to use a fork (or spoon) to transfer the food from plate to pie-hole. Perhaps the pizza would hold up better with no toppings (only sauce, oregano, and Parmesan--true New Haven style [I'm told]). But it should be able to hold the weight of some extra tomatoes. The water weight should not be collapsing the dough; it is the medium, after all!To sum up: Tastes = wonderful. Place = enjoyable. Beers = ? (I have a good feeling).

Speaking of neighborhood, it's a great launch spot for later wicker buck carousing. Speaking of atmosphere, it's interior design works well when packed but doesn't feel cavernous when not as busy. Both karaoke nights and football Saturday/Sundays are particularly busy but the crowd brings a lot of fun energy. Not too hipster not too yuppy but eclectic enough to suit either or neither. Probably wouldn't do date night here, but its a perfect place to take family and friends from out of town, or go with single friends to mingle and jingle.

I was on my third by the time my party arrived and I was only there for about 45 minutes soooo that was my last one.

I would recommend to the ladies....We ordered two larges. One red pizza w/Sausage, Garlic, Mushroom, and Basil. The sausage was good, I wished there was more basil though. We ordered clam and bacon on our white pizza. This was my favorite! The clam and bacon combo was amazing. They give you lemon wedges as well and at first i was skeptical but squeeze some of that on and you're in heaven....Thank me later. I was a little disappointed in the edge crust. I ALWAYS eat the crust but the crust was just kinda hard and bland...But I did eat some leftovers today and the crust was actually softer when eaten cold.

As such, consider this to be mainly focused on the pizza.It was pretty delicious. The pizza style for those in the know is New Haven. The base pizza price is normal however topping prices are not tiered, but topping amount is. Basically you'll pay for their topping but you won't see it on your small or medium pizza. Also, you wouldn't want to have the amount of topping that goes on a large, on a small. It messes with the harmony and balance you'd expect from a restaurant. This is why most places have tiered topping amounts and prices.There was another slight issue I had. There were quite a few areas of uncovered pizza. There are usually two reasons this happens, they may not have aerated the pizza dough before putting it in the oven (the bubble you may see) and or they just forgot to cover it.

I'm not a huge IPA fan, but my favorite beers were the IPA's by Piece. Regarding food, the Red pizza (classic) is superior to the White pizza (no tomato sauce but more garlic and seasoning). The red sauce has a sweet start but a nice and hearty finish. The premium toppings are all quite tempting. A couple on that list included meatballs, mashed potatoes, and artichoke hearts. There are other items on the menu like salads and sandwiches, but you'd be a fool to pass up pizza in Chicago. Prices on the menu are quite reasonable as the quality of food and drink is definitely high. Piece is a modest sized place and can definitely get very busy.

From the pizzas I've had in Chicago, this is possibly the best, and the beer selection is quite good and quite varied. A few details:Pizza - crust is unbelievably good, with the perfect amount of char and crispiness. Very long, thin slices. I personally prefer the red sauce pizza to the white pizza, but both are great. The toppings selection is fairly typical (excluding mashed potatoes, clams) but every ingredient is high quality and done right.Beer - house-made, many different styles (kolsch, stout, IPA, wheat, others). All are fairly good, and I find the kolsch to be a particular standout.Service - good. The place gets very busy at peak times, so expect a wait (one hour plus) if that's when you decide to go. It's a huge place, but it's also hugely popular, so the wait really can't be helped.Other - live band karaoke on Saturday nights. Some performers seem fairly legit. Pretty fun.Delivery Radius (an aside) - I am located about three blocks outside of their delivery zone, so they refuse to deliver to my place. I feel like Elaine from that episode of Seinfeld where she pretends to be a janitor in another building to get delivery.Overall - the pizza is flawless, and the beer is also very good, which is especially impressive given that they make it themselves. 5 stars.", "Date": "2013-09-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Meredith K.", "ReviewID": "AoDVur3YgbXQodQlJKQpHg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Tried Piece for the first time on a week night after hearing great reviews on the thin crust pizza.

Piece has been on my list of places to go in the city for awhile, not only because of the consistent great reviews I've read, but because how can you go wrong with pizza and craft beer? It seems like a winning combination!From what I have seen on the weekends in Wicker Park, if you want to go to Piece I would reconsider unless you mind waiting for an extended period of time. I went on a Tuesday night and later on in the evening, so my friend and I were seated right away. Our server was your typical nerdy cute hipster and the perfect balance between friendly and aloof. He was attentive with our drinks which is always a staple for me.Speaking of drinks, my friend and I love craft beer, but who in Chicago doesn't these days? Piece claims to pride itself on its beer, so we each ordered a different one. Neither of us were impressed, in fact we were both disappointed in our choices. Maybe my expectations were too high, but when they've won several awards over the years from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup, one would assume that these beers would be out of this world. Since craft beer is so popular these days, a lot of restaurants are trying to brew their own beer but they forget that it's more than just having the product at your customer's disposal; you need to make sure its a quality product that they will keep coming back for.Besides the beer, Piece is renowned for their pizza. We checked on Foursquare for recommendations, but the idea of mashed potatoes on a pizza wasn't exactly what we were looking for. We decided to do something we knew we would like which was spinach and mushrooms with traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza. While we waited for the pizza, we decided to order guacamole and chips. It seems like an odd choice to have for a pizza pub, but with the limited amount of other appetizer choices it was the best option. We were both thrilled that we ordered the guacamole because it was actually better than the pizza. The pizza was nothing spectacular, but it wasn't the worst I have ever had. The sauce was decent, but it definitely needed more cheese. The small was the perfect amount for 2 people and it's served on a baking sheet so that adds a unique touch. I did enjoy my time at Piece, but if you're going for the pizza and beer you may want to reconsider your choice.

That's where my enjoyment, unfortunately, ended.I am a life long Chicagoan and I know what I like as far as pizza goes. Moreover, I am from the south side and was raised on solid, real (read: thin crust) Chicago pizza. So, I am picky about it. Seeing as this place predicates itself upon the reputation of it's pizza, I am rating it accordingly.The pizza is pathetic. To me, it tasted like a low class frozen pizza at Jewel. I was horrified and amazed that anyone from Chicago would consider this a good pizza. But then, I looked at the hipsters all around me and it was clear as to who thinks it's good. Definitely not my kind of people nor would I expect them to have the same tastes as I do. On first bite, I sat silently awaiting my girlfriend's reaction. She take a few bites, looks at me, and states, \"This is horrible. It tastes like Jack's frozen pizza at the grocery store.\" Yup, my initial take on this hunk of garbage was validated.I'm upping the review from one star to two for the beer.BTW - right after I saw my good friend who was hosting open poetry at Weeds. When I told him where I went he said, \"Man, I could have told you that place sucks!\". Since then, I've heard that from other friends as well.

Don't ask how my friends and I came up with that combo. It was a long, drawn out process, over weeks and weeks, with a lot of taste tasting involved. My only complaint is that because their crust is so thin, sometimes if you are ordering a pizza topped with a lot of veggies the center comes out soggy.

We did white pizza with sausage, tomatos, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms. The sausage was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. The roasted red peppers were tasty but could have had more \"roasted\" flavor and the tomatos were perfectly ripe. The white pizza added a delicious buttery/olive-oily flavor.

I pretty much demolished it, not being accustomed to such a delicate crust. I'm part of a brash Chicago style tradition where we take a machete to our pizzas and top them with the souls of our enemies. My barbarian pizza tendencies took a while to adapt to the nuances of thin crust. There was definitely a learning curve. Once I learned how to pick up a slice without it flopping around and spraying everyone with toppings, I learned how to appreciate good pizza. So it was Saturday night, and I felt obligated to queue myself up for karaoke. I did. Drank a lot of beers in the two hours leading up to my short gig.

I have told friends not to go here and expect deep dish. Piece is pretty up front about that since they come right out & say it. There's Chicago, New York & the style they make- New Haven style. The best way to understand this is that the crust is more flat than thin. The way the dough is made and how it's cooked are totally different methods of cooking (that's a story in itself; I believe they call it \"apizza\"). The texture is closest to Neapolitan style. The sauce is also a bit different and you choose from the following: red (tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza), plain a traditional New Haven pizza, a generous amount of red sauce topped with garlic, extra parmesan and olive oil (This pizza does not have mozzarella.) & white plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese. I kept my pizza somewhat simple- I went with red. Now things get expensive once you start adding other toppings. I added sausage & mushrooms ($2.00/each). Still, the taste was very good.

Unfortunately, nearly a half hour if not longer passed until we learned that the oven had been turned off. My first thoughts were \"you're kidding me right?\" Your pizza oven of a very popular place for a Sunday football watching evening is shut off as our server informed only after she took the time to figure out why she wasn't clearing tables fast enough. For our inconvience, they offered us a free app. We were alright with that and ordered it since it was a planned lazy Sunday dinner for us.We never connected with the app, so she offered us dessert for later. Instead, the pizza arrived right about the point where I was too hungry to eat. Despite the long, agonizing wait for the pizza and the Packers loss against the Vikings, our food satisfied and hit the much needed empty stomach food spot. I loved the crunchy crust and just right crispy pie. Our wanton hunger completely overshadowed that she got our order wrong. Only half way through did we realize that we had an italian sausage and bacon pizza on our hands. At this point, we just didn't care and ate with wild abandon. Their pizza is delicious. I don't know if it worth as long of wait that we suffered. It's definitely better than our weekly standard pizza fare. After consuming our pizza, we got dessert: a massive piece of chocolate cake and ice cream with cookies. The ice cream and cookies were alright; nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. Last night, we finished our leftovers. I had some of the chocolate cake. It's mounds and mounds of delicious chocolate.

Piece is in Wicker Park. \u00a0Wicker Park is a minimum 20 drive by highway to the loop, then there's a 10 minute drive to find your office, then there's a 10 minute ring a ling ding pizza is here, someone go down and get it, then there's a 5 minute signing of the receipts, then there's a \"pizzas here!\" lets wait for everyone... \u00a0So minimally 20 minutes later you're consuming the pizza... \u00a0So in other words, by the time you're putting the pizza into your mouth in your Loop high-rise office, chances are the pizza has been out of the oven for an hour and 15 minutes. \u00a0 \u00a0It isn't magic, it's pizza delivery.. So even though it's an option, it might not be an option that best represents what Piece can serve.We ordered a medium this past weekend. \u00a0Red pizza. \u00a0Even though New Haven pizza is their style, they do a really amazing red pizza, and it's the one I'd recommend most (and actually, it's the one they recommend if you ask them for a recommendation). \u00a0It was $19 for a medium half pepperoni, half sausage (it's thin crust).Their medium pizza seems A) a lot more expensive than I remember it and B) maybe a little larger than I remember it.When you're ordering piece pizza, try not to do the \"half this\" \"half that\" thing... \u00a0Many places would only charge you for one topping if you get half pepperoni and half sausage or something, Piece charges you twice. \u00a0Also, their toppings menu is split into regular toppings and \"premium\" toppings. \u00a0For some reason, they've recently moved pepperoni and Italian sausage into the \"premium\" topping category, so they're $2/each. \u00a0I'm guessing they did this for no other reason than they're the most popular toppings... I doubt pepperoni prices have skyrocketed or anything. \u00a0Also, if you do 1/2 and 1/2, I think they charge you full price for both. \u00a0...So their pricing can really be a sham sometimes...

So when someone first told me to try out Piece I was skeptical to say the least. I could not have been more happy at being introduced to this place.

Awesome combination of salty & sweet (and healthy too, cuz of the spinach!). Of course Piece is a microbrew, so I have to mention the beers.

Everyone raves about Piece, but I'm a little overwhelmed by the giant rectangle of relatively cheeseless, thin-crusted, wet pizza. Its heavy on the sauce and brick oven flavor, moderate on the toppings, and skimpy on the cheese. Its not a bad pizza, its just not on my favorite list. We ordered two medium red pizzas; one with chicken and broccoli, and one with mushrooms, tomatoes, and green peppers. I have been here before about a year ago and had pizzas with some of the meat toppings and mashed potatoes. Similarly, I had stared at my friends confused at their raving about the starchy sloppy masterpiece that they had created.I would appreciate the \"build-your-own pizza\" menu if Piece added a few more options and didn't charge so much for a rather skimpy portion of each topping. However, I imagine that any more than two toppings would cause the pizza to fall apart like the generic paper towel in the Bounty commercial. Popular toppings missing are pineapple, canadian bacon, green olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. Since I'm a fan of pizzas called \"the works\" or \"veggie lover's,\" paying for each vegetable topping get a little pricey. Still, its a relatively cheap group outing.The atmosphere is typically hipster and the space is rather dark and cavernous. The wait can get pretty long, but they are more than accommodating with reservations. There is an echo from the barn-like ceiling, so just get used to nodding your head rather than hearing every word that the rest of your party is saying.

Plain, Red and White bullshit really confused us. Anyways, we ordered the large Margherita pie with garlic and it looked repulsive.

Headed down to Wicker Park on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock for a little night out with the lady friend. Pretty busy as expected but only a 20 minute wait. We hadn't eaten since lunch that day so we were both very hungry and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We originally wanted to order two smalls with a handful of toppings (garlic, pepperoni, mushrooms, and spinach on one and chicken and bacon on the other) which range between $1.75 and $2.00. Our friendly and knowledgeable waitress gave us the heads up to order one large half and half to save some dough. Very nice of her even though it ended up being a $29.00 pizza. She was very good with suggesting beers to our liking. The Camel Toe was ridiculously drinkable at 13.25% alcohol and very dangerous at that. That being said the service was a delight.The serving vessel for the pizza was a large sheet tray and anything smaller would not have been suitable. Holy shit the large is a lot of pizza. Needless to say we walked out with a half a large which turned out to be a full pizza box. Next time I think a small would have sufficed with all the toppings. The brewery sets Piece apart from the rest. The beer list is extensive and have something to suit anyone beer palate. The place was pretty packed but the noise level was certainly tolerable. You could get away talking about pretty much anything and the people next to you would have no clue. Overall I was impressed with the whole experience but then again its pizza. Nothing out of this world and the one qualm...no ranch!? Maybe they didn't want to taint the creation that sat high on our table.

Last weekend I reserved the \"pit\" for my b-day party, and they exceeded my already-high expectations. The manager helped me find a date when there were no other reservations, so my party could stay from dinner time until closing. The staff was attentive and friendly the entire time we were there. Reserving the \"pit\" is a great way to enjoy all that's awesome about Piece while avoiding the long waits and the crowds. You still feel like you're part of the scene, but your group gets its own space. It doesn't even cost extra-- all you need is a large enough group and a reservation made a few weeks ahead of time.Now for the requisite gushing about the pizza and beer: New Haven style pizza is definitely worth a try. It's its own thing-- they didn't try for authentic Italian pizza and miss the mark like some reviewers seem to think. The crust is the defining feature here: chewy yet fluffy and SO GOOD.

We went on a Saturday night for live band karaoke, which potential crooners beware, unlike your usual karaoke, there's no bouncing ball on the screen showing you the lyrics in time. You gotta know the song. This is great because it scares away some (but not all) of the people who suck and gives the people who know what they're doing a chance to shine. They'll give you a sheet with the lyrics on it, but if you're gonna go, bring some charisma because you've got a whole stage and band to work with. Sign up early because the set list gets really long. (For the record, I did Johnny B Goode by Chuck Berry and KILLED IT.)Like many other Wicker Park establishments, it features $2 PBR cans which helps keep the costs of a night in the city under control. They also brew their own beers. The Disfunction Ale was actually quite good. Sort of reminded me of Leinenkugel's discontinued Apple Spice, but with a fuller taste.The pizza is kind of a disappointment. I hungrily devoured three slices, but the composition isn't that great. It falls apart easily and makes everything messy. I can think of at least six places in Chicago that have better pizza.It gets crowded on Saturday but thins out a bit after midnight, remaining lively, so get there early.

I ordered one of the house beers once waiter came by, and from that point on the service was excellent (not sure if the high alcohol content in the beer had anything to do with that).I got a Caprese salad, BF got a Caesar, and we ordered the red pizza w/spinach, black olives and pepperoni. BF liked his salad very much, complete with anchovies (glad to see a place that doesn't dumb down their Caesar). I was looking forward to my Caprese, but sadly the tomatoes were unripe and mealy...not good at all, but the greens, roasted red pepper, dressing, and mozzarella were just fine.Before salads were delivered, waiter stopped by to inquire \"Would you like salt or pepper with your salads?\"...I thought that was kind of odd. We said \"No\", but then I'm thinking \"What if I want some pepper later, can I change my mind?\"....oh well, BF says I worry too much. Truth be told, my salad coulda used a little fresh cracked....but I had already made my decision, dammit. I loved the pizza, BF thought it was ok. I can totally see myself wanting to go here for a pie once a week if it were closer (or had easier parking). It's a totally different kind of pizza than anywhere else I can think of. There are so many different kinds of pizzas to love and this is one of them...it's a beautiful thing, really.I ordered a second beer and I told waiter to surprise me, and he was confidently up for the challenge.

I keep hoping it'll be better, but it never is. So, I'm done with this place.I called 3 weeks ago to make a reservation and they wouldn't take one. They said they were all booked up, no matter what size the party was. Really? I'm guaranteeing you service and you're turning me away?!?! I understand if the party has to be a certain size, but I could have made a reservation for 20 or multiple reservations for 4, if necessary--work with me, people! I'm trying to give you business!Whatever... so they told me that we had to get there about 1 hour early to wait for a table. We got there at 8pm, expecting to be seated at 9pm, and didn't get sat until 10pm! Then it took the server at least a good 15 minutes to engage with us.Once we were seated & had ordered, the food came out on time and was delicious & well-priced, hence the stars. Then came Karaoke...Karaoke started 30 minutes late. The Karaoke DJ was bogus and thought he was THE Karaoke God...so pretentious! Shouldn't the Karaoke DJ I'd encourage people in the audience to cheer on those who may not be the best singers but are putting themselves out there and trying their hardest? I mean, this isn't American Idol--this is a bar!He also let a group of kids sing 5 times in a row and let multiple people cut in line just because he knew them. I know this because we signed up at the beginning of the night and were expecting to go on within the first 8-10 songs. We probably sat through 15-20 songs until 12:30am and then the karaoke DJ said the band was going on break. When my friend asked him to please let us go next because we were leaving soon, he didn't listen to us at all and just said tough luck. So we left.

My youngest brother Joey was in town with his girlfriend, since they are home from college for a week break between summer classes and fall semester. Dave and I thought it would be a fun, casual place for the four of us to go and have good pizza and a good time.One note, Joey and his gf are both 20 years old, so we wanted to find a place that had a party atmosphere without being turned away at the door because they were underage. More on that later.We got to Piece at about 7:45 and were told it was going to be \"DEFINITELY A 45 MINUTE/HOUR WAIT\" by the host who couldn't even take the time to look up from his floorplan to smile at us or greet us politely. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because it was Saturday at peak time and I knew the place would be slammed. We had no problem waiting an hour since we could put our name in and wander around Wicker Park and kill time. Actually, we had kind of anticipated a wait and were planning to do that anyway. So off the four of us went, to goof around in the neighborhood, and we arrived back at Piece about a half hour later. When we went in to check on the table, and the doorman insisted on putting big, black X's on the both hands of my bro and his girlfriend...not a big deal but, okay, we get it, they can't drink in here. Dave went up to the host (who still had a bad attitude) and when he gave him our name, he looked at the list and declared...oh, we looked for you ten minutes ago and couldn't find you so now you're at the bottom of the list. This coming from the guy who had just said DEFINITELY AN HOUR thirty minutes ago. At that point I was a little annoyed because he said it would probably be a while before we could sit. But by this time we'd committed...so, fine.Well, good thing we didn't go anywhere because we were seated 5 minutes later. Dave and I ordered beers, which came promptly, but the waitress seemed like she was totally in the weeds, so much so that she didn't even give us her name. When the beers arrived, I tried mine and passed it over the table to give my brother a taste. A TASTE. For Chrissake's the kid is 20 years old, about to turn 21 in three months, and he's pledgemaster of his frat. I think he's tried alcohol before. He takes a taste, hands it back to me, and I kid you not, 10 seconds later the doorman comes by, slaps his hand over my brother's shoulder and goes NOT EVEN A SIP BUDDY. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.Uhhhh...okay. We wont think about it. But seriously, lighten up. We ordered two medium pizzas (one white pizza with Italian sausage and one red pizza with pepperoni). They were HUGE and came fast, but I personally thought both were really greasy. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but the pepperoni pizza almost had TOO MUCH pepperoni on it. I picked some off, because in some bites it was all I could taste. \u00a0The white pizza was good, but it was mostly cheese and a little light on the garlic and olive oil, which I think are the best parts of the white pizza. I think if their crust was a little bit thicker, it would have held up to all the toppings. But hey, I'm a thick crust kinda gal.When the waitress came and brought the bill, it was definitely reasonable (two medium pizzas and two beers for $50), but I would have happily ordered it for carry out or delivery to be spared the attitude of the staff. There are so many PHENOMENAL pizza places in Chicago (Pequod's, Art of Pizza) where both the pizza \u00a0and the service are great, so I think I deserve to be picky when it comes to Piece.I've heard Piece is a great place for big groups and parties, which I can totally see. I would give it another try on a not so busy night, if it was another person's pick.

The toppings are pretty right on no matter what we've ordered (though we do tend to stick to traditional sausage, pepperoni, meatball, mushrooms, onions, peppers combinations). And my experience with their mashed potato pizza wasn't exactly revelatory. But, overall, Piece provides a pretty decent pizza.Also worth a try are the goat cheese appetizer and the salad with pears, pecans and gorgonzola. Piece Beer, however, is OUTSTANDING! If I was judging their pizza and pizza alone, Piece would get 3, MAYBE 3.5 stars depending upon the visit. But their beer brings it to a whole different level (if I could rate Piece with a 4.5, I would). They have something to please every palate.

Even 24 hour later, I am not sure which I enjoyed more. We got the red pizza with onions, mushrooms and peppers. The pizza sort of falls apart so you might need to bust out the fork and knife, which is typically a sin. The marinara was seriously delish and it had a good pizza taste. Hearty as well with a lot of veggies! That made me happy since they charge $1.75/topping.The white pizza had meatballs and spinach. Fantastic! It was very garlic-y so be sure youre not the only one eating it. The make the meatballs themself so they are moist and flavorful.

They forgot about the chicken on the white pizza and put more onions. However, it was still delicious, we just had a very onion-y meal. Have had the ceaser salad, which is delicious, as well as the spinach and tomato dip. Both very good, but then I didn't have much room left for pizza. And the pizza is so good that I like to try to force myself to eat all of it, even though I can take home leftovers. (There are some in my fridge right now)This place is good for groups, although they only take reservations for 10 or more. And don't try to make a day-of reservation on the weekends, because they have gotten pretty snippy with me on the phone and have been like \"Uh, no.\" Also, sometimes the people that work at the front are weird and don't really pay attention to you.

It is a real burr in my crotch.Now, some breweries (Three Floyds, I'm scowling in your direction) refuse to refill growlers because they \"aren't Three Floyds clean\" and they want to protect quality. That's pretty much self serving BS, but whatever. That's another review...Piece takes a different tack on this stupid idea. They will only refill their own growlers (read: it has a Piece logo on it). The bar manager on duty explained that this was because only their growlers were \"assured to be at the proper level of quality.\"Proper level of quality? What quality? Advertising quality?Asked what the criteria for a Piece-certified growler was, she could only say, \"I only know we will only refill our own growlers.\"Well, being the dork that I am, I lined up a Piece growler next to several others that I have. They all look the same. No special doohickeys... the Piece one even weighed in at 10g lighter, so it's not heft that makes a \"quality\" growler...Sadly, these people need to learn to get along. Beer is fun, friendly and communal. Do you really think that refilling a Revolution growler is going to spoil your beer? Or lead to an explosion that takes out my eye and lands you a lawsuit? Or are you just self-conscious and greedy - like I'm going to serve Piece beer at a party and try to pass it off as some other brewery? Sheesh.What's next, people? An MP3 player that only plays songs loaded through Apple software? Schools that only let white children attend? Filling stations that only allow certain makes of cars to fill up? \u00a0(Wait, sorry, bad examples. Have it. Had it. Will soon have it...)Not the world I want to live in!

This place is fantastic! Living in Bucktown gives me easy access to some of the best neighborhood joints in the city and Piece is right up there with the best. The hubs and I enjoy coming here for a weeknight or weekday date night to grab a casual bite to eat. The beer list is amazing with all of the in-house brews ranging from wheats to pale ales to any and all darker brews. I can't say I have a favorite because it depends on the style of beer I have a taste for. Needless to say, no selection has ever disappointed. When we're feeling especially hungry we usually start with the goat cheese appetizer. It's warm, gooey cheese in a spicy marinara served with garlic bread. Mmmm, yum and that's just the warm-up to the pizza. In Chicago we are spoiled by the variety and styles of pizza and you can't really compare a deep-dish to a thin crust. They're totally different tastes in my opinion. However, Piece would be a front-runner of the thin crust variety. Extremely generous portion sizes, 3 different base styles (red, plain & white. We usually go traditional with red) and a slew of toppings ranging from classic pepperoni to the more obscure clams, artichokes and meatballs. If you come with a group, it's fun to have everyone choose a topping for a truly custom pie. Not only is Piece a great place to come for a sit-down meal but they're delicious fare is available for carry-out or delivery. This past weekend we stopped in on Sunday night to pick up a large pie and a growler to the fantastic tune of only $25!! Toppings are not included so that did add a few bucks to our cost but nonetheless it's a steal. We had more than enough food for dinner Sunday, Monday's lunch and a snack. Of course we didn't leave the beer around too long, it's just too good, so now we have an empty growler that we can fill to the tune of $12 the next time we stop by Piece. The only downer to Piece is that it's so good that everyone likes to come and the place can get super packed. It's not uncommon to wait an hour on the weekends. I can't fault a place for being so delicious, I'm just suggesting a weeknight meal over a weekend one. Other notes include a dessert menu I've yet to try, I like to drink my dessert personally, and bloody mary specials on Sundays.

But I can stomach some obnoxious people in the crowd if the pizza is that good.So is it? Meh. I will say it's a solid thin crust pie. The crust is really, really good. But there were several execution problems when we were there:1. Runny sauce. I mean, seriously? This led to:2. Soggy middle. A cardinal pizza sin, in my book. The runny sauce definitely contributed to the soggy middle. While the rest of the crust was near perfection, the soggy middle just screams amateur and almost ruined it for me.3. No crispy pepperoni. This might just be my personal thing, but if your oven is hot-hot-hot (as it should be to get that crust) then the pepperoni should crisp up nice. It didn't.We did have a \"red\" pizza... I'd love to try the white, because I am a man who loves him a white slice. However, \"New Haven\" style (no cheese) can pretty much shove off back east. Cheese or it ain't a pizza.

Though I enjoy pizza, I don't usually crave it.I'd definitely recommend the white pizza with goat cheese - I'm a huge goat cheese fan. It was delicious - and while it's not the best pizza I've ever had, it was quite enjoyable. My two guy friends ordered a pizza with sardines (or anchovies, one of the two) and pepperoni - and they didn't seem to happy with their order. I think that was largely in part to their \"great\" idea with those ingredients... yuck.For appetizers, we had the guacamole and the goat cheese appetizer. The guacamole was good - nothing special, but the goat cheese app was incredible. The only downside is that there isn't much bread included, so it's safe to assume you'll be ordering more bread (it's like a dollar extra, maybe.) I'd suggest ordering two batches of bread prior so your dip doesn't get cold like ours did... but I still wanted to lick the bowl, even when it WAS cold.For beer, we three enjoyed the Victoria IPA. We know nothing about \"quality\" beer (I may or may not stick to PBR most of the time for price reasons) but it was great and even better paired with pizza. I'd definitely recommend.Last but not least, the service was good. We had a nice waitress who was pretty attentive and didn't give us an attitude - like I've read on other reviews. I will say that it's a cozy atmosphere - it's warm in temperature and you may have to sit extremely close to other tables if you aren't at the high-tops... but all in all, I'm definitely going back!", "Date": "2012-10-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kristin S.", "ReviewID": "-EtnogrOzq3lsuHUPbw90Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best pizza hands down in Chicago. \u00a0I love, love, love this place. \u00a0Everything I have ever had here has been EXCELLENT. \u00a0We take lots of friends in from out of town here and everyone thinks this place is awesome. \u00a0I just want to highlight 2 things. \u00a0My favorite pizza-- white pizza, spinach, mushroom, garlic and my favorite salad--piece green salad - field greens, grape tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, sliced pears, topped off with gorgonzola cheese and candied pecans. \u00a0Come on. \u00a0The dressing is a light vingerette that is fabulous. \u00a0I would eat at Piece ANYTIME, ANYWHERE. \u00a0Yummers. \u00a0The wait can be a bitch, as this place is very popular.", "Date": "2013-01-04", "Author_Location": "Western Springs, IL"}, {"Author": "Johnny W.", "ReviewID": "22OzKbALTo75wNErmpHVvg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Food was good.

What more can I say?...well...to start it's not Chicago Style. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some Gino's or Lou's, but when you're in the mood for the perfect thin crust pizza you come here. It's unique in that they model their pizza after a joint out of New Haven. It's served on really large rectangular metal baking sheets, so it takes up most of a 2 seater table. I went with a friend and got a medium. We both ate 2 pieces each and there were still like 8 pieces left...and they WEREN'T small pieces! My only complaint was that they put the leftovers in too small of a box so many of the pieces were folded over to make it all fit. If you take home leftovers, check the box before leaving if you want your pizza to not be a sandwich the next day. My bf ended up eating the leftovers for three diff meals. The price was perfect and the service was ok. Not outstanding but ok. One thing to note is their great beer selection as this is a microbrewery. Also, I'm not a fan of pepperoni unless it's cooked my way and not too spicy and this was perfect. Nice and crispy, smooth flavored with a little kick, but not a lot. My bf and I have been struggling to find a place that can satisfy both our needs for pepperoni as he likes a thicker spicier type than I do. This one did the trick!

The other pizza we had was a red with sausage, mushrooms, garlic, and basil. This was good but not memorable. And again, the crust left me wanting. Piece is recognized for brewing their own beer of which my brothers were big fans of the various ones they had. Our server was friendly and efficient. The space is much smaller than it looks from outside so most evenings there will be a wait. On a recent Sunday around 6pm we waited 45 minutes to be seated. The noise level can get somewhat loud especially if there is a game playing on one of the TVs. The bar was crowded with people waiting for a table. On Sundays, Piece does a special $25 carry out deal that includes a large pizza and a growler of beer. Check their website for details as well as to see what beers are currently on tap.

You can choose from an extensive beer list, but best to go with one of their rotating selection of house-brewed beers (you can even take a growler home with you). And since the large pizza is as big as a table, they put it up on a little tower so your plates and beers can still have room underneath it. I guess it also helps keep with the \"cheese transfer process\", haha.One comment I will make- they have 3 types of pizza, traditional red, new haven style (no mozzarella) and white (no sauce).

My friend literally took the inside of his turkey sandwich and put it on the other half so that there was substance (hard to do on a tuna melt though). The service was rather slow.

It's definitely of the the pre-cooked frozen variety and doesn't work at all next to the rest of the suburb topping options. Side note the place is staffed almost entirely by hipsters and hippies.

Just to name a few there is Ripasso for high end authentic Italian, Schwa for the wildest Michelin star meal imaginable, Violet Hour for creative cocktails in a chic ambiance, Big Star for tacos, Mindy's Hot Chocolate for James Beard winning desserts and so much more. While Chicago has the reputation for being a mecca for deep dish pizza, growing up on the East coast I have always preferred thin crust. Piece is widely regarded as one of Chicago's best thin crust pizza venues. As my condo was taken over by a large group of women (my wife was throwing a baby shower) I met up with a buddy for some pizza and beer (Piece is also a brewery and makes there own beer - but supplements their menu with additional craft beers).My prior visits to Piece have been during dinner where Piece is usually packed to the gills, extremely loud and has a lengthy wait for a table. They do open daily at 11:00am for lunch and I arrived just before opening and was the first inside. Piece has the ambiance of a typical microbrewery with the only difference being it is also a pizza joint. The main dining room is quite large, loud and there is a very casual ambiance (in fact one of the servers made for some good people watching; she looked kind of like Miley Cyrus will look like in a couple of years after she obtains a few more tattoos and piercings). There are several televisions (generally displaying sporting events) and the music plays a variety of Hip Hop and rock. The crowd is mainly young and with pizza being featured there are far more families with children (especially during the daytime) than at a typical brewery. We started off our lunch with a round of beer. I perked up a bit when our server asked for my ID thinking that perhaps there was a senior discount; I quickly slipped her a fake ID (as I am not quite yet a senior citizen) but alas she simply had somehow confused me as a teenager. Aside from this she provided us with fairly good service. At lunchtime the pizzas are quite a deal; they offer personal pizzas for just $6 to $8 (depending on the number of toppings). While if you have a hearty appetite you may need to order two (or an appetizer), they are decent sized for the price. There are a ton of toppings to choose from with your typical items as well as some interesting choices such as mashed potatoes. You also pick from three different styles of pizza - Red (traditional), White (no tomato sauce) and New Haven style (no mozzarella cheese). \u00a0I opted for a \"white\" pizza with clams, mushrooms and bacon. The pizza was (as usual) \u00a0flavorful and very good and the beers decent. If you are in the mood for some good thin crust pizza in a lively, energetic atmosphere Piece is a great choice. If you go in the evening (especially on a weekend) do be prepared to wait unless you arrive real early (or have a party of ten or larger in which case you can make a reservation). At least you can quaff some of their brewskis as you wait and engage in some good people watching to help pass the time.", "Date": "2012-08-05", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Rene N.", "ReviewID": "x_iqraboVR59yLpfl0ybLQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is going to be my third review (the first two were flagged and taken down) and I will try to write it without cussing. \u00a0I hit this place hard with my drunk out of town friend with her drunk out of town entourage last night. \u00a0Walk in, 10:10pm.The hostess doesn't say hello but promptly informs us that the kitchen closes at 10:30pm and that we have 20 minutes to put our order in. \u00a0At this point we are well aware of the immediacy of the situation, decide on what to get while we wait for the table and are ready to go. \u00a0What follows next seems like deliberate stalling. \u00a0The server brings us water, says he'll be right back but disappears. \u00a0He emerges off in the distance and goes back into the kitchen. \u00a0There's only one other table there and a small party in the front in addition to our party of seven. \u00a0Finally with 5 minutes left to kitchen closing, one of our friends gets up to ask about our server and she tells him he'll be right out and when he does show up, he's got 'tude to spare. \u00a0We tell him the pizza we want, ask for two pitchers, are shot down on both counts and not given recommendations. \u00a0We ask for two different kinds, that he can do. \u00a0The rest of the meal went pretty alright except until the middle or what they perceived to be the end because he came up to our table while we were still eating to ask if we wanted the check now. \u00a0I've had some rude experiences here before and this one falls right in line with the rest of them. \u00a0We were out by 11:30pm. \u00a0Their pizza = nothing special.", "Date": "2010-03-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Erika A.", "ReviewID": "7mLprhKsV7pVoNW60OSWAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "god i love a great micro brewery!

I figured I'd be fair since I've only been here one time (& probably won't be back).I was really excited to have lunch here while we were in Wicker Park, after reading the reviews. However, our experience basically sucked, for the following reasons:1. Our waitress, who seemed like she'd be a good one at first, was basically nonexistent throughout the rest of our stay. Two or three tables who were seated after us received their food before us, and I know for a fact it wasn't because our food was taking a long time to be cooked (see point 2 below). It was because our waitress was nowhere to be found. We asked one of the many employees who were just hanging around the front of the restaurant (see point 3 below) to check on our food, and he sort of wandered over in the direction of our waitress, who was at the bar -- I don't even think he spoke to her -- and then wandered back and sort of mumbled to us, \"Yeah, your waitress'll check on it in a minute.\" Nice. Not surprisingly, she disappeared again after bringing us our food, and ultimately we had to send yet ANOTHER hanging-about-at-the-counter employee to get her, because it was taking way too long to pay -- and this time it was sort of funny, because I watched him as he went all over the restaurant looking for her, in and out of doors and all around. Took him forever to find her, WHO KNOWS what she had been doing.2. The food may have been good, or it may have been really good, if it had not been left sitting out under the heat lamps for WAY too long. This is how I know that our slow service was the result of our waitress, not the cooks. My pizza had the hugest, grossest pool of grease that had collected in the middle (took about 5 napkins to sop it up), and my boyfriend's tuna melt was blackened on the edges, with cheese that was barely recognizable as such. Even his potato chips were hot, another sign that it had been left sitting under the heat lamp. As it was, the pizza wasn't bad -- I could tell that it may have been really good if it had been fresher -- but toward the end of it I found a long hair on one of the pieces. It could have been my own (although I doubt it, because of the way it was lying on the pizza), but it still skeeved me out too much to continue eating.3. Seriously, what's up with the three or four employees who were constantly just hanging out at the front, leaning against the counter, reading the newspaper, whatever? Why are they here? What are they getting paid to do? Is there really absolutely no job that can be found for them to accomplish -- such as getting our food, for instance? Inefficiency really frustrates me, especially since we specifically ASKED one of them to do something for us and he blatantly did NOT.I really wanted to like this place.

Get an expansive location in a burgeoning neighborhood (not one which had yet to 'flip'). It also helps if you have a celebrity co-owner.Piece also was cognitive to cover its ass by offering guest beers on draft. Brewmaster Jonathan Cutler has shown distinctiveness in most of his recipes. I will remember the time he brewed an American-Style Malt Liquor [think \"Olde English 800\"], and served it in a small brown paper bag. It was better than I expected.However your beer style preferences tilt, there will be a beer here of which you can consume multiple pints.From most indications, this venue will get higher ratings now that the State of Illinois' smoking ban has gone into effect. The penultimate time I was here, it was so crowded (on a Friday night) at 7:30 pm that after 20 minutes of being unable to get close enough to the bar to place an order, I left here for another Bucktown bar for 3 hours. After 10:10 pm, it was more manageable. There are a bunch of television sets tuned to a variety of satellite channels [DirecTV]. I even espied GOL-TV [the bilingual 24-hour soccer channel] on one of them.The venue *used to be* a participant in the 'AHA Pub Discount Program'. It has ceased being such. I keenly recommend telling your waitstaff there that it should reinstate.The pizzas here are good. The 'New Haven'-style pizza is especially satisfying. (Regardless of what you specify for the pizza, try each of the shakers containing additional seasonings which will accompany it. I settled on the grated cheese.)Is Piece a destination in and of itself? Yes. But, if you wind up in the Milwaukee | Damen | North neighborhood for some other establishment, you should stop in here.Transit Options: Another massive incongruity of the CTA is that the #50 Damen bus, which could connect you to a number of beerworthy venues, ceases running at 10:00 pm (northbound) - 11:15 pm (southbound). If I was on the CTA Board, I would have this route running between (at least) the Brown Line \"L\" station [4700 N.] and the Pink Line's Polk station [800 S., 1730 W.] 24 hours a day.The way out is the Blue Line \"L\"'s Damen station. The Blue Line is the 'distant cousin' of all the rapid transit lines. It has one connection to the remainder of the system. It is undergoing major track rehabilitation (on a 25-year-old section! - guess who felt she so urgently needed a public works accomplishment on her record before the next election that this was constructed so shabbily?). You might encounter single-track operation. On weekends, you might discover the line has been broken in two, and you will have to take a shuttle bus between the disconnected portions.

The first time I went to Piece I had an AWESOME time. I heard about Piece on Check Please and decided to go there with a friend. We went on a Saturday night, and the wait was an hour. We were told to wait by the bar and they would \"come find us\". I was a little skeptical. The place was JAM PACKED. I wouldn't be able to find Michael Jordan here, more or less two people who were drinking beer, blending in with the crowd. So we waited, and waited, and waited. At times, we got yelled at by servers who were trying to get to the computer (which is understandable) but there was no where else to stand. So after 4 beers, and 1 1/2 hours gone by, we decided to ask the hostess our status. Apparently we were called, but as I stated before, the place is like the most popular bar in a college town on a Friday night, so OBVIOUSLY we didn't hear it. We were seated about 10 minutes later (YAY!!) and ordered right away. We had the spinach dip (good, but not anything amazing) and a large pizza, half mashed potato, half veggie. The pizza came out fairly quickly (about 15-20 min). I was very curious to try the mashed potato side and when I did, I was HAPPY! It was actually pretty good! The veggie side was good as well. It was thin and I love the way it comes on a sheet tray...very casual, very efficient. I raved about this place to my friend, so I decided to take her a few months later. We went on a Saturday night again, and we were told the wait was about 50 min to an hour. However, we were called in about a half and hour! We sat down and ordered the guacamole and a medium half cheese, half feta, spinach and broccoli pizza. The guac was Okay, it wasn't fantastic. The pizza was....BAD. The crust was HARD and it was so hard to bite through. In addition to this, there was barely any cheese on it, and they forgot the broccoli. When the waitress came over, we explained the problems to her and in return we got a \"Well if you feel that there is something wrong with it, then I can send over the manager, would you like that??\" So I said yes. The manager proclaimed that the pizza was \"new haven! new haven!\" and that this was the way it was supposed to be. He agreed that yes, \"i can see that there are areas here and there where there isn't any cheese, but for the most part, this is the way it's supposed to be!\" Okay......let me say this. I'm not one of those crazy people who go to restaurants and are SO picky that I complain about everything. I RARELY complain, more or less ask for the manager. I have been around the restaurant business most of my life and have worked in a restaurant for almost 9 years so I KNOW the ins and outs of crazy people who complain for no reason and I would NEVER do that. However, I have been to this restaurant before, experienced good pizza here and yes i KNOW what new haven style pizza is! I turned my slice over and saw that there were areas that were black underneath (which explained the hardness). That was it, I went back to munching on the guac, eyeing the pizza at the table next to us enviously, until the bill came. Even though we managed to eat half the pizza because we were hungry, we went out for Thai food afterward because were were so unsatisfied. This is something a restaurant should never want to accomplish. The first time I went to Piece I had a good time, the second time I had an awful time. I'm not sure if I would want to go here again after the last experience, but the memories of the first experience is why I give it 3 stars.", "Date": "2009-02-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Amanda M.", "ReviewID": "VNVIHF8XmErPENYhZN9dXg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The food is amazing and the beer is REALLY amazing, but the management was terrible. \u00a0We waited FOREVER for a table and the staff could have done more to accommodate our group. \u00a0The price wasn't too bad for the pizza but the drinks were pretty expensive!", "Date": "2009-02-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Joscelyn M.", "ReviewID": "bsLUwGEL8ubXbGgR7RkDow", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love pizza. \u00a0I'm of the firm belief that even bad pizza is good because it's still pizza. \u00a0I like Piece because it's a cool place to hang out with a great beer selection and eat my favorite food. \u00a0But, I'm really not that hot on the pizza itself. \u00a0It has a weird combo of either being too soggy in places or too crusty in other places. \u00a0I'm a huge fan of the pizza at Santulo's a few doors down. \u00a0If I want pizza, I go there. \u00a0If I want yummy beer and some ok food alongside it, I go to Piece.", "Date": "2009-11-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ashley K.", "ReviewID": "KSCnvtdAOEoZ0FX0iK_jJw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The threat of a long wait usually keeps me from frequenting here as often as I would like and the threat of soggy pizza always keeps me from getting it to go, but this pizza is off the hook. \u00a0A true Chicagoan, my pizza preference is deep dish (Lou Malnati's sausage and spinach please) but when I want a good thin crust fix, Piece does it for me. \u00a0Yes it's loud, and yes, I generally get stuck in a small table in between two large parties so I can't really hear myself think, but whatever, stick a piece of pizza in my mouth and I'm good. \u00a0One visit my friend requested broccoli and my initial thought was \"I think I just threw up in my mouth\" but since I'm trying to work on my compromising skills, I agreed, provided there was something else I could cover up the taste with. \u00a0Turns out, I love broccoli on pizza. \u00a0Well, on Piece's pizza anyway. \u00a0It gets all roasted and crispy and doesn't taste anything like the broccoli I used to douse in ranch dressing and choke down when my mom made it growing up. \u00a0I doubt I'd order it on my own but if it was requested, I wouldn't say no. \u00a0The crispy crust managed to not taste like cardboard, which is what you usually find on thin crust pizza. \u00a0Not only did it manage to not taste like cardboard, it was buttery and delicious! \u00a0 \u00a0My biggest gripe is that the appetizer section is relatively small. \u00a0When this place is packed, it can take a while to get your pizza, which means I need something to nibble on, lest I try to take a chunk out of the arm of one of my dining companions. \u00a0I've had the spinach dip and it's good - but I just wish they'd throw a few more options out there.", "Date": "2012-01-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Rebecca H.", "ReviewID": "6n-lmRkCde2Dj94RZU2Ycg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love thin crust and there were many different options to choose from.

Word on the street was that they make good pizza and brew award winning beer - and there's always a long wait. This thursday we learned all three are true. I'm a Chicago deep dish pizza lover at heart so it's hard for me to get too excited about various thin crust options but piece makes a solid thin crust. They call it \"new haven\" style but that's likely just marketing. There are no pre-set pizzas to choose, everything is build your own and starts with one of four sauces: red, bbq, white and plain. Even though we arrived on the later end at 8:15 we still waited at least 45 minutes for a table and the place was always packed (maybe for thursday night karaoke??). I loved the feel and decor of the barn/brewery style. I could picture it on the side of a ski mountain out west if you added a fireplace and the loud noise of ski boots. The brand name beer was very good and deserving of the many awards decorating the walls. Ari and I enjoyed a sampler flight to make sure we didn't miss anything. Lastly, the value was surprisingly good. Three pizzas, one starter and some drinks we ended up at $20 a person all in with leftovers.We started with a very tasty and perfectly sized spinach and cheese dip with tortilla chips. We were all very hungry and needed something before the pizza arrived. I don't know exactly how long we waited but it didn't seem out of the ordinary. We choose three different kinds of pizza to try and share - red sauce, white sauce and bbq sauce. The bbq had mushrooms, the red had pepperoni and onion and the white was artichoke, spinach and broccoli. Each pie had different strengths and all were tasty. My favorites were either the bbq or the pepperoni depending on the minute. I thought all the pizzas actually tasted better the more they cooled as the sauce became more firm and the crust hardened. The bbq would have been even better with a protein like chicken or something to go with the sweetness of the sauce. I did like the veggie white pizza but just not as much as the other two. All of the beers were very good, which is an accomplishment when there are six to try. My favorite was the anniversary ale.I'm happy that our experience lived up to the good press and word of mouth. I would happily spend nights there drinking beer on a cold and snowy evening or a nice summer night like last week. The biggest complaint is the long wait for a table and sometimes the staff is a little preoccupied with themselves than the guests. The pizza's good, the beer's great and the value surprising.

As you no doubt follow my every word, you know I am not a fan of excessive garlic, and even though the menu plainly states that the sauce contains garlic (so don't get me wrong here, I am *not* blaming Piece in the slightest), it was far more garlic than I personally was prepared to deal with.

For those of you who have never experience the awesomeness that is mashed potato and bacon pizza, you are truly missing out. The second and third pizzas were mostly for the rookies who doubted the awesomeness of the first pizza. The second one was a red pie with spinach, mozzarella and banana peppers. The banana peppers were key in this pizza -- they brought a relatively plain, but good slice to a much higher level of amazingness (the little red line is telling me that amazingness is not a word, but whatever). The third pizza was much more classic -- red with mozzarella, tomato and basil. It was good, as expected, but nowhere near as good as the other two pizzas.I downed all this pizza with some Golden Arm and Dark-n-Curvy Dunkelweizen.

My Fiancee and I went on a Thursday and SCORE it was a Karaoke Night, good for us because we love singing Karaoke! It was extremely crowded and we were told it would be at least an hour wait for a table so we muscled out way to the bar and had a Drink noticing the list was moving fast. After about 30 minutes a spot at the Bar opened as our name was called but we decided to sit at the Bar and eat. I loved the fact that you can order 3 different styles of Pizza but not feeling adventurous that night we went with the regular Pizza with Sausage, Peperoni and Bacon. I ordered the Camel Toe Draft Beer which is House Brewed and loved it! The Pizza turned out Excellent! Thin crust,Tasty sauce and meats and cooked to Perfection! OK so now our tummies r full and the buzz is kickin in from the 9.5% ABV Beers so now it's time for Karaoke. So we pick our songs and get the request slips in early. The tone-deaf host starts the show off with a horrible song and you notice the non-karaoker's start leaving which was unfortunate because most of the singers were Great. We got up about 10 singers in and ROCKED the House! My Fiancee sang Black Velvet and had everyone singing along and dancing. I was up next and asked if I could get some help on stage with an Air Band and 3 girls came up to help, I sang On the Dark Side and had everyone in the crowd clapping and singing along with the help of my Awesome Air Band. That was so fun and the crowd showed their appreciation. The rest of the singers were great too but after a while we noticed that the Tone-Deaf Host was singing more and other singers were singing 2 and 3 more times. After almost an hour and a half people were leaving they were telling us how good we were and they were wondering why we weren't called back up yet. I guess we upstaged the host and his regulars or something so I asked if we were going to get to sing again and he said yes. I saw our request slips and it looked like we were next but after watching more singers sing their 3rd song so we decided to just leave. Anyway to sum it up the Pizza was Excellent the Beer was Fantastic, the service was good and the crowd was Fun. Too bad they have a Karaoke Service with a Host that cant sing but does it often. Oh well I'm not gonna hold that against Rick...lol... but I sure will come back on a non-karaoke night or maybe check out their Live Band Karaoke on a Saturday.", "Date": "2011-07-17", "Author_Location": "Berwyn, IL"}, {"Author": "Kristen S.", "ReviewID": "0mDM16lJqtvmso-xiSCimQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Beer gets 4 stars, pizza gets 2.

Piece makes a thin crust pizza and that approaches the cracker style pizza as it comes out crispy but not quite that thin. I'm more of the belief that pizza crust should be chewy and pliable but I appreciate that Piece has their thing and does it well. I went with a New Haven style pizza (red sauce and shredded parm but no mozzarella) and really liked this style as I often say that cheese is often used to cover up mistakes. No mistakes here though as their sauce is legit. One of the best red sauces I've had. Their toppings are also fresh and awesome as our sauteed mushrooms were much more impressive than mushrooms you usually find on pizza. Given the sauce and toppings if the crust was more my style this might be my favorite pizza place ever and I haven't even talked about the beer yet. They offer their own brews as well as guest taps.

I arrived at around 6PM to a nearly empty place but by 8PM, the whole room was full and bustling. BU Alumni events are often held there because of the owner's own alumnus status. Winters are for watching the BU Terriers kill their competition in the Bean Pot, a phenomenon not usually experienced by midwesterners. The ambience is convivial, the pizza is out of this world, and the beer...oh the beer. They do sell growlers of their home brews and it seems that next time, I'll have to buy my own supply of the Top Heavy.

After being in Chicago a few years I was going nuts, jonesing for some good ol' NY-style pizza instead of deep dish or crispy-thin pizza! After asking around a bit, a friend recommended Piece. \"That's where one of the guys from The Real World - Chicago worked,\" she added helpfully. Ok, so I could care less about The Real World tv show, too; I just wanted some good ol' NY-style pie! A friend and I headed over on a Tuesday night. Even though it was pouring outside, the place was packed. Service was very good; my only complaint would be that the accoustics were bad so it was incredibly noisy inside, and it made it hard to converse. But, oh!, the pizza! As an East coast transplant, I have to say that this may be some of the best thin-crust pizza I've had! I think they call it \"New Haven style\" - I'm honestly not sure how that differs any from NY style. To wash it all down, order one of their own-brewed beers - and if you like the beer, you can take a \"growler\" of any of their 7 microbrews to go.

One time my girlfriend and I had to ask these guy's behind us to please quit yelling in our ear's, and we like loud music and having fun, however when some drunkin jock yuppie deusch bag is literally yelling directly in you're ear, it becomes very annoying to say the least.And the waitstaff became very rude and unfriendly, don't know when or how it happened however it did.

To sum it up, if your looking for home made brews and pizza with interesting ingredient choices than Piece is your pie in the sky.
