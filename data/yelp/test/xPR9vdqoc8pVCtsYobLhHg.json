I made reservations through opentable, and was promptly seated. Just a heads up that this place has community seating, but I requested that we sit on the end. The menu changes daily, so keep in mind that some of the stuff I ordered will not always be there. We ordered the potted rilletes, half order of serano, half charcuterie plate, duck breast, clam fry, frites, and bbq carrots. Everything was very good, but our least favorite was the clam fry. The fries and carrots were surprisingly top notch. I would recommend getting some sort of cured meat and the charcuterie also allows you to try different types. It actually took forever for all of our food to get out, which is why I would dock it a star, but the waiter offered us a complimentary plate which was very kind of him. I want to come back for brunch to get the bacon, as this place clearly knows how to cook some pork. I highly recommend and I will come back again.", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Katie D.", "ReviewID": "l781_BWnXFVO1op6xDSv9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By far the best meal I've had in Chicago.

A gorgeous presentation with perfectly seared duck and fresh accompaniments. \u00a0Loved every bite of this!** Dessert -- Kumquat panna cotta with sweet tea, thai basil, and honey caramel. \u00a0This dessert was so gorgeous that I didn't want to disturb it. \u00a0But once I did, it was heavy in my mouth -- sweet, silky, spicy, smooth, and luxurious.Service at the Publican is casual but knowledgeable. \u00a0All the servers were running around especially frantically, outfitted in their signature khaki blazers, but there seemed to be a controlled chaos to the whole thing.Can't wait to pay the Publican another visit next time I'm in Chicago -- and hopefully eat up the rest of the West Loop while I'm at it! \u00a0=)", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Dina D.", "ReviewID": "JRNw_r7lzL1r_OA5E6X34Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Publican is a great place to bring friends and talk over great food. More pork-centric than its other sister restaurants, the Publican shines when it delivers porky goodness. It's another communal table style restaurant, where you'll sit at a long table or at the bar elbow to elbow with strangers.We started with the Potted Rillettes, a small jam-sized jar of duck and pork, topped with strawberries and served with excellent toasted rustic bread. It's kind of a build-your-own open faced sandwich, and the flavor of the meat coupled with the occasional strawberry is surprisingly good.The Barbecue Carrots were a spicy and flavorful standout, served with creamy herb dressing, dill and pecans. The carrots are various types of heirlooms, all delicious. It's a combination of flavors that I wouldn't have thought of, but it works very well together. The combination of the herb dressing and barbecue spices is not to be missed. Our main meals were not quite as flavorful as our first courses, although they were still very well prepared. The Country Rib, served with romesco, spring onions and turnip, was obviously cooked by someone who knows how to cook great pork, and and lightly seasoned. It was their choice to flavor the meat lightly so that the quality can shine, which it did, but I still found myself wanting a bit more flavor since the other flavor combinations we had here were so unique and excellent.The Yellowtail, served with wax beans, green beans and cherry tomatoes was interesting, in a delicate, creamy kind of sauce. The fish was a bit fishy tasting, but was excellently prepared. Overall, I found the flavors of this dish didn't meld quite so well as other choices on the menu.For dessert we had the Panna Cotta, flavored with sweet tea, kumquats, thai basil and honey caramel. This is a truly unique dessert, and I found the strong flavors of the thai basil and kumquat to work well together. It is certainly one of the more unique desserts I have tried.Overall, it seems that The Publican effectively straddles the line between great quality food prepared simply and taking unique flavor combinations to the next level. If you have a group of people that includes both foodies and meat and potatoes types, everyone will be able to find something to their taste here.", "Date": "2014-07-05", "Author_Location": "Columbus, IN"}, {"Author": "s r.", "ReviewID": "TCp27IY9ubmrChX764HRMg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Place is pork heavy.

The brought out a bunch of their signature sharing plates for all of us to share, and then after that I had the mussels - yummy broth, large portion, served with a warm baguette on the side. A few of the girls ordered the sea bass and it came half-raw, and all three of them had to send it back, it was that awful.

Why you ask? For starters, I'm a vegetarian, and if the gargantuan portraits of swine that line the walls are any indication, this place dabbles heavily in meat-centric fare, with a heavy emphasis on all things hog. Secondly, the group I was with had nary an adventurous eater in the bunch, though my dad does get an honorable mention for at least dabbling in some of the more out-of-the-box fare.The layout of the restaurant has long tables in the center of the room where diners are seated communal style, with booths lining the perimeter (done in the style of a pen; \u00a0like I said, the swine theme abounds)...On a busy Saturday, we arrived at 8pm for our reservation, but our table wasn't ready, so we went to the bar area to have a round of drinks. Within 15 minutes, we were seated and greeted by our server. He explained the menu- this is done family style, though it is a bit confusing in terms of how large each plate is/how much food is necessary for a given group. It seems like typical diners order a good half dozen or more plates for a group of four. We ordered a handful of plates ourselves, with the main crux being vegetarian dishes (the chef even has a vegetarian special where they create a trio of veggie delights). This was one of the larger plates, along with the charcuterie plate (a large plate of several meat offerings, including sausages and meat pies). We ordered most of the vegetarian offerings, the best being the bbq carrots (incredibly flavorful with a spicy kick) and the strawberries, which were ridiculously tasty with a lively balsamic reduction. We finished by splitting the angel food cake dessert, a recent addition to the menu.Beyond being a cool spot, the service is what truly garners Publican 5 stars. While many other trendy restaurants with inventive menus would have been quick to dismiss a group like ours that was so clearly out of our element, our server patiently helped us navigate through the menu and dining experience, all the while maintaining a healthy dose of humor.

Sadly we didn't get a chance to really savor all the different styles and flavors because our next plates including veggies and main course were rushed to our table. I found the timing to be really inappropriate.

I could probably eat all that sweet fattiness by my lonesome. Frites w fried egg was good (fries were perfectly crispy). Steak tartine was amazing as well. Hash browns were just meh. Pork shoulder were good but I wouldn't order that again. However, the service was appalling. We went on a Sunday around 1pm. We were seated and our drink orders were taken. Then all the sudden, the waitress forgot we existed. I called another waitress over (as ours was no where to be seen), and asked if she could take our order. The first thing she says is (with an arrogant attitude): \"well you know I'm not your waitress right??\". GEEZ LOUISE. I responded \"Yes, I know. However, ours is no where to be seen and if you don't want to take our order, can you please send her our way then?\". She ended up taking our order anyways. We ordered the 5 dishes (above), and only received 2/5. They remove all our dishes/plates/utensils and the waitress asks if there's anything else we need. Hm, yes. How about the 3 remaining dishes that we ordered? She was so confused. She had to ask us what we ordered, and I think that's when she placed the remaining order.

So, when I was eating meat, I knew this was a place that fit for me, and of course, their ever-changing menu and small plates are delicious so that doesn't hurt. They also try to use as much of the animal as possible, which again, falls in line with respecting the animals and viewing them as less of a commodity. 6 months later I became vegetarian, and yet continued to love The Publican, as they have excellent vegetable sides & mains, that highlight seasonal produce in the most unique of ways, and truly make vegetables the stars.A year or so ago I transitioned to eating vegan exclusively, and while one may think The Publican would be the least accommodating place for me, it's the opposite. While there may not be any dedicated vegan options on the menu, they have been nothing but friendly, accommodating and creative in making something for me.

The oysters were fresh and I was satisfied with all of them, however the penn cove and pebble beach (Washington) were my favorite ones!When our bill came our waiter told us that the blueberry pie, bread, and drinks were on the house.

Usually establishments will tone down the pickled taste of the cabbage as well as the spice... to the point of almost no heat. The Publican did a great job of preserving the profile of the kimchi in this dish but, personally, it could have been spicier, nonetheless it was still great. Oh and the pork belly was phenomenal.My girlfriend had the limited offer lobster scrambled egg. This was one of those dishes that only happen when they have the ingredients; this so happened to be a day they had live lobster waiting to be boiled to death for our culinary pleasure. I had a few bites, and damn, it was worth every penny. I believe it was around $20 but hey, it's fresh lobster in Chicago, wmcyaf!?I highly recommend coming in a group, it is brunch after all, and sharing your dishes. I've heard their dinner menu is worth a try as well, so maybe we'll just have to have brunch again and then hang around for dinner!", "Date": "2014-04-28", "Author_Location": "Evanston, IL"}, {"Author": "Hollina U.", "ReviewID": "Lgdp_U95XTkzfD-lQJ5WNQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came here on a sunny afternoon and scored some patio seats. While sitting on the patio was nice, it was kind of narrow, and the waiter and people passing by kept bumping into the table and menus on the table, making it feel too squished. Ordered the ballisto something, which was pork and duck confit--- the pork was delicious, but the duck confit part was just ok. The marinated broccolini was really good as well--- but just a heads up that this dish is cold. Not an issue for me though. My brother ordered the country ribs, which were dry-- I definitely was not impressed by that. What drops a star for this rating is just my overall experience and feel of the place. For the prices that I'm paying, I want exceptional service. If I'm paying $35 for the main dish AND have to pay $12 for some veggies, then I want some damn good service... which I didn't feel like I got. First of all, I get that some restaurants don't seat incomplete parties, but if 2 people of a party of 3 are ready to eat and order, why can't the third just show up and order when he arrives? It's not like we would have waited just for him to arrive to order. My brother drinks like a fish and eats like a cow or whatever you would compare that too, so we would have ordered plenty. Arrived at 5 PM when they open, and there was no wait, and by the time my friend arrived at 6 PM, there was a 2 hour wait for a 4-top. I definitely was not in the mood for dessert or a drink after that. Plus if I just mentioned that two of my friends were coming and we want to know how long the wait for a 4 top is, and you say, two hours, then I definitely don't want dessert. \u00a0Also, if we're paying $50 a piece for our meal, I think the server should be wearing something more than a sweatshirt. Overall, the attitude of the hostesses is pretentious, the waiter was just blah and not so helpful (although I know I can be difficult when ordering--- but still I had much better service at a freaking bar earlier that day) and there just is something about this restaurant that doesn't click for me.

The clam chowder that had southwest flavors with mild heat and roasted peppers was excellent and the sourdough pancake with bacon wrapped chicken thigh and sausage was also good, just not crazy flavorful. I will say the star of the brunch was that little maple braised bacon and went well with the frites + fried eggs!

Shot in brilliant, mouthwatering HD, I was of course interested to try it. But when Anthony Bourdain gave his imprimatur on The Layover, I just knew that I had to eat here. Of course, all I really needed to know was that Paul Kahan was the chef. I was first introduced to Chef Kahan through Top Chef and No Reservations (yes, I watch a lot of food television) so I knew that his style of cooking -- new American rustic comfort -- would be right up my alley.The quaint outdoor patio of The Publican is a precious spot on a warehouse-lined street, which kind of reminds me of the trendy meatpacking district in NYC. But once you walk inside, the restaurant -- a large room with high ceilings, globe lighting, communal tables, and animal pens -- is more reminiscent of a pig barn-cum-beer hall. It's both casual and clever, kind of like the food. We started with the Yellowtail Crudo, which was simply dressed with citrus, olive oil, pine nuts, and mint. It was wonderfully fresh and a great way to begin our meal. Then we moved on to half a Charcuterie Plate, which was very good with the exception of the cold and mediocre pork pie. I did love the variety of pickled vegetables, however. When it comes to charcuterie, you can never have enough pickles.Next was the Country Fried Egg, which was outrageously delicious. The crispy fried exterior gave way to a perfectly runny boiled egg inside. Accompanied with grilled asparagus, it was a clever riff on a classic dish. The final entree was, of course, the Pork Belly, a huge and tender slab of porcine indulgence coated in a sweet and savory glaze. I felt like a total pig devouring it, but hey, you are what you eat.All this meaty goodness was washed down with an amazing pale ale called Zombie Dust by Three Floyds Brewing in Indiana. Hoppier than most pale ales, it ranks up there as one the top 5 beers I have ever had. Just delicious stuff, and a real shame that it can't be found in California.Finally, the dessert kind of blew my mind. It was a Cheesecake that was accompanied by nothing other than funnel cake! Funnel cake, people! How awesome is that? It was topped with a raspberry sorbet and also dusted with this really interesting (perhaps Indian or Persian) spice. Hot, cold, creamy, tart, and savory: this dish had it all.In short, I loved my meal at The Publican.

I ordered a b=Bloody Mary with a small Wisconsin beer and waited for a spot to open up. Yes, as mentioned before in other posts there is a lot of communal seating.

Lobster wasn't overloaded, but enough that you were eating some and not having it in name only. The toast had a slight char to it which would be a negative normally, but was a wonderful positive with this meal. The taste of the toast mixed perfectly with the richness of the lobster and texture of the eggs. I ate every bite of the meal and could have had more.2) Apple Cider Donut - This thing was great. Very light, airy. The glaze was just right, not too sweet. You could taste the apple cider throughout the donut. I didn't get coffee, but if I did I would have had to ordered another one of these suckers.3) Pretzel - Wow. Man, I loved this sucker. Being in Philly you kind of have to have a soft spot for pretzels. This thing was absolutely perfect. Just enough salt, perfect size, the fresh cheese spread had enough red pepper to make it spicy, but not take away from the cheddar taste. \u00a0So good.

I got a little too tipsy, so I figured I'd treat the lady to a decent brunch to crawl my way out of the dog house. The Publican opens at 10:00 on Sunday, so we got here at 9:45 and we were the first to be seated. However, people were rolling in by the bunches despite the bad weather. The place was popping off anyway. Most of the seating is communal, and the booths on the edges are doored pig stalls. We sat communal and didn't mind the seating arrangements. The woman and I, feeling a bit hungover,had already established that being healthy was at the bottom of our priority list, and thus started off with the pork rinds and bacon. Both were delicious, though a bit overpriced. Pork rinds - $5 - Pork rinds that you would buy at a 711, except poured out of the bag into a metal cup. Good, but worth $5? No, probably not. Bacon - $7 - 2 thick pieces of maple syrup-glazed bacon. This was unbelievable. The bacon melts in your mouth and the maple syrup adds a nice touch. The best bacon I've had in my life. Worth the $7? Yes, this is why you come to The Publican. $7 for 2 thick pieces of bacon is expensive, but if you come here, you know you are going to overpay for some delicious food. If you are complaining about the prices, then that is your fault for the lack of research. We loved the appetizers, and were eagerly awaiting the 2 main dishes we ordered. She got the:Rock Crab Scramble - $19 - This is scrambled eggs mixed with some veggies and crab along with a few pieces of bread. It was pretty delicious, however after finishing she wished she would have ordered something else. Worth the $19? Honestly, no, not really. It's hard to screw up scrambled eggs. The Publican simply marked the price up about 300% because the dish contains crab. Still good though, like I said, we were aware of the prices before attending. Then my dish, which was the:Slagel Farm Sirloin Steak - $17 - Thinly cut pieces of rare-cooked sirloin steak on top of a large piece of sourdough bread. On top of the steak was a fried egg, some avocado, pico de gallo and cilantro. This plate was heavy and great for padding the tummy after liquor-filled night. Put me right to sleep after. The only gripe I have about the dish is that the steak was too chewy, which is to expect from sirloin. Thus, I place the blame on myself for the choice. It was still very good. Worth the $17? Yes, I would say it is, however next time I'll be getting something else. The girl and I departed a fat and happy young Chicago couple, giggling at the piglet who glared at us as we walked to the car. (Note: there a sign of a pig in front of the restaurant.

Here is what we tried:Excellent:-bouchet mussels (be sure to ask for bread)-boudin brase (i think this is what it was called. the menu changes often, but i would recommend whatever boudin dish they are serving that day. the sausage was fantastic)-porchetta (today's featured root veggies and a horseradish creme sauce)-scallopsVery Good:-farm chicken-cauliflower (today's was au gratin)We also tried the Kyle's After Pork digestif and a meringue / sorbet dessert that was light and wonderful.I definitely recommend trying The Publican (with a reservation!).", "Date": "2013-12-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Lisa H.", "ReviewID": "YbpmDWlgImkk86DIZlucMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Publican is another hyped up restaurant that I can finally cross off my bucket list. \u00a0Upon entering through the big glass doors, I noticed the restaurant gave off a rustic type of vibe with their oversize tables, chairs, and exposed wooden panels. \u00a0The dining concept here is really unique because it is a huge dining hall with large communal tables, \"pig pen\" booths, and a standing lounge.I came here for a friend's birthday with a party of four and were seated at the communal tables. \u00a0The server explained to us that the food is served almost like tapas style and was meant to be shared. \u00a0We decided on:Chefs Selection of Oysters: six different type of raw oysters selected by the chef. \u00a0I didn't try these out, but they were a decent size for the price. \u00a0My friends said they were pretty tasty and fresh.Bouchot Mussels (full order): mussels cooked in lambic bay, butter, celery, and garlic. \u00a0The broth the mussels were sitting in was amazing. \u00a0It wasn't too heavy that it overpowered the original taste of the mussels, but still gave off that buttery and garlic goodness.Charcuterie Plate (half order): finocchiona salumi, pork pie, headcheese, country p\u00e2t\u00e9, morteau sausage, pickles & mustards. \u00a0I'm not too sure what was what on this plate (even though they told us each item on the dish), but I enjoyed almost everything. \u00a0I just didn't like the pickles & mustard. \u00a0Something about sour and mustard didn't go well with each other.Pork Belly: glazed pork belly over a heaping mound of steel-cut oats. \u00a0I'm not a big fan of pork belly, but the thick cut pork belly was perfectly glazed and cooked. \u00a0The pork was so tender that once you put a knife to it, it just fell apart. \u00a0The steel-cut oats also was a great addition to the dish.Sweet Potato Gratin: sweet potato baked with cheese and spices. \u00a0This dish had the perfect balance between salt and sweet. \u00a0It also wasn't overpowered with cheese. \u00a0Overall, a delicious gratin.I have to say my experience here was different, but enjoyed it nonetheless. \u00a0I'm not a big fan of communal dining because I don't like how I can hear the conversations of everyone around me and vice versa. \u00a0Oh, did I mention that the bathroom is communal also? \u00a0Well it is! Three stalls for girls and 2 stalls for guys. \u00a0Weird huh?? \u00a0But I still would recommend you to give this place a try if you enjoy good food and looking for a unique dining experience.", "Date": "2013-12-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Saba A.", "ReviewID": "nHx1fQRZ3bac2ojcc9gAHg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I brought my husband here for a birthday surprise dinner on a Sunday night.

We ate half of it even though it was a half order. This is definitely a meat lovers place. They also have oysters on the list. People have raved to us about their meats so that's why we went. Save your appetite for this restaurant, and possibly try out their deli subs across the street and come here for brunch. I know I will sometime. Service: At the end, they gave my husband an eclair with a candle as they must have noted that I booked the reservation mentioning his birthday. As far as service, it was all right.

Ok, so this is partly my fault and I will accept SOME responsibility. My best friend had just arrived in town from VA and we had loads to catch up on. We had a 7PM reservation on a Thursday. We arrived and the restaurant had a decent crowd, but not overly crowded. We were ushered to the back corner of the restaurant near the the kitchen and an exit door for staff. We were seated at the corner of the table next to some ladies who had sprawled out as if they were in their own private booth. We took our seat and began to peruse the menu.Our waitress, Mary was friendly and explained that she would let us know if we were ordering too much or not enough food. We selected a bottle of wine and she left us to make our decisions. We selected mussels, octopus, half order of serrano and sweet potatoes. Mary staggered each of the dishes so they didn't all hit our tiny corner of the table all at once. The mussels were good, but didn't blow either of us away. The serrano was delectable, as to be expected. We both enjoyed the octopus. The sweet potatoes were huge and sweet enough to serve as dessert. We were content. Ok, so why the three stars? The back door was used throughout our meal and just an FYI it's cold outside. Every time the door was opened a cold draft hit our end of the table and trust me that doesn't make for an enjoyable dining experience. I would understand if there were no other open seats in the restaurant, some sucker has to sit there, but come on. Even as we left the restaurant there were open seats throughout. The other deduction of a star may not be within the restaurants control, but as I said, if there are other open seats available why stack us all on top of each other - especially those who thought enough to make a reservation in advance. The group of ladies (that I had mentioned earlier in the review) that had sprawled out were either, not familiar with communal seating or they simply had no regard for personal space. I didn't think that any of our conversations were that fascinating, but apparently they were a lot more interesting than what the group of four had to say. Seriously, 80% of our meal was spent with two of the group of four ladies continuously looking over as if we asked them to join us. My friend nor I could figure it out, but it was what it was and unfortunately, kept us from being able to fully experience the amazing meal so many rant about.

Grilled yellowtail was excellent, the Bouchon Mussels were huge and very tasty. The blood sausage, farm chicken and the Duck Breast were so mouthwatering I was thinking of ordering seconds for myself.

\u00a05 IS SO RESTRICTING.I made reservations about a week before I came in as I learned that day my dad was coming to town. \u00a0I've been told to come here plenty of times by friends and coworkers, and having tried PQM and Peasantry beforehand, I had nothing but the highest hopes for the flagship. \u00a0Making a reservation seemed like a good idea because of the restaurants high profile, even if it was later on a Wednesday. \u00a0The restaurant called twice to confirm my OpenTable rez, so they're either quite thorough or I have zero credibility. \u00a0Both are completely within the realm of possibility..My dad and I arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation and opted for the $8 valet since parking in the West Loop is apparently roughly as easy as finding a red line with no discernible urine odor. \u00a0The place looked to be about 75% full, which didn't really throw me off. \u00a0This has to be a great restaurant, right? \u00a0To our surprise, we were seated immediately...At the huge communal table, which was tighter than most airlines' economy class. \u00a0Our menus and beer/wine list more than covered our dining space and were printed on the size of paper I imagine historical documents, say the Magna Carta, are. \u00a0Very impressive was the beer list, but it took our waitress a solid 15 minutes to arrive and take our drink order. \u00a0My dad was already a scotch or two deep, but alas, I wasn't.To the right of my airline seat sat two DePaul sorority girls. \u00a0They were yelling, as was everyone else in the restaurant, because the designer thought it best to build the place in a style architecturally akin to a dining hall: high ceilings, hard surfaces everywhere, and nothing on the walls to dampen any of it. \u00a0The lighting also reminded me of a dining hall I frequented during my freshman year.After another 10 minutes of so of waiting for our beers, we thought it best to get our order out immediately. \u00a0I got the small charcuterie plate for us to split, lamb, and an order of squash. \u00a0My dad, the mussel stew. \u00a0I advised on something sausage-esque or at least pork, but he was set on seafood. \u00a0The charcuterie plate was a thing of beauty, with much more than your garden variety of meat treats; it was complete with blood sausage, pate, pork pie, and a few other fantastic selections, just enough for 2 to split. \u00a0Accompanying the plate was a basket of thick, crusty bread and a disk of wonderfully creamy butter. \u00a0With these two items along with our beers and waters, our dining area was at capacity. \u00a0How was this whole entree situation going to work?Logistically poorly, that's how. \u00a0They set down a cast iron dish on which to rest the stew and a small casserole dish with a ladle to give us an idea of how cramped this was about to get. \u00a0Around this time, we ordered more beer as our headaches from the noise grew, and they were delivered as our empty beer glasses and bottles sat there. \u00a0I barely ever care about poor table service (seriously, look at my other reviews), but our limited amount of real estate made every square inch count. \u00a0As this all took place, we were enclosed on our other side by other, less annoying diners.Although we were told dishes come out as they're ready (restaurant code for \"screw coordinating this stuff\"), the squash came out about 15 minutes before the other two entrees, and was either gone or cold by the time the others arrived. \u00a0It was fantastic, tender squash, with a hint of sweetness and overall a great seasonal fall side. \u00a0The lamb and stew came roughly at the same time and both were excellent. \u00a0The stew was chock full of surprisingly fresh mussels, the occasional medium-sized shrimp, and a bit of linguine, all in a complex, dark mushroom broth. \u00a0It certainly wasn't too salty, as many seafood stews tend to be. \u00a0The two cuts of lamb had excellent flavor and came on a bed of flavorful, aromatic greens, but most of the cuts were fat or bone and left much to be desired. \u00a0We opted out of dessert, and while the food was excellent overall, I can't help taking issue with the experience of it all. \u00a0Having to basically yell at my dad who sat in front of me while being elbowed by (and elbowing) coughing strangers made for a wholeheartedly disappointing experience. \u00a0I'd literally have rather sat at a fast food restaurant. \u00a0Maybe it's just me, but doesn't making a reservation a week in advance warrant a table?", "Date": "2013-11-19", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Becca L.", "ReviewID": "Xh5fVcliWvkNteE4xz4F_A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had the lobster scramble and hash browns.

I laugh when I say this but my bag of salt and vinegar, hot and spicy chicharon just does not compare. -Charcuterie plate is a little sample of what I've come to believe to be what Publican is known for--their meats. -Oysters are on point-Frites are tasty and a good portion, try the egg on top for something differentBonus: They got an awesome beer selection here.

We were extremely impressed with the beer menu! For the six of us we ordered the following things: Chef's Selection Oysters: I did not eat these, so cannot give a good opinion. However, those that liked oysters seemed to enjoy them. Tasting of hams: 5/5 -- This was very good and more than enough ham for all 6 of us to share. When we asked for more bread, it was promptly delivered. Mussels: 4/5 -- Very large serving in the full size order. The bread came out piping hot and the mussels were tender and juicy. The broth could have used more flavor also, with a lot of flavor this dish was hard to share and still get broth along with your serving. Scallops: 3/5 -- Though it does not say on the menu, these are bay scallops and have a nice sweet flavor. Overall, the accompaniments with the scallops made the dish extremely sweet. Veggies (Cauliflower Gratin, Brussels Sprouts, Beets): 5/5 -- For me, these were the star of the show. All of the sides had great flavor and were prepared perfectly, not mushy or too crisp. The brussels sprouts had a great spicy/sweet sauce to offset the bitterness of the sprout. The cauliflower gratin was perfect -- definitely get that one!Farm Chicken: 4/5 -- After reading others reviews of this, I was expecting the best chicken of my life; while it was juicy and very flavorful, it wasn't anything to be blown away by. I would definitely compare it to brick chicken at Rosebud. Ham in Hay: 4/5 -- The ham was delicious, flavorful without being overly fatty. I did find the \"hay\" of artichokes and carrots a bit strange. Country Rib: 3/5 -- For being family style this one was tough to share as so much of it had strangely shaped bone pieces. However, the marinade was delicious! This may be an entree only 1 or 2 people can share. Dessert (Pear Tart, Profiteroles, Cheese Platter): 3/5 -- I doubt most people are coming here for dessert, but none of this was very impressive. Next time, I would even consider just going to a new stop for dessert. Overall, the food was above average but there is nothing I would definitely return to eat again other than the cauliflower. The timing of the dishes was very frustrating, as we were served everything besides the entrees in less than 45 minutes. Even the veggie sides were served before the entrees.

Perhaps my meal at Girl and the Goat clouded my judgement of these dishes. Next came the pig eat salad which was some romaine with deep fried pig ear. It was tasty but again nothing special. Then the short ribs appeared which was basically a very fatty piece of Korean kalbi. Not good at all. We felt quite disappointed after this fish considering all the great reviews. We perhaps should have came here for brunch instead! But then the French fries and suckling pig came to rescue the meal a bit.

Little did I know in the midst of all that defines this eclectic mix of culinary diversity, a place called The Publican would be the place that stood out the most. It was also the best brunch I've ever had, and I have had many.I had heard about this place via Travel Channel shows an seen how they roll; I wanted to roll with them, so I booked a Sunday brunch for me and the wife. We started this amazing meal with an order of their Publican pork rinds. Now these aren't any Goya, out of the bag chicharones, oh no. These are made fresh to order, and dusted with a spicy cheddar seasoning. So crispy, so warm, so cheesy and spicy I couldn't help but devour them rapidly.For the main course, I got, are you ready for it: a breakfast sausage corn dog dipped in waffle batter. Not only was it a gargantuan sausage nestled under a golden brown crispy shell of batter, it was ridiculously scrumptious. Apparently it was served with grilled peaches and fresh whipped cream, but I was so enamored with the sausage that they merely served as color to make the plate more pretty. As amazing as my dish was, my wife got the plate of the day: a beautifully cooked sirloin steak with polenta served with some of the pan drippings. I felt a little bad for her getting that because I just couldn't stop stealing from her! Steak was juicy, tender, an the perfect balance of char and fattiness.Last but not least, we ordered some Publican maple bacon; simply put, the best fall apart tender thick cut bacon I've ever had. Ever. As full as I was by the time it came I felt it was my duty to finish every bite.Service was prompt, efficient, and friendly, and the ambiance feels upscale yet humble all at once.

Of all the items the chicken was the most memorable. I don't know what they did to that roast chicken, but it was the most tender/tasty chicken I have ever consumed.

I am a low end Blue Ribbon guy, but if craft beer is your thing you are all set at this place.When I am in Chicago next time, the only thing that would make another trip to the Publican better would be a larger group.

The staff was very friendly and helpful and we had a reservation which they seated us at as soon as we arrived. Nothing worse than having reservations and being curbed for 10 mins while a place gets stuff sorted out....but I digress.For a starter we sampled the coffee cake and it was fresh, warm and out of this world delicious. I'd probably have eaten 4 of those just by myself if I cast all shame and self control to the wind. But I held fast and waited for the main course I ordered. For the main course I had the wine poached eggs and while I have always been a fan of poached eggs the wine poached variety are extra delicious. It's a red wine so it will add a little bitter to the dish but since it's basically a brunch menu item it's just what your taste buds need to get the day kick started. I also ordered a side of the maple glazed half inch cut bacon and while there were only two slices it was more than filling and complimentary to the meal in general. Since the food is at a bit of a premium on price I'd recommend trying this place out at least once and if you ever have people in visiting from out of town it'd be a good spot to take them.", "Date": "2013-09-23", "Author_Location": "Raleigh, NC"}, {"Author": "Rafael R.", "ReviewID": "GKSOwfcQOIsSfcjZI1ZETA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We gorged, heavily.Not having reservations on a Tuesday night, we wandered in at 8:00 pm to find the restaurant fully packed with hungry diners. \u00a0We were led to the center of the restaurant which served as a watering hole until our table was ready. \u00a0For a short period of time, we shared our bar table with another group, who offered up their pork rinds for a taste. \u00a0While nice, they were not exceptional, the flavoring had a hint of Cheetos dust, which I thought odd, since the party offering the rinds felt that they were the best thing ever.

My first impression was positive, but probably not the right choice for our business talk. There is some private-ish table seating, but we happened to sit at a long table shared with other diners. In the middle of the room, there were interesting high tables around which people stood, drinking and sharing small plates. The music was loud and the conversations made for a real din. But I'm not complaining. That's what they're going for at The Publican: lively and informal.The food at The Publican is served family style, meant to be shared. The dinner menu has an interesting structure. It's divided into fish, meat, and vegetable dishes. As you go down the fish and meat columns, the prices get higher as the portion sizes get larger. Toward the top of each column are their small dishes, and it goes on down to entree-sized selections. The folks at my table shared mussels, oysters, and several other meat dishes, and there were a lot of happy faces as they sampled each dish. Here's the rub, though: I'm a vegetarian! Even many of the vegetable dishes have meat based ingredients here, including the frites (fried in animal fat). I resigned myself to chomping on whatever vegetables happened to come to the table.So, imagine my awe when someone told our server that there was a vegetarian at the table. She immediately asked who it was, and told me that they have a special plate they make just for the vegetarians who come in. It was wonderful! On the plate was an assortment of several different vegetable dishes. Cauliflower, asparagus, broccoli rabe, snow peas, greens and summer squash, each prepared deliciously and most definitely not as an afterthought. The preparations were innovative enough to be exciting, which is saying a lot for a group of vegetable dishes. The recipes included such yummy things as blueberries and currants, and they were perfectly seasoned. I shared with the table and everyone loved them. \u00a0Service was attentive and pleasant; the wine and beer selection seemed good, but not being much of a drinker, I'll have to leave that detail to other reviewers.So, if you're a meat eater and want great food in a social atmosphere, this is your place.

This classic dish was absolutely stunning and had a different approach with cooking the egg. The egg was crispy outside and soft inside with runny yolks. It was perfect.

I def like this a lot better than the first.Alpha King Pale Ale $5~ Three Floyds BrewingCo., Indiana, 6.00%~ The pale ale have a rather deep amber color w/ a very creamy head to it and it has a citrus aroma and hoppy finish.~ This is definitely my kind of beer and my fave out of the 3 we ordered. \u00a0Beets $11~ burrata, arugula, walnut, saba~ I just love the creaminess of burrata and nothing better than having it together with one of my favorite veggies, beet. Charcuterie Plate $15 (half)~ Every time I see Charcuterie on the menu, I will ask if it's made in house and theirs was made at their Butcher Shop Publican Quality Meat just across the street.~ I am sold right away and I was definitely not disappointed since we loved every elements here... from the meat and pate to the pickles and mustard. Sort of like the crisp younger pickles, less overwhelming and wouldn't take over the flavor of the other food.Pork Belly $24~ grits, radish & asparagus~ Just look at this huge block of melt in your mouth fatty goodness that's packed with flavors.~ The grits was creamy and light which balance out the pork belly, also love how they shaved the asparagus on top which looks really pretty. Honeycomb Tripe $8~ This was so soft and packed with flavors, dip your bread in the sauce and clean the plate good.~ I couldn't find this on their online menu so maybe this was a specialBlood Sausage $18~ It hit the spot once again, perfect texture and casing with the perfect roasted cauliflowers. Just like the charcuterie plate, the sausage was mad by their butcher shop. ~ Love the sprinkles of pistachio which is a must to give some sort of contrast in texture to the soft blood sausage.Squash Cake $18~ bosc pears, maple-sherry syrup, pear butter, pepitas & ricotta ice cream~ \u00a0Love the how the squash cake was served warm and that was probably the smoothest ricotta ice cream I ever had... the pear butter was different.

I know that everyone orders the charcuterie or oysters but we weren't feeling like either (or rather, my sister wanted the charcuterie and I was not feeling like eating a plate of ham and cheese for dinner). We settled on the porchetta with a side of roasted cauliflower and my sister ordered a St Feiullien Belgian ale.The porchetta. WOW. As the star of the meal, it did not disappoint. Fatty, savory, delicious goodness on a plate, it also came with a smattering of beans that seemed unusual at first but over time revealed itself as a perfect accompaniment to the richness of the meat. The size was just substantial enough to feed two of us when paired with the small skillet of roasted cauliflower. The roasted cauliflower was so amazing I ended up going home to look up how to roast my own and do up a little dish myself. I think it might have been the amazing tapenade/olives that came with it, but it was rockstar-status.My sister said her beer was the best beer she'd ever had, so there's that, too.Ultimately, we left happy and full and with plenty of time to spare for our show, which ended up being just as, if not more, excellent than the lovely meal at Publican.", "Date": "2013-08-15", "Author_Location": "Chapel Hill, NC"}, {"Author": "Vanessa C.", "ReviewID": "lVRG285eqBB8cZytkiqN7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As brunch lovers, we were excited to check out the Publican.

I should've tried visiting earlier then...). We decided to go family style and not order too many dishes since we already gorged ourselves once with post-race snacks. We ordered three dishes: maple ham french toast and peaches, blood sausage with shishito peppers, and a third dish I cannot remember. Each dish was unique, beautifully presented, and tasted delightful. We also got two side orders -- frites with a fried egg that was gooey and super tasty (who knew that oozy egg can transform ordinary fries into something amazing?) and maple syrup braised bacon which is to delicious to even know how to describe it. They also gave us a donut on the house which we split five ways, and that was a great way to end a fabulous meal.Everything, from the service to the decor (I love the paintings of the enormous pigs on the walls) was impeccable.

It seems like it would be much less awkward to place the standing areas towards the exterior of the restaurant... or maybe just have a seated / bar waiting area, but hey, maybe that's just me. Maybe other people actually prefer standing in the center of a large crowd of seated people. Who knows.To follow up the awkward wait, I was fully ready to dive into some outstanding food (I'd had enough 'standing' already, ha ha haaa...), but, this is where the Publican fell short in terms of my expectations. They were out of the bone marrow hash at this point, so that was disappointing, instead I opted for the pork schnitzel with peas. It was good, crispy, fairly tender - just not any different from any other schnitzel I've ever had.

All I am complaining about is the hype and the price you have to pay for it.As for food, my favorite was the roasted chicken. Gosh, that was the best chicken I've ever had in my life. For real. The ribs was not special to me. Drinks are hit or miss - since they are so specific. I ordered something under the Bitters category that tasted like bitter Chinese herbal medicine. Sigh. The Lemoncello dessert drink was great too. But then, cheese options were in the dessert menu, after I stuffed myself. Really?

When we got there the restaurant was only about half full, which caused me to be a little annoyed when the hostess sat a group of three rightnexttous at a long communal table. I mean, I'm OK with sharing my space, but it felt really awkward to be at an empty 10-foot long table with no one but the five of us crammed in a corner. Our waitress was awkward. I have no other way to describe her other than that. And we were in the corner that had a door open to the street, which provided a nice breeze, but workers from the kitchen kept bumping into my purse as they travelled out the door and across the street.For two of us, we had the Little Gem salad, then a pasta with crab, the turnips and suckling pig. The salad was one of the best I've had. We loved it and will definitely get it again - nice greens with pieces of pig's ear. I probably could've had that just to myself and been happy. The pasta dish was good. The crab flavor was subtle and it had some crunchy, buttery bread crumbs mixed in. The pasta felt a little tough though and detracted from the rest of the ingredients. We didn't care for the turnips. They weren't well-seasoned and seemed undercooked. They came to our table alone (the food comes out as it's ready), so we were stuck with those by themselves for a while. We didn't finish it. Then came the suckling pig, which was fabulous. Probably some of the tastiest, juiciest pork I've had. I only wish there had been more of it. For dessert we had the caramel pound cake that came with a marigold ice cream (I couldn't identify that flavor) and blackberries. It was really tasty but not very caramel-y.Hubs said he had two beers he liked that he'd never heard of, so that was a win in his book.All in all, our tab was about $110, which was a decent price for the meal.

It's a lot to take in when you first walk in: The booths all along the exterior are enclosed with stable-like doors; the tables in the interior are long and communal; and the central area of the restaurant is dedicated to standing bar-like tables. My party of nine was seated at a long, communal table, which made it difficult to speak to the people at each end - not just because they were far away but also because I was too busy trying to eavesdrop on the conversation of the strangers next to me.I was a little late, so I'm not sure how the initial contact with the waitress was, but she was not friendly during the time I was at the table. My friend asked for a recommendation for a side and the waitress looked at her like, \"Seriously? Are you incapable of choosing your own food?\" and said something along those same lines but slightly friendlier. Maybe it was just a bad day.I do love that their menu is totally innovative and changes frequently, and I was very excited about my summer squash fruttata (I think - it was a weird last word, definitely wasn't frittata). It ended up being a large piece of sourdough bread with squash, a scrambled egg, and lightly saut\u00e9ed spinach.

The six of us each ordered a small plate and a more shareable plate and passed them around, so we got just about half the menu. Stand outs: were the amazing fresh oysters -- great selection; the beef tongue was so flavorful and tender; the suckling pig just fell apart; and the mussels were some of the best I ever had.Honestly, if you don't like the food at Publican, you don't like food.

Arrrghh. For starters, don't confuse this Publican with Publican Quality Meats which sits directly across the street. Got it? Let's move on. This place is quite loud. The seating is communal or barracks style unless you sit against the wall which is made out to resemble a pen. Your table is literally closed off as if you were in a barn. Okay. That's very cool and hip. Wow. Let's get to the drinks. I ordered a Harp. Didn't have it. I ordered an Amstel Light. Didn't have it. At that point I figured out that basically all of the beers on the menu were German or micro brews. Fine. The waiter suggested some kind of a beer and returned with it. I was happy. It was quite good. Nice job waiter.Food. If you like fish or pork then this is your place. The food is served family style (not a fan of this) but the waiter made suggestions regarding the quantity of meals and/or appetizers. Ordered was red snapper, suckling pig, schnitzel, sweet bread, etc. The food was nothing special. The tastiest thing I consumed was the schnitzel. That's not saying much as there was more breading than meat. The portions were very small. I left hungry. Others in my party left hungry.The Publican seems to be going for a German theme. If that's the case then they should employ attractive women in short dresses and men playing tubas. Here the runners wear oil change attire. I guess that makes it trendy as well.This area of Chicago boasts many, many quality up scale restaurants. Don't believe the hype.

Clever and interesting, but not exactly convenient or safe to have stall-like doors opening outward into a heavy traffic area. Its very rustic inside, with tons of globe lights hanging from the ceiling that give a diffuse glow to the whole place.Our server was witty, friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu. He made some fantastic suggestions for adult beverages for our group and was full of hilarious and informational trivia the whole night. The menu is designed for sharing (what isn't these days?) and our server recommended 1 large dish and 1 small dish per person. This was too much food. I would say 3 dishes for every 2 people, unless you have some starvational strapping young men in your party. My BF acts as my personal garbage disposal when eating out and we still didn't finish everything in our group of 4.The food itself was generally quite delicious. There were a few misses, but when ordering 8 dishes, I didn't expect all to blow my mind. Of the below dishes, I would definitely order the fish stew again.Spanish fish stew - yum yum yum! This is more of a soup consistency with a tomato base filled with clams and mussels (served in the shell). The garlic bread served with it was also to die for - savory and crunchy and perfect dipped in the brothScallops - these were cooked well but I wasn't impressed with the sides. The brussel sprouts, parsnip puree, and grapefruit didn't come together and felt separatePotted rillettes (recommended by the server) - this was one of the more middling dishes. The meat was too chunky to be spread on the crackers, although it was delicious, especially with the sweetness of the cherriesFarm chicken - tasty (your standard roasted chicken) but served with superb french fries which tasted even better after soaking in the chicken juicePorchetta - my least favorite dish of the evening. Was oily, greasy and an overwhelming amount of meat compared to the sidesBeets - simple beet and goat cheese combo. large portionBrussel sprouts - served shredded as a salad. These were delicious. Although the puffed wild rice looked like inchworms to me, so I just couldn't bring myself to eat them.I'm missing one dish, but it must have not been very memorable if I forgot.Overall, this came out to around $100 per couple (including drinks) which is totally reasonable for the amount of food we were served.

Mentally, I harpooned that child from across the table while ravens pecked out their parents' eyes. The punishment fits the crime. Beyond all that, Publican outdid themselves on almost every level with my threesome of ladies. Among my favorite points was that of price- for the three of us with mulitple courses, drinks, dessert and dessert drinks, we each only forked out $33, including a 25% tip and we all left buckling under our belt buckles. Amen to a girls night so affordable we were able to head out for late night drinks afterwards. As far as foodies, the beet salad was A-OK, certainly not the best around town- not even top 10, but it was as I said, A to the O to the K. The pickles and pickled things were also just fine, not the best I've had, but done well none the less. The Summer squash salad and cauldron of fish stew were both fantastic and generously portioned. The salad was delightful and refreshing the stew was a cornucopia of the sea, sans filler ingredients. Since we'd filled up on craft beer before and during dinner, we decided to settle our dessert, a rich and delectable espresso cake, with some hot coffee and tea. Normally I'm all about the coffee, but when I saw Samurai Chai, I knew I had to put my kung fu hustle down on those herbs. In the end, I think the tea I got was un-steepable because it poured clear even after 10+ minutes of waiting. So, not the Bruce Lee of tea, but still a fine ending to a delightful meal.

We were both very impressed with their beer and wine selections and our waitress was incredibly helpful with making choices. Their oyster list is also impressive... I was able to select all west coast oysters, which are my favorite. The way they were shucked was a little iffy though, I ended up spitting back a lot of shell. My boyfriend and I shared the serrano ham, the boudin blanc, and the brussels sprouts. The serrano ham was different from how I'd eaten it before, but still delicious. The boudin blanc, though, was absolutely amazing. Some of the best sausage I've eaten in the city. The brussels sprouts were very different from how I thought they'd be... Very finely sliced and almost similar to a \"dry\" coleslaw. While the taste was great, it wasn't very crispy which was kind of a disappointment.Dessert was fabulous... We had the cheesecake and I absolutely loved it. To be honest, this place reminds me a lot of Longman & Eagle.

We made up our minds when I stumbled upon The Publican's NYE menu, which was one of the most reasonably priced dinners (for the quality) that I could find. I called and easily set a reservation for 10 p.m. About a week later, I called to add two friends to our reservation. The hostess informed me that we might have to wait beyond our reservation time to be seated, which I appreciated and accepted. The menu consisted of four courses:1) Salad -- Chocolate persimmons, pomegranate, pistachios, chicories, queso de valdon; 2) Pasta -- Black trumpet mushrooms, whole wheat tagliolini, trout roe, dill, buttercream curd; 3) Meat -- PQM prime rib, Yorkshire pudding, roasted potatoes, glazed carrots; and 4) Sweet -- Pecan bread pudding, bourbon, chicory caramel, creme fraiche ice cream. I cannot say enough about our dinner. Everything was delicious. My boyfriend thought the dessert was a tad on the salty side, but that was the only complaint from the table. I've been to The Publican on four other occasions -- twice for brunch and twice for dinner -- and I enjoyed each trip. One of my favorite dishes at restaurant is the waffle, which is served either as a brunch item or for dessert. It is truly the best waffle I have ever had in my life, and I now measure all other waffles against it. The beer menu is outstanding, though a little pricey.

In this case, however, I was extremely underwhelmed.And one thing that made it worse was the inconsistency. We started off with a shared plate of Frites with Fried Eggs, with near perfect frites that had be thinking, boy, is this going to be a great meal or what? And then ...Well, I ordered a waffle with jam and butter and a side of maple syrup-braised bacon, while my wife ordered asparagus omelette. Though the bacon was good -- thick and fatty and flavorful -- the waffle was about the least appetizing waffle I've ever had in a restaurant. There was nothing to it. I had no sense of the ingredients, no taste at all -- it was an un-waffle -- and was nothing more than a delivery system for toppings, because it had no flavor of its own. (Cue Peggy Lee singing, \"Is that all there is?\" Because that's what I was thinking)And my wife's omelette -- wasn't even an omelette! It was a solid mass of scrambled eggs, with some asparagus draped over it and on the side. No fillings whatsoever, just egg through and through -- which is NOT an omelette. My wife kept cutting into the egg looking for asparagus and other fillings, just like the apocryphal little boy sifting through -- well, you know what he was sifting through -- for a pony. But she was more than disappointed. She was disgusted. And the toast was was so dry as to be almost Melba toast, without even the flavor of Melba toast. I filched a slice from her, and one bite was enough. Which for me, says a lot.After hearing for so long how wonderful Publican was, this was heartbreaking.

Except when all was said and done it wasn't that great. The menu for the night was no longer really accurate as several of the best sounding dishes had been 86'd.

It doesn't matter, just get this dish. Imagine confit pork and duck leg cooked together into a heavenly meat spread, and mixed with apricots. Put this on crusty country bread. We all agreed this was the best dish of the night.Frites: I don't really like fries-- people usually give me a hard time for this, but the real problem is that most fries don't taste like the ones at Publican. These were flavorful, crispy, piping hot, and just amazing dipped in the accompanying mayo sauce. We were sad when our server took away our cone of frites-- I think we still had like 2 left...Hallibut with wild mushrooms and caviar: Have you ever had caviar that tastes like maple syrup? I love food that makes your tastebuds go \"wait, what?\" in a good way. We learned from our very knowledgeable foodie server that the way the caviar is brined determines a lot of its flavor profile-- salty, sweet, etc. The sweet caviar made this fish dish really interesting. Everything worked together-- maybe not perfectly, but it was certainly memorable.Greens with grits: I'm not a huge fan of grits normally-- even when I had it in the south, the grits were a bit too dry for me. However, I really liked the greens with grits here. Lots of flavor, but wasn't too salty, and the grits picked up a lot of the juice coming out of the veggies. I think this was notable for me mainly because I finally enjoyed grits in a dish.Taste of 3 hams and goat butter: My friends all know I'm nuts about butter, so it's no surprise I loved the goat cheese butter here, which was like really, really light, really soft goat cheese. I enjoyed the hams despite having just returned from Italy and having enough cured meat to last me a lifetime. The quality of the ham was top notch, especially the serrano.We also had the:- \u00a0Pork rinds: Really delicious and satisfying spicy flavor, kind of like nacho cheese doritos but much better. Some people may not like nacho cheese doritos, but I for one, do.- Suckling pig: From what I remember, 3 cuts combined. There were pulled-pork like bits, pork belly, and a combination of the two. \u00a0Loved the crispiness of pork belly parts, and the bits of fat in the meat were quite delicious. However, this dish wasn't a standout for us because we thought it was still slightly on the dry side.- Polish sausage: My friends loved this dish, but I thought it was a bit dry. Has some spice to it. I really enjoyed the root vegetables + olives that came with it on the side-- really nice combo.Between 6 of us, we ordered 8 dishes, which was really more than enough. We also ordered the mussels, but our server forgot to put them in. We didn't mind in the end, because we were so stuffed! Publican deserves a 5 in my opinion because 1) the food has a touch of something special, and attention is paid to small details; 2) we learned something cool from our server, who was a delight; and 3) the prices are reasonable.

\u00a0We're confused, but not upset, and let it slide. \u00a0Then a big group sits to our right, leaving two chairs empty between us and them. \u00a0And a couple sits directly next to us, leaving the entire empty half table on their other side. \u00a0And we eat for maybe an hour, and eventually one of the chairs on our right gets filled. \u00a0So... that was weird. \u00a0The seats are too close to each other, and this wouldn't be an issue if there weren't SO MANY EMPTY SEATS on either side of us. \u00a0Instead the six of us are all trying not to bump elbows and plates and the aggressively efficient water-fillers (take a sip, count to ten, I bet that water glass is full again) while there's SO MUCH SPACE next to us. \u00a0Part of the joy of communal seating is that bustling feeling, but oh my goodness there's no need if there's no need.Puzzle B: separate tabs. \u00a0During said wait we stood at the cocktail/bar area and had some beer and the taste of three hams (so good). \u00a0The hostess approached us and told us to settle our tab, then she'd show us our table. \u00a0We did so, but with much confusion. \u00a0This is literally the same room, right? \u00a0We're moving seven feet away. \u00a0Other places transfer tabs... right? \u00a0Am I crazy? \u00a0What's going on here? \u00a0Why are there giant paintings of pigs on the walls? \u00a0Actually those are awesome.Puzzle C: mysterious illness. \u00a0After eating some of the veal tartare, boy's stomach took a nose dive. \u00a0I ended up putting him in a cab and meeting him at home, where he proceeded to lie down for a few hours and drink some ginger tea. \u00a0I was fine though.Puzzle D: area. \u00a0That's fine though, and part of the charm. \u00a0No need to walk alone around here at night.Great things: smoked char with poached egg, frisee, beets. \u00a0Absolutely spectacular dish; like watching fireworks (super loud, smoky, awesome ones). \u00a0You can't really tell if you like it, but you're definitely enjoying it. \u00a0 \u00a0Taste of three hams with goat butter and peasant bread: razor thin slices of three kinds of ham, lots of fatty savoriness, some sweetness, the butter was like cheese. \u00a0So good. \u00a0Beer list: unusual, fascinating, and full of fun. \u00a0Loved our beers and our server at the cocktail area.Good things: sunchokes and turnips: blackened and sweet, which is great, with pistachios and figs, awesome, and some orange slices. \u00a0Flip back to the puzzles. \u00a0This was confusing. \u00a0But good!Squash and marinated kale: spicy, roasty, fall-y, delicious. \u00a0A very solid dish.Service: extremely prompt, perhaps too much so (the water thing was a little too fast). \u00a0Loved getting the new small plates with each course. \u00a0Very friendlySo overall, food was quite good, but our experience was a bit lacking given the price point. \u00a0Boy wants to go back for a nice meal sometime, and I'm game to try again, especially since I wasn't the one to get sick from it. \u00a0Maybe next time the seating won't be quite so confusing.", "Date": "2012-11-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Niko X.", "ReviewID": "xVt1f8zNLmzG9olkaxLtQw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dined here solo back in July while on a business trip. \u00a0Walking the meatpacking neighborhood alone trying to find the Publican makes you feel like you're in a horror film walking in a deserted warehouse district, expecting at any moment to see a meat cleaver wielding murderous maniac in a white butcher suit covered in steers' blood chasing you down. \u00a0OK that's perhaps a bit over the top... but trust me it's not that much of a stretch. \u00a0The above point aside, don't come here alone and expect to feel satisfied you tried enough, unless you plan on gorging yourself as I did. \u00a0Everything on the menu appears at first glance to be a must-try. \u00a0Some highlights: \u00a0pork rinds, duck and foie gras terrine, and Basque fish stew. \u00a0I didn't have anything I didn't like. \u00a0I'd love to go back with a small group and enjoy the communal seating and ability to order like 3x what I was able to eat without wasting food!", "Date": "2013-03-07", "Author_Location": "Orange County, CA"}, {"Author": "Cassie D.", "ReviewID": "Ci7v8qZ8Xz2cTtnUiy9osg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the scene of my first sweetbreads.

The waiter didn't blink an eye when I said I was vegetarian. I proceeded to order the spaghetti squash gratin and the broccoli dish. I loved that later he came back to check if I was okay with fish broth in the broccoli (I was, but I know most vegetarians aren't).The gratin was lovely--creamy, rich, and with a delectable breadcrumb topping, though a bit saltier than what would've been ideal. Loved the tomato and greens it included. The broccoli was the real standout: It was sort of a veggie tempura made with broccoli and lemon slices, but unexpectedly packed with flavor, and amazing paired with the included mayo dip. The broccoli was perfectly cooked and almost had its own creaminess. Both dishes seemed well worth the $10.My partner enjoyed his pork rinds and blood sausage. We also shared the cider flight, which was very interesting, but I wouldn't want to have any of them again. Two of the ciders actually had a sort of gamey aftertaste and the scent of miso soup, which is not what I'm ever looking for in a beverage.I'm generally not a fan of communal tables, but I it worked well here. It was nice to chat with the friendly peeps next to us about what we ordered. The ambiance of the restaurant was really neat with high ceilings accented with a grid of globe-shaped lamps.

We seemed to have made some good choices though because we had just enough food.All of the dishes were good and well-balanced, with the exception of the lamb sausage which was too salty even when paired with the other offerings on the plate.

The chicken was so moist and flavorful with just a little bit of crispy skin. Don't lie, you love the crispy chicken skin.

All of these dishes were well-proportioned and the relatively unusual ingredients for your typical brunch were impressively harmonious in each plate.The Publican maple-syrup-braised bacon deserves its own separate ode - savory, salty, fatty and crispy pork belly is always good, but the quality of the meat (and maybe the braising in maple syrup) made it something extra special. Hash browns were pretty standard. I liked that they had some exclusive options from \u00a0Rare Tea Cellars and I tried the Pue-rh, which was awesome.

According to Facebook, Ryan's birthday isn't until February, but I didn't want to hurt Brett's feelings, so I decided to run with it.

This worked perfectly because I was about 2 feet and 140 degrees away from Erin P., who likes to trade food. Oh wait, did I say perfectly? I meant offally (never gets old). Over the course of dinner, we traded some of our fried-egg-topped french fries and pork rinds for pig ear, tripe, and chicken. Nikki and I also romantically shared large plates of sweetbreads and country ribs, some of which we traded for a bite of sorbet. I think we all came out ahead from the barter system. \u00a0Almost everything was excellent. The pork rinds were unremarkable and I'm sorry, but I just can't get down with tripe, no matter where I'm dining. Anything that looks like a honeycomb, chews like an octopus, tastes like beans, and is a cow's reticulum is just kind of unappetizing to me. The sweetbreads and ribs, however, are must-orders. The fries are amazing too. I think they're cooked in baby dolphin fat or something. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for slightly adventurous meat eaters. I can't speak to the fish or veggies, since those seem kind of pointless when you can just eat meat, right?I apologize for all the name dropping in this review.

And last week, I got porked. Hard.Oh, Publican. I've been longing to experience you for so long, and I didn't even know what you had in store.This place was all the rage on Yelp and beyond, so it mattered not what was on the menu -- I had to try it.But I couldn't afford it myself, so naturally I had to wait until a date suggested we try it. Glorious, that worked out for me. (God, I really AM a food whore.)When I found out the menu featured beer, shellfish and pork, I was actually a little nervous. Three things I know next to nothing about and rarely seek out on my own. But I went with a capable companion who was practically a pro.We skipped the oysters and seafood entirely, so we could focus on the main event: oink, oink, oink.(Note: If you're vegan, what the HELL are you doing within five blocks of Publican? Get a clue and go to Handlebar or something.)We had the \"pickles,\" which date liked best but I found a bit revolting, a platter of three different hams, a pork shoulder and chorizo stew, sauteed ramps with mint and walnuts, and a beet salad that was beets and aioli. Andthatsit.From the crusty bread and fabulous butter that started the meal to the last bite of beet, the food was nice, with great flavor. (Another note: If you don't like salt, run away. Now. I'd personally eaten a Lean Cuisine at lunch and was just getting started with my sodium intake.)We also had a big bottle of beer -- inhumanly large, really; only wine should come in containers that big -- that went nicely with everything we ate. But I could have been drinking anything and thought it paired well. So.Overall, I did enjoy the Publican for the experience. The decor took barnyard chic to a new level; I found the \"booths\" along the restaurant's perimeter especially entertaining (the tops of the patrons' heads were BARELY visible over their stable-door confines). And there were paintings of abnormally large hogs adorning the walls.You can read any number of other reviews for more insight on the interior. My biggest beef (er, pork?) with the Publican: the crowd. I say this with as much love as I can muster, but the place seemed full of trend whores. And not in the charming, curious way that I am (though I may be biased). I didn't feel cool enough to be at Publican.The high-top tables, corral-style booths and long, communal tables were all filled with incredibly fashionable, incredibly loud people. They were jovial and obnoxious and, though they waved at me from down the table when we were seated, clearly did not give one shit that they made normal conversation completely impossible for the rest of us. Meaning me.As I write this review, it seems I am growing less and less excited about the Publican, so I'm going to end this on a high note. Despite the fact that I couldn't figure out which stall to use in the semicommunal bathroom area, they did have soap and hand lotion from C.O. Bigelow near the cleaning troughs. I mean sinks.Still, I went weeeeeeeeee, wee, wee-wee-wee-wee ALL the way home.", "Date": "2009-04-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Aurore L.", "ReviewID": "iYmh_pKvPuqOQ5rOXvwV2Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "What does it say about me if I tell you that the two most memorable things of my experience at The Publican were:- the bathroom soap- a Belgian waffleThat I am difficult? picky? insane? uneducated? prissy?

The meats are freshest and the quality is fantastic. The place was rather dim and this place wasn't considered a romantic place, just a place to indulge your red-meat fetish. \u00a0The seating was interesting -- there were large communal tables, which were cool, the booths had \"doors\" to it and the wait staff looked like they were wearing car mechanic uniforms. That Saturday was a pretty darn hot and humid day with highs in the high-90s in Chi-City. When we got there, the AC barely felt it was on. The waitress said it was due to how many people were there earlier and that the AC probably couldn't \"keep up\". By the time we got there, it was around 9PM. \u00a0We were seated in one of their booths, which had little doors to fence us in.... like cattle. The prices were rather steep and averaged about $15 a plate and is meant to be served family style. the plates were enough for four people to \"sample\" off of, so if you think you'll be getting \"seconds\" on a particular dish, you may want to order two plates of it. We ordered 6-entrees and a desert and we left there full, and less in our pocket: the total cost came out to be around $250.If you have to order something, that my friend, are the fried clams. They were AWESOME and the raw oysters we ordered were absolutely terrific. BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathrooms are located near the entrance. There were 3 women and 2 mens private bathrooms. Upon entering the bathroom, you can lock the door behind you. I think this bathroom was bigger than my closets. It had a toilet AND a urinal. The red wallpaper reminded me of a hotel and the piping and knobs had gold accents. This was a setup where the communal unisex sinks where located OUTSIDE of the stall to wash your hands. So you need to unlock the door with your dirty, fecal, urine residue hands along with the 50-people who have used the bathroom before you at some point in time during the night, \u00a0to get out..... then you go wash your hands with soap and water. They had 2 Dyson airblade hand dryers and some lotion which was nice. The interesting thing was that there were no mirrors, at least for the Men's bathroom.

They're considered aphrodisiacs because they provide your date an analogue by which to gauge your enthusiasm for other salty slimy raw things you'll put in your mouth.

\u00a0And how can you fail to make more? \u00a0It's not like the armored iced tea truck comes around only at 4am the first Tuesday after a full moon. \u00a0I don't care how posh or arcane your iced-tea process is, just take someone off carrot-pickling duty for a few minutes and have them make iced tea. \u00a0And if your iced-tea process IS too posh or arcane for that to work, then your pretension has exploded beyond all proportion to your restaurant concept. \u00a0It's iced fucking tea.I was annoyed by the lack of variety on the brunch menu. \u00a0I can't remember precisely, but on my last brunch visit there seemed like so many different choices. \u00a0Yesterday there were about ten, only two of them vegetarian.I was annoyed that I was never offered a beer menu. \u00a0I had to ask for one halfway through the meal. \u00a0You guys do still portray yourselves as a beer-focused restaurant, right?I was annoyed that our server took several minutes to return for my beer order, despite passing directly by the table twice during that time.I was annoyed at our server's reticent, three-word descriptions of the two beers that I asked about. \u00a0This place allegedly prides itself on putting its wait staff through the first level of the cicerone program. \u00a0So why bother if they aren't going to use that knowledge to educate their customers and, you know, TRY TO SELL SOME BEER?I was annoyed, on behalf of two other tablemates, at the lack of coffee-refill attention. \u00a0Their cups sat empty for at least ten minutes while we watched adjoining tables receive unrequested refills from a roving coffee-server. \u00a0Neither he nor our regular server ever gave a glance into my friends' empty cups, despite the hawkish attention paid to our neighbors. \u00a0My friends finally had to turn around to the server/bus station and ask a totally unrelated waiter for help.And sadly, stunningly, I was even annoyed, or disappointed really, by the food. \u00a0I enjoyed my maple-glazed pork shoulder, but the pickled cauliflower had no business in that dish. \u00a0I ate it separately, and the rest of the dish worked well, but come on. \u00a0There was a nice, mild savory polenta or grits kind of base, with sauteed spinach and the pork on top. \u00a0It all tasted great together. \u00a0But the cauliflower was a stranger in a strange land, and I was desperate for something neutral and bready to balance all that salt and sugar. \u00a0There was no toast included with my dish, though there was with the other two brunch entrees at our table. \u00a0But, as I said, I enjoyed the dish. \u00a0Not so for my wife's omelette. \u00a0I ate several bites and found it to be utterly boring. \u00a0It was a curiously smooth-surfaced cone of plain eggs with some stray broccoli on the side and a bewildering profusion of chopped, partially charred onion bits. \u00a0 To which I say \"???\" and \"Zzz.\"By my count, that is five demerits for our server, three demerits for the restaurant, and two that could go either way. \u00a0So even if you took the one bad server out of the equation, there are still substantial institutional transgressions here. \u00a0I won't speculate whether Paul Kahan has finally spread himself too thin, or whether the establishment has begun to take its patrons' rabid adoration for granted, or whether they are going through some kind of restaurant ennui. \u00a0Oh, oops, I guess that I just did. \u00a0Well, in any case, they have degraded significantly and I am taking them off my list. \u00a0I wouldn't turn down a free meal if someone offered it to me, but the Publican is too expensive and too far off my beaten path to justify spending my dollars and time there willingly.", "Date": "2012-07-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "LJ D.", "ReviewID": "p87Bgclu_gETP3mCoQTdQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We celebrated our Valentines Day on Thursday, 2/13 this year. \u00a0Although it took us 2 hours to drive in from Schaumburg, boy are we glad we finally made it. \u00a0Thank you to Anna the hostess who was able to seat us right away despite running late - thank you so much!!! \u00a0The decor I would describe as rustic, sort of the perfect template for a rustic wedding during the summer with beautiful lights and wooden tables and floors. \u00a0We started off by ordering a glass of wine Riesling (for me) and a German beer (for him). \u00a0 We asked for our complimentary bread/butter and kicked off with pork rinds for an appetizer. \u00a0The spicy pork rinds - the best I've ever had, the typical Hispanic meat markets don't have anything on these (and yes I am Hispanic :)) - dare I say a hint of lemon and what looked like maybe cheese popcorn seasoning?

It's silly. It's ridiculous. I understand the need to hate on a hyped restaurant, and I can't speak for everyone's experiences, but if you walk out of this place with anything less than a five star review- you're doing the publican wrong. Alright, that volcanic eruption of praise, why is it so good? Get ready, this is going to be a long one.I went here with my dad on my birthday, a wednesday night in December. We showed up at roughly 5:00 and the hostess sat us right away. We were informed that the dinner menu hadn't been printed yet, but they gave us their lunch menu. No big deal, we only had to wait 30 minutes for the Dinner menu, so we ordered a Chef's selection of Oysters and a couple beers.Dear god in heaven. These oysters. It was a complete tour of East Coast/West Coast oysters. We could taste the difference from each perfectly shucked shell. But oysters are delicious, you'd have to be trying to mess up oysters.The dinner menu came, freshly printed, and my father and I gave it the once over. We decided that we had to have the ham plate. Get the ham plate.Get the ham plate.Why aren't you eating the ham plate?It went from a Virginia Ham to an Iowa Ham to this Spanish Ham. The first two, unremarkable, I mean they were good but I live in the united states, I am aware of what Virginia/Iowa Ham tastes like. It tastes good. I like ham.But the third ham. The spanish ham. This ham is for real. This ham plays for keeps. This ham is the Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. I can describe the thin, fatty, salty, delicious components that make up this remarkable ham to you here. I could tell you it's the greatest piece of pig I have ever tasted in my life. I could tell you that if you were a vegan you are an idiot for missing out on this and should convert immediately.But I wont (and I already did, see what I did there?).Read the wikipedia. Google it. Bring a cup, because you're going to be salivating. No amount of text on a community review site can begin to explain how I felt while eating it.It may have been the beers, it may have been the company, but my father and I both started laughing while eating. I have never laughed BECAUSE food was so good before in my life.Up next, Muscles. This broth that was on the muscles was unreal. Outstanding. It was light, lemony, spicy, had a vegetable medley, and just absolutely floored me. It came with a baguette and my dad and I sopped it up until the bowl was clean. Exquisite. By this time, the beers, the laughs, the incredibly accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable wait staff had brought my dad and I into a pork frenzy. Everything was so delicious, we decided to give one more plate a go. I want to say it was the Pork Poulet but it's not on the menu anymore, and google seems to think a Pork Poulet doesn't exist. It was Pork three ways and it was exceptional. Stuffed! I was STUFFED! Remember that Monty Python sketch where the guy couldn't even eat a single, solitary, paper thin wafer? That's how I was feeling. How could I go on to order a dessert? However, it was my birthday, and gluttony was our friend, and so my dad and I decided a waffle was in order.This may have been the lightest, crispiest, sweetest waffle I've had in my entire life. It just straight up destroyed any waffle I've ever had. The crunch was beyond satisfying and the aroma it gave off was intoxicating (as if I wasn't intoxicated already). It was, like everything I had, prodigiously wonderful. That's right, I just thesaurus'd that word. Take that.We walked out of there dropping roughly 200 before tip. For two guys, tons of beers, and tons of good times -- only 200 bucks? We must have been taken care of, because I thought this place was supposed to be overpriced!The service was top notch. Everyone was wonderful, informative, and generally focused on making sure we had a good time. Service comparable to their quality of food. Perfect.Look, I understand why people are highly critical of this place. If you aren't into pork, fish, cheese or beer then this definitely isn't your jam. On the contrary, If you're looking for a memorable meal and want to share the wonderful experience of great food with those close to you, I cannot think of a single better place in Chicago to do it.

Entering the restaurant, it wasn't crowded yet so we were given the option of sitting either outside on the patio yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026, at the long communal tables in the center of the large dining room yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026, or in the pig pen booths along the periphery of the room yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026. Of course we went with the awesome pig pens because who wouldn't want to have our own swinging private doors enclosing our table?!? Once enclosed, the first thing we ordered were mimosas: one of each of the regular Mimosa (white wine) + the Publican Mimosa (served with beer). yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026 Delicious accompaniment to the meal, but not really worth the price tag. And as for our 5 dishes, I'm going to rank order them from the AMAZING to the very good. Because truly... for a meal like this, there was not a single bad dish that we didn't like. \u00a0 Country Ham Schnitzel yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026If you've ever had katsu before... imagine it 1000x better! The crunch of the batter coating on the outside was perfectly light + crispy while the pork on the inside melted in our mouths. The fried egg on top was a nice touch as the gooey of the egg blended with the textures. As this was actually the last dish to arrive at our table, I'm glad we had inadvertently saved the best for last. Soft Shell Crab Sandwich yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026Perfectly cooked! The whole crab was deliciously crunchy without losing the taste of the crab, itself. Slathered with a tomatoey-mayonnaisey remoulade + lettuce, the flavor almost reminded me of the pork belly sandwiches at Forage in Silverlake. The fingerling potatoes are cute touch, but I don't think we finished them all. \u00a0 Bouchot Mussels (half order) yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026Bigger portion than I expected for being a 1/2 order! The mussels were fresh + especially tasty when slurped with the some of the buttery beer garlic sauce pooled at the bottom. The roll on top wasn't memorable other than using it to soak up the last of the yummy sauce.Red Wine Poached Egg yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026This is one of the highlights according to the Yelp reviews, + we weren't disappointed! While we couldn't really taste any wine flavor to the eggs, they were cooked perfectly + oozed over the sourdough bread. The key is to get some of all the ingredients (prosciutto, arugula, egg with bearnaise sauce + sourdough) in each each bite. \u00a0Fulton Market Quad yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026Phallic innuendo with the plating much? LOL... That aside, this dish was a bit of a confusing combination of ingredients as essentially an upgrade of eggs with sausage + toast... plus a couple random little pickles. While each ingredient was delicious + cooked well, I probably wouldn't order this again since everything else had more of a cohesiveness on the plate that we enjoyed better. \u00a0And then of course, we had to go with the waiter's suggestion of a side of the famous Maple syrup Braised Publican Bacon! yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026DELICIOUS! Sliced thick, it's essentially maple pork belly with a crunch on the outer edges + soft fattyness on the inside that made this as irresistible as many of great pork belly dishes I've had back in LA. \u00a0All the dishes here were so simple in their preparation + plating that the flavors of the pork + seafood most definitely stood out as nothing other than quality ingredients. I definitely recommend coming here with a decent sized group so that you can share + enjoy multiple different dishes. The idea of the communal enjoyment of food is key here from the table arrangements to even the design of the bathrooms. \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/LMao\u2026 This was one of those meals that leaves you not wanting to eat again for the rest of the day just so you can hold on to the satisfying feeling of utter contentment with the remnants of the last bite still lingering in your mouth.", "Date": "2011-07-25", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Brad C.", "ReviewID": "vpi1DunfXqkV9oeNllg-Pg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So close.The food is there: potee luscious, mussels silky, the oysters brilliantly briny.

My friend Leigh has been just dying to try brunch at The Publican and I'm so glad we did just that. I cabbed over but from what I understand, parking isn't TOO terrible if you want to drive (but it is Chicago, so.) Also, make reservations! We saw so many people waiting forever to sit down, and they had to be hungry.I didn't know how I'd feel about the communal tables but it was actually just fine! It was kind of cool to be squeezed in there with people who love brunch just as much as I do. Coffee was poured for us right away and it was some of the best coffee I've had in a while, and bloody mary's and mimosas were next. Let me just say this: best bloody mary I've yet to try! This thing was spicy and you can tell no mixes were involved... it was well-prepared and so flavorful. Oh, and the small glass of beer you get with it wasn't so bad either! The mimosa was just fine... those are pretty standard, though.Start brunch off with a pecan sticky bun -- trust me! It's so good... although I don't know why their menu reads bun(s), plural, because it's just one bun. Either way though, yum. I ordered the quiche (escarole, onions, parmesan) and it comes with a market salad, and it was pretty good! Luckily I wasn't too hungry because the quiche wasn't too big, and while the salad was fresh, there wasn't too much there. Regardless, I did like both items very much but was jealous of Leigh's omelette with mortadella, cauliflower, gouda & aged balsamic. The roasted cauliflower combined with the cheese was dynamite! Her portion was HUGE so luckily she shared a little with me. If I go back, I'm definitely ordering that.Make reservations, make sure you have a couple hours to devote to eating and drinking, and welcome to the ideal way to spend a Sunday morning.", "Date": "2011-10-31", "Author_Location": "Saint Louis, MO"}, {"Author": "Rich C.", "ReviewID": "NLhCJUar5b44rD-ZzBYJzA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nom Nom NomIf I was the incredible Hulk, I would pick this place up and carry it back to Pittsburgh with me.Getting drunk and eating great brunch should really happen every day.

Best bloody mary I have had in a long time. The food was pretty good too but the service is a whole other story and fell beyond short in my book.I am a big fan of the communal dining setting but the inside of this restaurant takes it another step. I felt downright strange inside, as if I was a part of a wooded Alice and Wonderland Mad Hatter Party, upon gazing at the high backed numbered chairs. As I soaked it in with a drink I became more and more comfortable it but still it was too strange for me to handle in my hungover sunday state. So thankfully with the wonderful weather outside, I went back to the hostess and requested to sit outside.The first oddity of the meal began after we had ordered a round of cocktails at our bar \"table\", just like the ones they have outside at Avec, while waiting to sit down. The waitress took her sweet time bringing over the first round of drinks, but alas they were great I loved the Bloody Mary with the beer accompaniment! I had the Hitachino Nest Espresso and it was wonderful.While taking the first sip of my beer the waitress dropped the bill on the table without so much as a word to our party. Also, she neglected to bring the ice water I had asked for. You think someone would have the courtesy to ask if we liked our drinks before plunking down the bill. Alas, it is Sunday and I am very hungover so I quickly erase the it from my mind. But OH NO, this woman has the nerve to come back a few minutes later, interrupts my girlfriend while she is talking to tell me that the bill is on the table. THANKS A LOT @SSH@T, I saw it in plain view when you obnoxiously basically threw it at us the first time, I paid even though I contemplated asking to speak with the manager at this point but even more so wanted another drink considering we had to wait another 30 minutes to sit outside.At long last, after what seemed like eternity we were granted our wish to go outside. What a relief over the poorly lit, noise deafening, medieval dungeon inside. The table we were given though was strangely not clean, not only were there NO NAPKINS or silverware but two half full glasses of milk and one that had turned over on the table. WTF?!?We sat down to the table and I expected the hostess to see the mess and ask someone to clean it up but she walked away after plainly staring right at it! I had to ask a waiter to clean the table that should have already been clean, especially considering we had waited over 40 minutes to sit outside and not only that but half of the dining room was empty. After cleaning the table though, he left without putting silverware or napkins on the table...Another waiter came along and we ordered an omelet, pork confit sandwich, french toast, and fries with fried eggs. I also asked for napkins again...About 15 minutes later the squirrelly waiter comes back to tell me if forgot to tell me they are out of french toast. GREAT! So not only are they now out of french toast but he just finally managed to put the order in. This guy had the never to bluntly ask me \"whatta want instead?\"!HOW THE F$#K should I know what I want without seeing a menu genius, so I had to ask for a menu. At this point I was pissed off and just ordered the first thing I saw, \u00a0zucchini bread with pears. But wait.... there are still no napkins on the table so I have to ask again for them to be brought out.Another round of drinks comes out and finally our food about 20 minutes later. Guess what? STILL NO NAPKINS ON THE TABLE! IS ASHTON KUTCHER HIDING IN A VAN ON FULTON? AM I BEING PUNK'D?NO I WASN'T! SHAME ON YOU PUBLICAN!I calmly asked for napkins from another waiter, after giving up on the scat squirrel waiter, and finally got them.But wait!?! Looking around the table something is missing. Where is the order of fries? I ask the waiter and get an \"OOOOOO SORRY MAAAN, I FORGOT ABOUT 'EM\" I was so pissed off at this point, I was beyond words and just put my head down. Here's a tip rookie, if you can't remember 4 things that a table orders it is time to get a new F$&#ing job. I wanted to walk over to my car, get my mole skin notebook out of my car, and B*#CH slap him in the face to the ground.Overall the food was good but nothing spectacular to write home about from what I tasted, maybe dinner is better?The service really put a sour tasted in my mouth. I came here because of my personal Avec and Blackbird association with greatness and what I thought anything Paul Kahan touches but obviously Midas hasn't given his touch to Publican. I will not be returning anytime soon without some sort of \u00a0concession from the management. The service was beyond inexcusable.

I would give Publican 3.5 stars. I went on a Saturday night and I was sitting across from the guys from Anthrax, now, by looking at my photo, you may not think that would excite me, but what you don't know is that I am a self-proclaimed, rock chick from way back. Let's try to stay focused on the review.... The Room. A significant risk and I applaud the owners for taking this risk because it is an unusual lay out which I find refreshing in this sea of \"the same\". I thought the room looked like the staging for a German Opera and that at any moment, we the actors (diners in this case), would break out into drinking song. There is one giant U shaped table in the room, the seating is communal to the point that one is imprisoned in their chair. The ginormous chairs are too heavy and cumbersome to pull in and out without significantly disrupting your neighbor's experience. I do like that you can stand in the middle of the U and wait for your table, and there can be a significant wait. The bar space is awkward but I think I'd get used to it. In fact, I think next time, and there will be a next time, I will sit at the bar. The lighting was the only thing that bugged me, it is bright. I look much better in dim lighting, particularly as I age. The Beer list. Huge. I don't know much about beer, but I do know that there are plenty of 8 and 9 point beers on this menu, I need not know more. The food. I don't dine on swine - therefore, this posed a problem for me. I did have two very good salads. The fish portion of the menu is enough to keep me fed while my pig-loving friends eat 'till their hearts content. The staff. Paul the bartender, very, very friendly and helpful. Our server, a lovely girl, was great at describing the food. Only one minor flaw, when I asked about the Monk Fish Liver she had not tasted it and could not adequately describe it to me, she had to ask two people before she could deliver an acceptable answer. The beer guru they sent over to help me with the beer list, well, he was 12. I did not find him in the least bit helpful. I don't know anything about beer and I need a lot of hand holding. When I go to a restaurant and ask to speak with a sommelier, they can deal with my ignorance, this guy could not. In fact, someone mentions the Maproom in one of these reviews, I was there earlier this week and the bartender at Maproom knew her stuff exponentially better than this guy, or at least could communicate her knowledge better, perhaps Publican should recruit her? \u00a0And one last note, Donnie Madia's outfit matched the decor of the room.

Regardless how it was made, it all tasted great with different texture. It came in a big pan with lots of oil in it.

Our waitress did not explain the menu, and the complete lack of information architecture wasn't helping either (graphic design nerd comment). What she did explain was that even the fries (one of 2-3 \"vegetarian\" \u00a0items on the menu were fried in animal fat). She also suggested a $30 beer when the $12 beer I was considering was unavailable. Saddest of all- the food isn't even worth mentioning! It did nothing to help the situation. No one in my group was satisfied with what they got, and you can bet we didn't stick around for dessert.I certainly like the idea of the place, but absolutely everything fell short for me.

I dont feel like I am a picky eater until I peruse a menu like this. Tongue, quail, venison and beef heart.....not really for me. Tip number 2: The appetizers are not in their own section. For example, the header will be FISH and the appetizers are underneath and then the entrees but each are not labeled as appetizer, or entree. And the price is deceiving too. You think youre getting away with a nice entree of scallops for $15 but it's really an appetizer portion. Ask questions!The interior is nice, simple, country communal dining with a nice upscale clean look. The only problem is that it's too noisy and if youre dining next to some loud bozo who keeps pounding the table with his fists when he belts out what might be laughter all night, its a little toooo loud. They had a nice idea with the bathrooms but for women I dont think it jives well. Again, going with the communal theme, the washroon is one huge room with no door. Spaced over two walls are four bathroom stalls labeled \"men\" or \"women\" \u00a0which are complete rooms with doors that go from floor to ceiling. There is a little mirror in there if you need to fix your hair but no where to lay out any hair fixin' supplies. To wash your hands you have to go back out into the big room and use the round trough-like sink with fancy pump soaps on top. Now on to the reason we were really there int he first place - to eat! We got a nice huge bottle of belgian beer selected by our waiter. Excellent choice but dont ask me what it was. We shared a salad, which, in most places, for $7 would be enought for 2 to share - not so much here. We had the scallops for an appetixer which came with a wonderful smoked cauliflower. I need to figure out how to make that at home! The entree was the farm chicken. For the price it was worth it because this was probably the best damn chicken I have ever had. it was broiled and basted with olive oil! So much healthier than corn oil or whatever garbage they use at other restuarants. They placed the chicken atop fries - called frites when you pay a lot for them. The juices from the chicken ran into the fries and.......OMG!Overall it was good.

I have waited and waited to write this review, because I just want to get it right. I do not think I can sing the praises of this place loud and well enough. Customer Service: From the moment we walked in, the service was top notch. We were greeted by two perky hostess, one took our coats and the other checked us in with our reservation. We were escorted to our table, which we did not like. It was in the middle of one of the community tables. We asked for a more private two top over by the windows and the hostess was more then happy to move us. Once seated, we were greeted by our waiter who was a big bear type gentleman named Tim and one of the many assistant waiters who were running around. \u00a0Main waiters wore beige chef type coats and assistant waiters wore mechanic type short sleeve shirts with there names on them. As our dining experience continued, it was obvious that waiters take your orders and the assistants do everything else. Tim did bring us our bar orders, but Nick served us all our food items. Food: I love the fact that on the menu they tell which farm and where the farm is located. Not that I would know where they are, but it was still cool that they let you know. Our food was some of the best I have experienced period. We started out with a Arugula Salad. The pears were crisp and being combined with Parmesan and cashews made it so refreshing. I ordered the Country Ribs, which were more like strips of a pork steak, there were no bones. They were thick and tender. I also had the Sweet potatoes with fried Sage. These by far were the best sweet potatoes I have ever had. They were cubed and pan seared with hazelnut picada. I'd love to be able to have this every Thanksgiving instead of the typical candied you have at the holiday. My coworker order the Duck Hearts not something I would order or even try, but he liked them and I posted a picture of them so they wouldn't feel neglected. Back to Customer Service, Nick one of the assistant waiters brought us all of our food items. He was very personable and explained everything we ordered again as he placed it on the table. He made sure we had everything we needed. We shared a dessert, it was the Pecan Pie with Maple Gelato. It was not a traditional PP, the meat of the pie was more cake like. However, it was delightful. While dining I needed to get up and use the restroom, so as I always do I folded my napkin in fourths and placed it on the table. I went to the restroom, which was an entire experience within itself. Each sex had two private little rooms, that were decorated to the max. Then in the common area was a large water fountain for washing your hands and the bonus treat, \"Dyson Air-blade\" dryers. When I returned to my table, I noticed my napkin had been re-folded the correct way and placed back on the table. The correct way to fold a napkin at The Publican is in thirds so the logo shows when napkin is placed on table. A small detail that I loved and that made me smile. I know I have rambled on this review, but words just could not capture this experience. As we were leaving the hostess again were charming, and I told them I was a Yelper. They said they'd watch for my posting, hope I didn't disappoint them.Closing side note: Salt and Pepper are not on the tables and when you ask for it you may get a funny look.

We opted for the al fresco dining as though it was unusually hot and humid for May in Chicago, the outdoor area is protected from the sun. Our server Antonio took good care of us and all four us enjoyed the meal. I did peek inside and it was really modern and chic looking; the bathroom is funky and definitely worth checking out and I loved the ceilings and wallpaper. I had heard from several people that they consider Publican to offer the best brunch in Chicago; though after dining here North Pond still is number one in my book, I definitely can see how others would view Publican as tops. The menu is creative with lots of interesting and upscale options featuring seasonal cuisine. What is fun is that the Saturday and Sunday brunch menus are completely different from one another, so you can either take a peek online and choose the day that has the menu most appealing to your palate or you have a built in excuse to come here twice.Everyone at our table liked their dish of choice; my father ordered the pork schnitzel served with a waffle (and proclaimed it was the best schnitzel he had ever had), my mother and wife both selected the soft-scrambled egg focaccia and I went with the chorizo flatbread topped with a fried egg, cucumbers, mint, fresno chiles and cumin raita. You know a menu is exotic when the Yelp spellchecker is trying to inform me that five of the foods I just mentioned are misspelled (though surprisingly it did approve schnitzel). The table shared the Burton's maple syrup braised Publican bacon which consisted of two very large, thick pieces of juicy and tasty pork belly. Publican's brunch is definitely gourmet and everything is elevated from your typical bacon and eggs type fare. Portions are fairly generous and the price point is quite reasonable (most dishes run $10 to $15). Brunch at the Publican also has nice beverage options; if you are in need of some java they offer a bottomless cup or a French press (Intelligentsia has created a blend exclusively for Publican). There are fresh squeezed juices, rare teas and of course adult beverages. I had the Bloody Mary which came with a choice of a sidecar of one of three craft beers. The Bloody Mary mix is house-made as are the added celery bitters. The Bloody was nice and spicy and had an attractive appearance with lots of asparagus spears and cucumbers protruding, but I found that the pickling of these veggies did not have the most pleasant taste. There are some other fun breakfast cocktails and my wife loved the Gin and 'Treuse (featuring green chartreuse) and my mother enjoyed a Mimosa. While brunch at the Publican did not blow me away, it certainly was very good and well worth experiencing if you want to try a high quality elevated play on typical brunch. My experience was definitely positive enough that it left me craving more and I will have to make it back to Publican in the near future to try dinner; if I lived in the West Loop I would be a regular here for brunch.", "Date": "2012-05-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Caesar R.", "ReviewID": "z4ezJMgr_kyK5TRQpr-JEA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a little worried after reading the most recent reviews. \u00a0But they all seemed to complain about the service and somewhat about the food. \u00a0Well, I thought they were all a bit off. \u00a0I had a great meal last night, and living near a hipster neighborhood in Brooklyn, the service was no different than I get back home, so I was accustomed to the blaze attitude. \u00a0But it really was the food that shined as the star here. \u00a0The wife and I started with the yellow-tail crudo which was light and refreshing. \u00a0Following this was the delicious soft shell crab with a tomato cucumber salad. \u00a0Then came the fig salad with burrata, so tasty. \u00a0The dishes progressively got better, until....the Ham Chop...it was Legen....wait for it...dary! \u00a0This thing was one of the most amazing combinations of ham, sauce, peaches and pecans ever created. \u00a0The beverage program is focused heavily on beer. \u00a0I grabbed a draught selection of a summery pale ale and the wife had a belgiuan wheat. \u00a0It is definitely worth the trip for the food. \u00a0Another notable dish seen on many other tables was the chicken and fries. \u00a0Looked yummy.", "Date": "2011-07-25", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Anisha A.", "ReviewID": "-g_hW1e-dYCPCnD0rg3BOQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Went on Publican's 2nd night of business, when the kinks were in full form.They took the spirit of Avec and tried to force it in a room 4 times the size, which doesn't work too well.

I'd been being goaded and ribbed for months because I hadn't had the chance to go, and when a friend asked if I'd like to join her group for dinner last night I leapt at the chance. Here were my impressions from start to finish:1. The valet out front was jumbled with the place next door and generally disorganized.2. We were seated immediately, which was great! The bathrooms were cool and I liked the layout and design of the place.3. The busser was distracted and over-filled one of the water glasses, flooding the table and getting water all over one of my friends. There was no acknowledgement, much less an apology.4. Our server apologized; he was very knowledgeable and he seemed to actually LIKE what he was selling and gave very good descriptions of the menu items and specifically recommended the fries with the egg and the shaved truffles.5. ...which was great, because three other dishes we'd wanted were 86'd. At 9:30 on a Saturday night. 6. One of my dining companions is a self-professed wine nerd and scoffed at the organization - or lack thereof, apparently - of the wine menu. I'd kind of thought we'd be having beer, as I'd heard they have a tremendous selection and can offer good pairings, but he was the designated wine chooser and I went along. I thought the wines he chose were delicious, so they do have good wines.7. The food came and it was...odd. We'd ordered a radish dish that was essentially a mound of whipped butter with salt and a small handful of really small radishes. The oysters were delicious, I'm told, but the hamachi plate was oddly - disconcertingly - fishy.8. The fries/egg/truffles dish came and visually, it was amazing. They were VERY generous with the truffles; as they should be, as the dish goes up by $24 with their addition. We'd gotten this order specifically upon the server's recommendation, so imagine our dismay when we went to stab the yolks for dribbly golden goodness only to find that they'd overcooked them. Horribly. They were over-hard instead of a lovely, gooey sunny-side up. One of my companions suggested that maybe that was how it was supposed to be (which would not make sense, in my opinon), but when our server came we asked and he'd said the eggs were supposed to be runny and he graciously offered to send out a replacement plate, even though we'd eaten the first one because we were hungry. The replacement plate, unsurprisingly, came without the truffles, which made me chuckle. 9. The farm chicken is SO GOOD. It's moist and flavorful, if a touch heavy on the oregano. The spicy pork rinds were CRACK, I tell you. The porchetta was gorgeous, as was the pork belly. The ribeye was perfect; nice and red and juicy.10. Aforementioned busser returned to collect some plates and he misunderstood that one of my companions was asking to keep a plate that he wasn't quite finished with. So when he picked it up and walked away and my friend asked him if he'd please return the plate with the fries, the busser walked back the few steps to the table, fairly flung the dish down and HISSED at my friend, \"You don't respect me!\" This was...appalling. I was a server for 8 years; part of the job is not taking any perceived slight personally, and definitely not acting upon it and/or lashing out at a customer. The busser never returned to our table, but shot us daggers from the nearby tables - really! I saw him and looked over because another one of us at the table said he was giving us the death glare and he was!We are not problem diners, I promise. We weren't loud or fussy, we didn't require anything out of the ordinary and we were all really looking forward to this dinner. But between the busser and the bi-polar food, I'm in no hurry to return to The Publican.Edited to add: I should mention that our server gave us some after-dinner digestifs, which were delicious.

The place is loud loud LOUD and when our party of 6 stepped outside after the meal, it was the first time in 2.5 hours we could all hear each other talk. I dunno, I'd like to have conversations with the people I eat dinner with? Maybe, I'm like, too retro for this particular dining concept.Ohh, but the food--the food was fantastical, meaty pleasure after pleasure. We had the trio of hams, the sweetbreads (horrified and charmed), the short ribs, the salmon, the bourdin blanc, the fish stew, the chicken--OHHHHH--the chicken. I have to say, the bourdin blanc was hands down the best sausage I have ever put in my mouth (I know what you're thinking...) But srsly. With that spicy mustard? I could have eaten sausage after sausage after sausage. And the chicken was some of the most tender, well-seasoned poultry I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. Well done, there. So I think that if I ever do return, I'll do a couple things differently: a) Reserve a booth to hopefully intimatize (it's a word, right?) the experienceb) Ignore parts of the menu (READ: brain)c) Eat a salad beforehand so my body doesn't go into meat-induced shock.", "Date": "2009-05-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Joel M.", "ReviewID": "gNwhnjKs91RhCzWXMBMl_A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "On a normal night, two Alpha King Pale Ales, a tube of pork rinds, a plate of pickles, and a GIANT plate piled with ham (three types) would be more then enough food. \u00a0I'd probably get the meat sweats and fall asleep on the cab ride home. \u00a0This night, it was just the appetizer because I followed it up with an ENTIRE CHICKEN. \u00a0And two more Alpha Kings. \u00a0I'm not sure why my wife and I ordered so much on our first trip to the Publican, but I ended up gaining seven pounds from this meal alone.The food is good - nothing amazing but delicious, fresh, and carefully prepared. \u00a0Service was pretty solid and the atmosphere was unique and fun (think modern German farm/bar). \u00a0The beer list is great but I was expecting a little more variety on the draft list. \u00a0Overall, it's a great experience for a pretty decent price. \u00a0 But be careful with how much you order because you WILL eat everything that ends up on your table.", "Date": "2011-02-16", "Author_Location": "Indianapolis, IN"}, {"Author": "Mill V.", "ReviewID": "r4e3vzIgfWuHuZE2iPHymQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "eh.

The third time I interrupt the host and finish her sentence for her. Finally I can stand no longer, explain I have a bum knee and 2 seconds later a chair is plunked down right in front of the host station. \u00a0I can sit down but now I feel emotionally worse, like I am some crippled old lady, everyone who walks in stares at me. \u00a0No drinks are offered to those of us in line, we're just standing (or in my case sitting) and waiting.Finally they seat spouse and me and offer us drinks on the house, we thank the server for the peace offering, hoping that the best is yet to come.Room is mobbed and painfully loud. \u00a0They had not fixed the acoustics since our prior visit five months ago, though our server told us back then that they were about to add some sound-deafening materials. \u00a0We had delayed our return hoping that either Publican's popularity had waned enough to quiet the crowd, or management had invested in some fabric. Alas, still nary a tablecloth or rug or curtain in sight.Then we order. \u00a0Rillettes, salad, frites. My spouse orders pork belly for his main and I order the housemade boudin blanc for mine. \u00a0My favorite sausage from Belgium, white veal sausage similar to a veal brat but with more elegant seasoning. \u00a0We get our apps (very good) and an appropriate interval later spouse gets his pork belly......and then I wait, and wait, and wait...no boudin blanc in sight.Can't find our server, and backwaiter who had brought the porkbelly is clueless. \u00a0Finally flag down our server after 15 minutes--looked like he was responsible for about 50 tables--and he replies that the SOP at Publican is that one dish comes out at a time, and people share them, sort of like a tapas or dim sum place. \u00a0So he \"assumed\" that's the way we wanted our dinner, too. \u00a0I point out that (as we told him earlier in response to that rather annoying question asked by too many servers these days) yes we have been there before. \u00a0We know the drill, and know dishes can be served simultaneously instead of sequentially. \u00a0I remind him I said \"this is his main course, this is mine, we want them brought out together\". Oh, most likely the backwaiter was confused, breech of tradition and all that. Boudin should be up shortly.Meantime I insist that spouse eat his dinner so it won't get cold. No one has made an effort to remove his pork belly and bring him v2.0 to synchronize with MY main. \u00a0It is now 10:00pm, we arrived 7:50pm.Another 30 minutes go by, no boudin blanc. \u00a0Server apologizes, an assistant manager comes over to our table and apologizes. \u00a0He knows our res had not been honored, too, I'm dumbfounded that they would compound errors. The lame excuse for the missing sausage now is that the resto is really busy (duh) and the kitchen is backed up. I tell him that my poor little porker should have been priority given what happened. \u00a0Paul Kahan himself should have thrown the blasted sausage on a corner of the giant grill, cooked it up in 5 minutes, and served it to me.Boudin blanc finally arrives about 10:45. \u00a0I'm not really hungry any more. \u00a0Have eaten too much good bread, the apps, and 1+ orders of french fries (the first order comes out blanketed in salt). \u00a0I eat half the sausage, ask for doggy bag. \u00a0In case you're wondering, yeah, it was good, but not thaaaaat good. \u00a0Now it's 11pm, our ears are ringing, I'm tired of sitting, my knee is throbbing, we want the blazes out. \u00a0We ask our server for the check.The general manager (not the assistant) comes out and introduces herself. \u00a0Tells us the entire dinner has been comped, gives us her card, tells us to come back soon and ask for her, implication is that she'll comp us again until we are happy. \u00a0We decide to be decent and give the server a nice tip. \u00a0We agree that it wasn't (mostly) his fault, couldn't blame him for the house not honoring our res, or for the kitchen not getting its grill priorities straight, tho maybe it was his fault that the two mains didn't come out together, but more likely we think it was the backwaiter getting his signals crossed. \u00a0We tell the server to bring us a zeroed out bill so we can put a tip on it and he absolutely refuses. \u00a0Don't think it was management telling him no, but that he really didn't think he deserved anything. \u00a0So we left a $20 bill on the table, whoever got it we don't know. \u00a0Hope it wasn't the grill man.Bottom line, \u00a0the food is quite good in a rustic way (though I wouldn't recommend it to someone who keeps Kosher), but sound level is just slightly below sonic boom and res are honored about as often as a Bears quarterback. \u00a0So far, Publican't.", "Date": "2010-01-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Heather S.", "ReviewID": "ngSiVHzWOMIuht7uWeeV4w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a very memorable evening here for our 8th wedding anniversary. \u00a0Food and service were amazing. \u00a0Loved the design of the place - very conceptual and cool. \u00a0Brought back many memories of the state fair and farm. \u00a0Bar space is a bit strange in the center. \u00a0In fact, I never even had a chance to observe the copper bar. \u00a0A bit noisy though. \u00a0Loved the bathroom design and the hand soap smelled so great! \u00a0We really enjoyed trying out some new cuts of meat such as the pig ears and sweetbreads. \u00a0We definitely plan to be back to try the frites and pork rinds. \u00a0Items that stick out in my mind as exceptional were the waffle dessert w/ peaches and the daily pickles. \u00a0So yummy.", "Date": "2010-09-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Peater J.", "ReviewID": "l9wUWQ90ODCZTOK769GGlg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good, but not great. \u00a0If Yelp allowed .5 star increments, it would give this place 3.5 stars. \u00a0We arrived and we're promptly seated on busy Labor Day evening. \u00a0 Our server, did a good job explaining all of the favorites on the menu, ordered drinks, had good conversation. \u00a0 -The first dish was served, but it was intended for another table, not ours. \u00a0-The second dish, the chef's tasting of oysters, was good, but it was missing a spoon for the mingnonette. \u00a0 I would've liked another sauce option with the oysters, since I'm usually accustomed to eating my oysters with spicy sauces. -A \"small\" issue with the pork rinds.-The bread service, which I should believe should always come first, was served during the with the entrees. \u00a0-Out of the heirloom tomato salad. \u00a0This should never happen, 86 the item and give the remaining salads to a server to sell. \u00a0 Overall, just a lot of minor details were missed during the meal. \u00a0 Our server was great, but I felt like the runners and support staff needed to be on-the-ball better. \u00a0The food was good. \u00a0Very simple, but I was really expecting a lot more from this meal. \u00a0I still believe that Avec is Paul Kahan's best restaurant.", "Date": "2010-09-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Steve M.", "ReviewID": "26-vFocpZCkiNS88iZxHlQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What better way to celebrate your big 2-9 than with a pilgrimage to the swine mecca that is The Publican?

Which brings us to Crash & Burn Moment Number 1: One of the runners didn't think she was dressed appropriately for Publican's upscale ways. Luckily, her track pants and grandma sweater fit right in with the restaurant's eclectic vibe.CBM#2: Industrious 10k-ers took much longer than expected to get to the meetup point, leaving one of our party stranded solo at Publican while we hustled to make it over. During his 25 minute layover, the seating time went from \"no problem, we can seat you as soon as your party shows up\" to \"it'll be 40 minutes at least.\" Yeesh. Crisis was averted on two fronts: First, we were allowed to order a few small things off the menu to be delivered to one of the standing tables in the middle of the dining room, and second, we were seated in about 7 minutes. This led to some confusion in the delivery of our pre-ordered food but things generally worked out and only a hash brown was lost. The third (but not final) CBM came when the same stranded diner realized he needed to get a move on if he was going to make it to the airport to pick up his girlfriend on time. Our server, who appeared at first glance to be too ironic for her own good, came through with flying colors and got him his pork shoulder entree in no time, and he was out the door shortly thereafter.It helped that he just about died eating the pork shoulder. Oh, the moaning. He professed his undying love for Publican and all it's porky delights. The other dishes were also great. I loved the quiche and the hashbrowns were total perfection. The waffle was also a hit. I would seriously avoid the salad, though. The dressing was disgustingly heavy and just gross. This would have been CBM#4 but I was so happy with those hashbrowns that I barely noticed.Final CBM: Our check was a nightmare. Totally screwed up.

Awesome.We got the pork rinds, taste of three hams, grilled market greens, tomatoes, and lamb with curried yogurt/chickpeas. Obviously the menu changes often.

Even the pork. My favorite was the salmon; I have just NEVER had salmon THAT GOOD. Then the guinea hen fois gras; wow. The beers were perfectly paired as well. Dessert was perfect! If ya have the chance and the financial liberty or dare, go catch this menu! Otherwise, rest assured that practically anything you will put in your mouth on their menu is probably amazing.

They told us that they were waiting for our table to clear out, and offered to take our coats and start us with a drink at the bar. Excellent, friendly service. Everyone got something different and they came quickly and efficiently. I was an idiot and went cheap with a Gumballhead, but later went back for a kriek lambic that was out of this world. Several folks in our party also downed the French cider that was on top, which was to die for.After about 15 minutes, when it became clear that the party hogging our table was taking their good sweet time, they came over with some complimentary pork rinds and fries. DEAR GOD. I am not one for raving about things that are so simple, but the pork rinds really were as amazing as advertised. Light, airy, spicy, and crispy. The fries, fried up in duck fat, were smoky and delicious. I could've eaten a few orders of them.We went a little overboard with the food (not that there is such a thing?). We tried a wide swath of the menu, including some oysters, the fish stew, the ham plate, the country rib, sweetbreads, the apple salad, and the half chicken. All were great. The oysters were extremely, just-pulled-out-of-the-ocean fresh. Our table's oyster aficionados were very impressed and gobbled them down quickly. I had never had sweetbreads before, but I knew that I wanted them long ago, and I was impressed. Very lightly breaded and had a great texture to them. The country rib was another standout; so many rich complementary flavors and they melted in your mouth.We got one order of each dessert item and the waffle was the clear favorite, with its light, crispy texture and generous dollop of honey butter. The apple cider doughnuts were also great, but the sour cream ice cream they came with outshined them.This place was amazing, and totally worth the hype.

All he kept saying was, \"I'm in Germany! I'm in Germany!\". Obviously he wasn't but he certainly felt the restaurant had an Eastern European feel (he lived in Berlin for 4 months last year). I was jealous that he got to go there before me. We'd been trying to get reservations for weeks. Apparently he got a late-night reservation there while I was out of town. My first go at this restaurant was for brunch with that same BF. We called the day of for an 11:30 reservations on a Sunday and got in. When I walked in I could totally see why it reminded him of Germany. There's just this feeling you get. I think it's a combination of the lights and the design of the room with communal dining tables and hanging lamps. It's actually quite beautiful but not in the way that Eve or Perennial or Vermillion are. I totally, 100% loved it. There were little touches like the butter dish and the old-school silverware that reminded me of the ones I had when I was growing up. We split the sour cherry coffee cake to start with my very strong coffee (actually too strong for me). Then we split this pork shoulder sandwich (really, really good) with a side of bacon. Their bacon is nothing like I've seen. It was like bacon on steroids. I didn't care for it by my BF did. Lastly, we split a side of summer sausage. Summer sausage reminds me of going to the northwoods of Wisconsin with my Polish/Czech grandparents every summer because they would get this meat and make sandwiches. So this dish, as well as the whole restaurant, was very nostalgic for me.We got bloody mary's and they all come with a beer side car. Tasty!

Excellent french fries - they were greasy and probably fried in animal fat, just how McDonalds used to make theirs! :) We got a fresh citrus salad with fruit flown in from California, which was extremely yummy! The asparagus with escargot was good, but the snails were a little too greasy and overly fried for my taste. For dinner, I got the sweetbreads for my entree - it's a very popular veal dish, which tasted just like super yummy chicken nuggets! My bf got their specialty, which is the suckling pig.

Bouchot Mussels 1/2 order - THIS IS A MUST! I'm a fast eater usually but when I got to this plate, we just slowed down 10x and appreciated the taste of the mussels, the succulence of the sauce/soup. We ate and drank everything. If they made the sauce in the soup, I would drink this every day - it was so amazing. 3. Charcuterie plate \u00a01/2 order - One of my boyfriend's friend recommended this plate and I was actually a little disappointed by this plate. The meats are good but I would have done away with the pork pie and heady cheese. The sausage and mustard were the winners. 4. Country rib 1/2 order- This was from Slagel Family Farm (the restaurant's inspiritation). The meat had a slight sweetness in itself that was extremely surprising - and it wasn't from the sauce itself.

I don't even like carrot cake that much and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. The candied ginger is bomb.

If you enjoy exploring variety meats and sampling high-end beers (ranging from rare to novelty), you will LOVE The Publican. Chalk it up to luck if you must, but I have never had bad service here and, once the server figures out why I am there, (s)he is invariably effective in driving me to the delicious/curious meats and out-of-the-ordinary beers.First, the meats. Pig's head, duck hearts, 75-day aged beef, (remarkable) chicken liver pate. All done creatively and with a real respect for the ingredients. These are animal parts, after all, and it does seem to be a genuine respect. For example, the aged beef would have stood alone just fine. The addition of baby mackerel and grilled lemon added the umami (I know, don't hate) and acidity to complement the richness of the beef. And our server encouraged us to discover that combination. It worked. Also outstanding hams, traditional meat preparations (eg, porchetta) done well. And, by the way, they don't put anything on the menu that is \"disgusting\" so unless you are a vegetarian/vegan (not that there is anything wrong with that), cool it with the eeew looks. It is on the menu because it tastes good, not because the chef is showing off. Seriously, take a chance.Next, the beer. This is the only bar/resto where I have been excited when they tell me they are out of a beer because it usually means they have found something EVEN MORE awesome as a replacement...oh, yeah wine. And some whiskeys. But really, the beers. Local, Belgian, aged, flavored, dark, tart, light, fruity. You name it. And don't forget to buy a six-pack for the kitchen. Good karma.My suggestion is to avoid this place for brunch unless you are interested in meat and beer for brunch. To the point raised by a number of reviewers, the brunch service team (tired, disinterested, whatever) is not psyched to find a replacement bevvie for your iced tea and if you want an omelette, go to Egg Harbor. The dinner scene is busy and not quiet. I noticed recently that the music was turned down a bit, so the buzz was more crowd than techno-beat. Fine by me. And one last piece of advice, particularly for dinner, ask your server for advice.

We all LOVED the frites with egg and actually ended up ordering a second batch at the end of the meal because we kept raving about them. The pork shoulder was a bit dry and over-cooked, so we got the waffle and dessert liquour on the house. My mouth is watering thinking about the waffle with liqour as I'm writing this!

Everything is small plates and by small I do mean small, like tapas size or smaller. But expect a total Foodielicious experience!Here's what we ordered:The meats: -SPICY STEAK TARTARE was a delightful delicacy for rare meat lovers that we all raved about. Served with fresh veggie garnishes and a great flavor, I think this was one of my favorite standouts. -COUNTRY STYLE RIBS - we did the full order and this was a good comfort food dish, a better portion for a group of our size plus juicy and tender.-BOUDIN BLANC - at first glance, i was like, 'What! you get one tiny sausage to share between 5 people.\" but once you experience this dish, your taste buds will go haywire!. I think this was one of my favorites - the meat was so tender and had a wonderful flavor! It makes my mouth water just thinking about it now!The fish:- BEAU SOLIEL, SPANISH MACKEREL, AND STRIPED BASSok, I'm not afish lover and rarely eat fish, but i definitely ate this fish. It was so fresh, no fishiness and all the flavors of each dish generated \"ooo's and ahhhs\" from our group. -The Spanish Mackerel, though simple in presentatation, was very tasty - expect it to be on the salty salty side.-the Striped Bass was so memorable -served with cucumbers and almonds, this dish was my favorite fish dish.-The OYSTERS: A group of our size required the full order of 12, and it's worth it! Very fresh, I swear they must fly their oysters out to the midwest often! \u00a0The vegetables:- POREINI & KING MUSHROOMS: Definitely one of my favorite dishes. Our first reaction was \"what! this is all you get for $20!\" But again, once you taste the dish, you will know why you paid what you paid. The mint,balsamic and burrata just bursts with flavor in your mouth. We were all like \"wow\" and lip smacking =) . -ASPARAGUS - skip this dish, while it's good, it's nothing special and unique.-SUMMER SQUASH SALAD: While very fresh, it's not a good dish to split between 5 people - we each had like a piece of lettuce and a small veggie, so i can't comment on whehter it was special or not since i barely got a taste!DESSERT:-the waffle \u00a0dish and an apple pie w/icecream dish - this really topped off the meal.

The first thing that came to mind: the priceless Disney classic \"Newsies\" featuring a young Christian Bale singing about some hardship and stuff. The reason that is the FIRST thing that comes to mind is really beyond me. Maybe I just associate that movie with every newspaper now. You got me.After much deliberation on dates (and finding out what exactly The Publican actually was), I decided it was high time I try it out. My dad and I showed up pretty early on in the dinner rush thinking, rather naively I might add, that we would grab a drink somewhere close before heading over. After our options exhausted rather quickly, we decided to jump the gun on our reservation so when we arrived, the place was relatively empty. \u00a0This just gave me more room to take in the wonderful atmosphere.The whole feeling of the place is awesome. It sort of plays out like a barn that you and your family might have used to gather for a weekly meal. \u00a0Of course it has a full bar and is completely renovated to seat more people than I thought could honestly fit in, but it always felt very homely.The food really was delicious. We ordered up some of the country ham, country ribs and brown sugared sweet potatoes (which, to note, were OFF THE FIGURATIVE CHAIN.) Of course we tossed a few beers back from the fine selection of bottled and draft brews while we waited, just for good measure. But that's basically a given, right?The only thing that was slightly odd was they have a policy to bring your food out as it is ready. Which is fine and sort of a fun thing to do I guess, but there was no warning as to how long certain courses took to prepare or how many other orders were before you, so the length of time in between courses was weird. \u00a0We had ham about 20 minutes in, then ribs 40 minutes later, then sweet potatoes 10 minutes after that. \u00a0I know I shouldn't be concerned with the order and small intervals at which my food comes out, but I couldn't wrap my head around the process.All in all, I would definitely go back to this newspaper-named restaurant.

The Publican does pork perfectly. You guys can keep your oysters because when larger than life paintings of pigs adorn the walls, I know where Paul Kahan's devotion lies: the lowly swine. We arrived half an hour early but were cheerfully greeted and shown to our table immediately. Our waiter quickly appeared (I don't believe he ever gave us his name), told us about the menu and beer list and left us to peruse the day's offerings which, unfortunately, did not include the pork rinds. Our disappointment soon vanished, though, with the arrival of The Taste of Three Hams, which sounds like a demented fairy tale and tastes like a dream. Little did we know that things were about to get even better. Next, we were presented with the pork belly. The acid in the broth and the tomatoes is the perfect counterpoint to the fat of the pork belly. It was tender and roasted so that the crisp layer around the outside was caramelized and oh-so-lovely. Dreams of that pork belly will haunt me now and forevermore. What would have been a four out of five review became a solid five due solely to the pork belly dish. It's just that delicious.The lamb sausage is also tasty. Served in a curried yogurt with fresh, green chickpeas and carrots, it is spicy and savory and so good. We also had the farm chicken with summer sausage and frites, which were good, but after the pork belly (the pork belly!) and lamb sausage, it was not exactly the highlight of our dinner. For our sides, we had the daily pickles which pair perfectly with pork. We also opted for the shaved brussels sprouts with grilled onions, lemon and mint. Word to the wise: do not skip the shaved brussels sprouts. This side dish was absolutely fantastic. As for the service, it was flawless even though our waiter was a bit awkward at times. Our water glasses were never empty, one beer glass was quickly replaced with another and aside from an inexplicable lag in the arrival of the farm chicken, our plates came out one right after the other. I don't know what anyone else is talking about with regard to the value. We left The Publican perfectly sated and very happy with our evening. For three people, six beers, four plates to share and two vegetables, with tip our dinner was under $150. Seems fair to me. Do yourself a favor, do not skip the pork at The Publican.

You feel instantly that this is the kind of place chefs would hang out and eat on their own--a kind of hangout for the culinary cool when they want to cozy up to a Sunday paper and coffee and get away from all the fancy garnishes and big steaks that often define Chicago's restaurants. It's homey in very sceney, hip kind of way: a wide open, expansive dining space that at once says 'mess hall' as it does casual elegance. It comes down to you to read between the lines, though I'll confess, having patience for the hipper than thou waitstaff who seemed to be trained in charm by Anthony Bourdain would be helpful. It's by no means a quiet space--a large, open floor plan, the chatter of groups spreads and fills the restaurant. If you are looking for quiet or romantic, the Publican probably isn't for you, though owner Paul Kahan's Avec and Blackbird might just do the trick. Think of the Publican as their noisy, angsty brotheThere is a basic comfort about the food--a sort of unvarnished machismo that doesn't come off as shtick--big cuts of bacon, exceptionally tender poached eggs, pork chops, charcuterie, and the best soft pretzel I've found outside Germany. In some ways, the Publican is how you expect to eat in Chicago--the city of big shoulders should provide some hearty meals for those cold days--but my 5 years in the city found so few restaurants willing to be as cozy as the Publican.They love their beer selection--lots of Midwestern gems, though few are totally surprising in this part of the world. Rather, its the sheer diversity and supply that makes the Publican a treat for beer aficionados. In recent years, though, the taps seem to have taken a back seat to craft cocktails. The Publican always was ready and well positioned to be your barkeep of choice when fresh ingredients meet top shelf liquor. Now that the trend has arrived, it's hard to decide if the Publican is a beer place or a cocktail place.

After reading the Chicago Glutton review of the Publican, it became a high priority on the list of things-to-do in this great city of ours. So, following a delightful chamber music concert presented by the Chicago-Institute for the Law and Humanities, we made the short walk over to Fulton Market. Around 9 p.m. on a Tuesday night, the Publican was still going, but not too loud, and we were seated immediately. M later reported that he was put-off by the host, as his attempt at imitating Adrian Grenier's look was a little too literal. Regardless, the place looks great, as if sister-restaurant Avec had expanded and manned-up a bit. Hanging pendant lamps are beautifully repeated across the ceiling, but provide subdued lighting; you and your date will both look handsome here (not that M and I need any help in that department). Food (and libations): Just okay. The d-baggy expense accounters next to us highly recommended the mussels. Now, I had never had mussels before, so I was a little apprehensive about these. However, for a first experience, they were quite good--not chewy at all, covered in a light-ish butter sauce that gave way to just a hint of the sea after a few (hesitant) chews. However, we followed this with the half-chicken course, which was just too salty, nothing special. It sad atop a bed of ho-hum fries and oily, salty sauce. All of this was paired nicely with a Belgian Pale Ale. If I were to come back, I would get much less food and just enjoy one of the many great beers offered. In the interest of full disclosure, the beer recommendation wasn't brilliantly inspired. My teetotaler friends could have come up with the mussels/Belgian white combo. Still good, but the lack of creativity was kind of a drag.Service: A little funky. Started off with the Grenier-wannabe host, and things got weirder from there. Our waitress seemed drunk or high or something. Very wobbly, in a bobble-head way. She was very nice, but the wobbliness led to her pouring an entire glass of head rather than beer. Disappointing at such a beer-centric place. Also some creepy guy comes out with your food, so apparently her only function was to bob up and down while making recommendations to us. Adam Smith would be fascinated by this division of labor (and possibly the gratuity).Value: I'll just say, all of the above may have been forgivable, as this place does have a nice beer menu, a great location, and style.

I can understand some of the misgivings people have, but to me, the menu is unique enough to make this place worth visiting.We started off with the chef's tasting of the oysters. 6 different types of oysters, all fresh and delicious. I was very impressed by the freshness and diversity of the oysters. It's hard to find great oysters outside of high-end restaurants and I haven't seen this much variety anywhere not on the coast, so for me this is a huge draw.Another highlight was the sweetbreads which were lightly breaded and served with a very light, vinegary sauce. They were so good that we were able to convince a very picky eater at the table to try them (before we told her what sweetbreads are). She loved them, but refused to eat more when we spilled the beans. Also the squid ink pasta had excellent texture and deep flavor that complemented the shrimp it was served with perfectly. And of course the excellent pork rinds have been well documented. The fries (which I think are fried in duck fat) were very rich but the egg on top didn't add much for me. If I were to order fries again, it would be without the egg and preferably with a side of aioli.The only miss for me was the sturgeon which was rather flavorless, though I suspect this may be more a product of my preference for stronger tasting fish.Also I have to mention the top notch beer selection. I started off with a bottle of De Ranke XX which I had never seen before. It was a very hoppy Belgian IPA that seemed a little over-hopped, but I was glad I was able to try a different beer in one of my favorite styles. The second beer I had, which was on tap, was something that ended in Urbock (I forget the full name). I was expecting a nice malty German bock, but instead got the best rauchbier (smoke beer) I've ever had. It was creamy and only slightly smokey but enough to add tremendous character to the beer. The fact that Publican has a beer of this quality and rarity on tap is a huge selling point in my eyes.Publican specializes in fish, pork, and beer and I think they deal with all three in a way few other restaurants do.", "Date": "2009-10-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ashley C.", "ReviewID": "9o5WghGtSTfiF_BGN2ukoA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We ventured in for Sunday brunch to check the place out. \u00a0We called ahead to find out hours and how busy and it was recommended to have a reservation (which he made). \u00a0Upon arrival, everyone was friendly and helpful. \u00a0Even though we were a bit early and the kitchen wasn't opened, our waitress greeted us and got us drinks.

My wife's French Toast had a delicious caramelized crust surrounding the custardy inside, and the maple sausage had the perfect balance of maple flavor and wasn't too greasy.Publican's strength is in the fact that all of their dishes are made in house from start to finish, even their bacon and sausage.

I've had octopus in some very well established eateries and none of those could hold a candle to The Publican's octopus.  We also ordered the Spanish style seafood stew, the frites w/ egg and the aged duck breast. All of those dishes were wonderful. If the Chef keeps preparing food like this, I see another Michelin star in Kahan's future.  All in all, I think I'll be making a return trip to the Fulton Market area, The Publican has intrigued and impressed me, well done.P.S.

Since we visited on Sunday, we had the set-menu Sunday Dinner, which at $45/person, was priced pretty accurately, even if the portions were on the small side. It's a bit misleading in that each dish that was brought to us (minus the dessert) was served in a shared for-2 fashion, instead of separate dishes for each person. Might have been more accurate to price it as $90 dinner-for-2. Anyway, on to the dishes themselves:baby greens salad - It was the first menu item we'd seen in Chicago that even had avocado, so that was noteworthy. It also had grapefruit supremes, and a tasty dressing. (Husband is allergic to grapefruit, so they brought that out in a separate small bowl) This was good, but I had to refer to the iPhone photo that I took of the menu to remember what was in this salad, and the meal wasn't even a week ago.loup de mer - This was some type of small fish served whole, we weren't sure what kind. Perfectly roasted, super tender and juicy, but lots of small pinbones.choueroute: basically a big pan full of porky goodness. smoked pork chop (OMG tender and delicious), pork belly (a little more fatty than necessary, but also tasty, but WAY too small a portion for 2 people) & knackwurst on sauerkraut. I'm not a big sauerkraut fan, but it was pretty mild and enjoyable. The knackwurst was also smoky and delicious.apple tarte tatin: Again, tiny portion, and the pastry was much closer to a puff pastry texture than a tarte. Only 3 thin slices of (very tart, yay!) apple on top. The kicker with this was that it was topped with a vanilla ice cream studded with whole mustard seeds. WOW. It took us a minute to figure out where they'd hidden the mustard, but that flavor really enhanced the dessert. \u00a0I also had a (very small) glass of an ice cider with dessert, which was delicious and didn't taste nearly as strong as it was. This was also served in a very boring small juice-glass type of vessel that reminded me of my college cafeteria's glassware, so that was odd. Vibe:Service was great, very attentive to refilling your water and such, but really, could they put some lemon in the glass if they're going to serve tap water? No offense, but Chicago tap water just doesn't taste that good by itself.

It's not like they afford any real privacy, since they're so low...yet they're just high enough that the waitstaff has to keep opening them to reach over to clear plates and deliver dishes, so they're just kinda silly. The whole place seemed to be trying to straddle a line between upscale/sustainable/artisanal and salt-of-the-earth-workingman's cafe (which would match the neighborhood), and not doing either one especially well. \u00a0The much-vaunted beer list was, disappointingly, mostly comprised of imports rather than regional micros. \u00a0I really wanted to be bowled over by the Publican, but I just wasn't.", "Date": "2009-12-02", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Lauren W.", "ReviewID": "-MQeFRO4kxa3KFJGjMy5kQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good food!

It didn't help that nearly every patron was dressed in a business suit, making the restaurant seem duller.The food: just okay, really. The chef's selection of oysters were exactly what you'd find at half the other restaurants in town, and the farm chicken tasted as though it sat in the brine for far too long.

Not surprisingly, Publican jumped on the pork trend all the restaurants are following now, so there was plenty of serrano and pork rinds on the menu. Honestly, this little piggy would rather go to The Purple Pig, where the quality is simply better.The service: when beer is a staple on your menu, I expect you to know a thing or two about beer.

Go for brunch. You can eat brunch for $10-20, and you won't be sorry. Order the bacon plate ($7) for the table. It's very thick-cut and fatty in a way that melts in your mouth, and it's doused in maple syrup. I've had the chicken fried steak (4 stars), the hanger steak with grilled peaches (5 stars) and the red wine poached eggs with prosciutto (4 stars). 2. At dinner, order the whole chicken. It comes with fries and could easily feed a small table. No one wants to order chicken at the Publican because there are so many more intriguing options, but if you do, it will be one of the best chickens you've ever tasted.Finally, the interior is beautiful. The restaurant is in the old meatpacking district and the decorations are pig-themed. At the bathroom (which has fantastic soaps), you wash your hands in a communal trough. If you sit on the main wall you will sit in a booth with swinging doors, like a pig stall.

Unfortunately, we didn't have the greatest experience. First off, not worth the 1.5 hr wait we had when we got there near opening time on a Sunday. We actually had 1:30pm reservations, but we were hoping more for brunch, so we got there by 10:15a. The hostess escorted us to the waiting standing \"bar\" area, and we ordered some juice and coffee. As more and more people showed \u00a0up (a lot of people also had reservations), the ones who didn't have reservations were hanging out with us. At some point, we noticed everyone who arrived after us, somehow got seated first. WTH? They seemed very stingy with their seating, and what I also noticed was that they weren't very efficient in cleaning up and clearing tables out after people left. Onto the food. After we complained twice about waiting so long, we finally got seated, and they offered us complimentary a maple syrup pecan pastry (delicious!) and an apple cake (ok). I have to say, their coffee was really delicious as well, very smooth. But for our main course, I went with the pork belly bibimbap, one of my friends went with the waffle. Waffle was just okay according to my friend, and for me, the kimchi was just waaaay too overpowering in the bibimbap. We also ordered the maple glazed bacon which came out a few minutes after our main courses. It was good. When we wanted to pay our bill, it took a while for our waiter to come back to us.

The beer was just refreshing and added a nice little buzz to my punch. My friend ordered the Prophecy which was a mixture of Italian vermouth, bitters and an egg.

Having glanced at the menu earlier online, I knew we had to start with the waffle. It was crispy and very light, however it was accompanied with a honey butter and rhubarb compote. The compote was sweet and the honey butter was luscious. The combination of these with the waffle was heavenly. We moved onto the bacon plate and sausage sides. The bacon is more like a thick piece of pork belly placed on a tiny pool of maple syrup. Fatty and rich, it was pork candy. The sausage was not your typical breakfast sausage. It was the size of an Italian sausage;it was sweet and savory and fatty. The meal was going well so we decided to keep ordering. We ordered the duck hash. When it came out it was quite small and I was nervous the bf wouldn't be full after this meal. The duck was rich, but the eggs were awesome. I am usually not a big fan of eggs and these blew my mind. They were creamy and buttery. Combined with the duck it was perfect. We ended our meal with a pecan sticky bun. Not your average sticky bun at all. More butter, pecans and fatty deliciousness. I was full and ready to pay.This was when we started to get frustrated. The menu listed the sausage as a lower price than on the bill. Ok it was only a couple dollars, but still annoying.

Always had my water and coffee constantly filled and was constantly checked up on without being annoying, haha.Food:- Zucchini bread with blackberry and walnuts & ricotta cheese: SO yummy!! I didn't' expect it to be so delicious and decadent. I warn you to not get so full on this yet for more yummy things!- I got the red wine poached egg benedict. I personally did not think the red wine that it was poached in added anything much to the flavor, but I enjoyed that the hollandaise sauce wasn't overpowering. Proscuitto isn't really my thing, but I do admit that this was fresh and tender.- Friend got the works, with the biscuit, bacon, potatos, etc dish. It was ginormous and he seemed to like his dish too!Overall: I loved this place. Yes, it's a bit pricey but I thought it was worth it.

I'm talking about Paul Kahan and his presence during the change from top of the line fine dining (re: Trotter) to high end casual eating. The man has been highly praised for his work at Blackbird and avec, and understandably so. But the third installment to the Kahan legacy is all about swine...and why the hell not?Kahan pushes the envelop with this eatery, focusing his entire menu on poor Miss Piggy and a few seafood items (think things with shells). My friends and I stopped by The Publican for Sunday brunch and waited...........a long time. So long, my fianc\u00e9e fell asleep. True story. But eventually we were seated in a pig pen-style booth, swinging doors and all. Adding to the decor are some of the most beautiful balls I've ever seen. Rows, columns of globes lined the ceiling in what has to be one of the most interesting lighting designs I've ever seen. With that said, its obvious why The Publican received the James Beard Award for decor. Simply amazing.But what truly separates a Kahan restaurant from any other is the food itself. The concept of an all-pig restaurant might frighten some, but it sings beautiful music to others (including myself). As mentioned, we had brunch, and the menu had many familiar items, including waffles, biscuits & gravy, and an omelette. But the most intriguing items were further down the menu: hanger steak, maple-glazed pork shoulder, bucatini alla carbonara, duck confit hash. Yes. Oh sweet mother, yes. Fianc\u00e9e ordered the carbonara, and take a wild guess what I ordered?Yep, the maple-glazed pork shoulder. What did ya think?Portions aren't huge, but what it lacks in size (insert chuckle), it makes up in taste. The carbonara, served with pork belly, eggs and parmesan cheese, was divine. The dish was very delicate, and also delectable. The saltiness of the pork belly adds a lot to what would be a very traditional take on carbonara.The words \"maple-glazed pork shoulder\" might not roll off your tongue, but it rolls off mine..and happily to my belly. Sweet. Salty. Fragile. A sunny-side up egg lies on top of the pork shoulder, adding an interesting texture. Underneath all that was a bed of grits, kale, and pickled red onion, rounding out the rest of the taste buds. If it was socially acceptable to lick a giant plate, I'd do it. Just sayin'.But please, whatever you do, do not leave here from brunch without ordering some bacon. Yes. Bacon. Something so simple done so perfectly. Maple syrup-braised bacon. It's what dreams are made of..and I know this for a fact because my fianc\u00e9e woke up the other day saying she dreamt of this bacon.Music is...interesting. Goes from some legit hip hop to Party Rock Anthem (yes, people were shufflin') to indie rock. But what made the afternoon was the random ringing of the cowbell. Not sure why or if it had any significance, but it got everybody's attention.

It was seasoned very well. We both put on top of bread!Next we ordered the Pork Belly and the Serrano Ham. Serrano ham was like prosciutto but smoother and fluffier; very good on goat buttered bread that came with. Melts in your mouth: says the hubs. Oh the pork belly... It was mouthwatering, melt in your mouth, oh so AWESOME! Wow I just ate fat basically with some crisp and lots of flavor! Nah there was meat too which was very tender.

I wished there was a little bit more kick to it like spice then it would have been perfect. I really liked the peanuts in there the best out of all the garnish that was on top. I didn't like the dragon tongue beans but hubs did. The meat itself was so fatty again but just melts in your mouth again. Wow.

The family style dining concept worked out well, allowing us to try several of their entrees and desserts while juggling the platters on a small table. They brought the food out in a staggered fashion such that we were eating for quite a while. We started with the arctic char with serrano ham, the asparagus with olives, the sirloin and the farm chicken with frites. By far the best bites were from the sirloin and the chicken. The huge wood roasted chicken was sliced and seasoned to perfection. \u00a0It was complemented by the generous helping of fries underneath which soaked up all the good juice from the chicken. Dessert consisted of the chocolate tart, which was full of chocolate, caramel and peanut goodness and toasted marshmallow. \u00a0We also split the vanilla vacherin, which was a strange combination of meringue, orange sherbet, rhubarb ice cream, whipped cream, strawberries and a candied orange peel. Surprisingly, it worked.The Publican offers a fantastic menu but the table service needs serious work. Our waiter was visibly preoccupied with other tables, accepting orders from fellow servers as we attempted to clarify questions about the menu. The busboy swiped our drinks, which we were still drinking and we had to call out to him to bring them back. We were assuming that he was just trying to clear our table, but that was a bit rude.

Executive Chef Paul Kahan and Chef de Cuisine Brian Huston have developed a network of purveyors to supply the restaurant with hand-selected, sustainably-harvested fish and seafood as well as sustainably-raised heirloom pork to anchor a rustic menu of simple, eclectic fare. The extensive international beer list, developed by partners Eduard Seitan and Terry Alexander, features 100 or so ales, lagers, stouts and ciders by the bottle, 12 of those available on tap.

I also enjoyed the kobe sirloin for my entree, which was both delicious and refreshing. I was surprised when our server did not ask how I would like my meat cooked and typically I like my meat well done; however it came out medium rare and it was actually amazing.

Yes, it is truly loud in there. Not a place to take your hard-of-hearing parents, unless they don't care about conversing and just want to enjoy some good food. But the vibe is fun, young, and fits the casual atmosphere and attitude of the restaurant, so I think it's acceptable. We were glad to be seated at one of the 'private' 2-tops by the windows so the noise level was totally manageable, but the communal seating probably got a lot louder as it's closer to the center of the room's \"waiting for your table while you drink really good beer and wine\" area. But more importantly: THE FOOD. We had:- Spicy pork rinds (which normally I would never eat, but my husband wanted them, and then I ended up scarfing a few too, they're just that good)- Potted rillettes (pulled-pork texture, deliciously-spiced, with sour cherries, spreadable on crusty bread)- Scallops (omg, perfectly cooked with a wonderful sauce and accompaniments)- Morel mushrooms (strangely I think I have cooked fresh morels better at home, but I did love the accompanying pea puree and sauce)- Pork belly (perfectly accompanied with pea shoots and a bit of spicy chorizo)- \u00a0Rhubarb crumble dessert (biiiig chunks of rhubarb, just the way I like it - but wish it were topped with a bit of ice cream instead of just whipped cream)We really enjoyed our meal although I wish they had spaced it out a little more - it seemed like as soon as we finished (or even before we finished) one dish, they had brought out another, so we were out of there pretty quickly.

I know some people hate the community table, but at the Publican, the table turns every so often, creating a semblance of some privacy for your group.

We settled on seven dishes for our party of three (well, it does say that the plates are to share, so...) and our waiter kindly pointed out that we wouldn't need more than 3-4 dishes. He was very helpful in helping us narrow down our choices.1) Mussels with celery, garlic, and yummy broth. Served with very fresh, hot, crusty bread that is perfect for sopping up the deliciousness of the broth. (half order)2) Fried clams with fried green tomatoes & arugula. How did they manage such crispy breading w/o making it greasy at all?3) Farm chicken with summer sausage and frites. OMG this chicken was cooked perfectly. It was so tender and juicy. The sausage was smoky. The frites were crunchy and great to soak up the juiciness of the chicken. (half order. these are big chickens if that was a half).4) Summer corn with lime, aioli, parmesan and magic. It comes in a tiny bowl, but it's really rich. I know. it's corn. But it's soooo good.

I guess I should start off by saying, except for bacon, I don't like pork. I would never order pork chops and aside from big star, I don't consider pork belly delectable. But, at Publican, nearly everything on the menu is pork.... waffles with pork, french toast with pork, rye bread with pork, lettuce with pork, pork, pork, pork.... Now: the experience. We arrived promptly for our 1:00 PM reservations, starving. They seated my girlfriend and I at the corner of a communal table. We were handed our menus and seconds later a cylindrical container filled with pork rinds. Our first thought was \"sweeeet, free fried things like a Mexican restaurant\"--followed closely by our second thought, \"holy shit, these are pork rinds, I'm going to puke\". It turns out that they mistakenly put them on the table. As it turns out, you actually have to ORDER and PAY for these things. Word to the wise: DON'T ORDER THE PORK RINDS if you have taste buds or are not married to a sibling or close cousin. After clearing up the pork rind mess, we ordered our drinks. Two OJs. What said \"fresh squeezed\" on the menu tasted dangerously close to Tropicana. And now that you know my feelings about pork, you can assume that we steered clear of pork items on the menu for our entrees. I ordered the pastrami short ribs with sweet potatoes, and my girlfriend ordered smoked trout with rye. On the side we ordered the fries with a fried egg on top. The pastrami turned out to be decent--very tender but not something I would typically categorize as a brunch item. The trout was bland and the accouterments were coleslaw-esque. We expected something similar to lox and cream cheese. The trout was thick and the creaminess of the side items were a little too much for brunch food. The fries actually never came (they did, however, make it to the bill...) so who knows how those taste. The service, as demonstrated by the misplaced pork rinds and the absence of our fries, lacked. Although there were many, many waiters, it seemed like we could never find ours.

Start with some oysters. \u00a0They are flown in from everywhere. \u00a0Vancouver--Washington State-Mass--Va. \u00a0 Fresh has been risen to a new standard in the mid west. \u00a0The cured meats are an absolute delight.

The suckling pig was just that. \u00a0Succulent and dancing with spice and sweetness. \u00a0The rabbit papperdelle is hearty and robust but not at all gamey.

One can only imagine what dessert is like given how wonderful everything else is (and it is!). \u00a0But explore that on your own. \u00a0Some sweet options round out this a la Scott fav.

The fried perch was definitely the best fried fish I've ever eaten. \u00a0It was crispy, yet not overly filling. \u00a0The homemade tartar sauce, added a bright, smooth, lemony flavor. \u00a0No detail was overlooked, all the way down to the chopped pickles. \u00a0I was a bit puzzled by the shaved parmesan, but somehow the cheese and fish mixture worked again. \u00a0The sweet potato rounds that came with it were equally crispy and their deep, earthy flavor mellowed out the sharpness of the parmesan.Just when I thought things couldn't get any better, the Trout arrived. \u00a0It was served whole, but de-boned. \u00a0Free tip: \u00a0If your server asks if you want him to filet it for you, respectfully decline, as you would miss out on the delicious crispy fish skin. \u00a0The fish itself was tender, moist, flavorful, and rich. \u00a0The artichokes that it came with were cooked and seasoned perfectly and I can only imagine how much more amazing the dish is with bacon in it. \u00a0The sauce that accompanied it was somewhat of a stock and tied the entire plate together. \u00a0The squash arrived last and frankly, I was not that impressed with it. \u00a0The dish was billed as squash with cremini mushrooms and cipolini onions, but the mushrooms far overpowered everything. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the mushrooms were delicious, but when I order squash, I expect lots of squash-that wasn't the case. \u00a0Granted, I bet if we received this dish first instead of last we would have raved about it. \u00a0At that point, the bar was set so high they could have served us beluga caviar and I probably would have thought it was just \"ok.\"Overall, this is a great place to go if you want creative, upscale cuisine without the pretentious, upscale attitude. \u00a0It's great for a celebration and definitely worth the price-especially if you're not paying.[Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp. \u00a0My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare. \u00a0On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant. \u00a0I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family. \u00a0I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]", "Date": "2010-10-26", "Author_Location": "Minneapolis, MN"}, {"Author": "Don J.", "ReviewID": "z3lWN2gqcyz7u_K_ybcf2Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went back to Publican over the weekend and had a very enjoyable Brunch.

Call me crazy, but I am not a fan of eating extremely expensive food in an environment inspired by a slaughterhouse. The seating options are as follows - you can either eat at the bar, with people you don't know at a long table built for vikings, or in what is basically an enclosed pig pen. I just know someone is having a good laugh at the idea that people will pay a lot of money to sit in a pen and get treated like an animal and that idea haunted me through out my meal. Not only is eating in a pen fairly claustrophobic, but it gave the restaurant a Patrick Batemen-esque vibe that I cannot forgive. I will say that the food was okay, but not enough to make up for the unpleasant seating, or really even good enough to justify the cost. We ordered two things I had heard people rave about (the pork belly and pork rinds) and thought both were pretty average. My group of four split three desserts and I can honestly say that I disliked ALL of them. The trifle tasted like it had croutons in it, I kid you not. And there is something offensive about selling a perfectly ordinary waffle with butter and jam for $7! My favorite dish was actually the brussels sprouts, served on a bed of cheese, which was very tasty. If I could somehow magically eat those again without entering the restaurant, I would. I know someone somewhere is reading this review, a tear in their eye, cursing me as a vegan, but that is not the case. I love bacon; I just don't like Publican.

One of the best items we tried. \u00a0 \u00a0 Steak Tartare - A \u00a0steak tartare, what can I say.

Luckily, they also have a very knowledgeable \"beer expert\" that can help you pair with what you are eating. The Saison with the oysters was a good call.Service:This is where the bottom fell out. Our server was HORRIBLE. He greeted us promptly, but then we said we need just a minute to look at the beer list he left us for 15 minutes before returning. When we asked him about popular items and to describe a few things he acted like it was a huge inconvenience. After the first round of beers our glasses sat empty for a good 10-15 minutes before he checked back. We actually started ordering from the food runners because they seemed to care more than our server and checked back. The server dropped off the check and then proceeded to go to the host stand and chit-chat for 10 minutes. This is was when I finally, got up, tracked down a manager and complained. It takes a LOT for me to get up and complain out a server. The manager listened intently and apologized for the inconvenience. Cost:It's billed as a high end restaurant, it's not cheap. I didn't think it delivered an experience or food aligned to the prices. 12 oz bottles of beer run from $5 up to $20. \u00a0The food was somewhat overpriced for the portion and quality. Other considerations:The one cool thing Publican has going for it is the concept behind the restaurant - communal beer house.

They wouldn't put something on the menu that wasn't \u00a0good.\" I also asked the server how they were. She said they were creamy. Well, I *guess* they could be considered creamy. But mostly they were lumpy, with me having to chew a little grit or five in each bite. I've never had to chew grits like that. On the other hand, the flavor was great. It was just the consistency/texture that was off. 7. The service was a little lackluster, as they were not good with coffee or water refills, but the staff made up for it in kindness.

The walls were covered in a terracotta like embossed print, a long gold-lined bar sat in front of the open kitchen, and bright globe lambs hung in a rectangular cluster in the center of the room. \u00a0Seating is essentially a small number of walnut booths equipped with their own saloon style doors, a few stand alone deuces and four-tops, a set of wooden communal tables organized into a rectangle with matching high-backed chairs and a few cocktail standing tables for drinking and snacks. As for d\u00e9cor, it's all about the swine. No sexy mirrors, no eclectic trinkets, just a few large paintings of even larger pigs. \u00a0A very appropriate way to commemorate the Jewish sins we were about to commit (just in case we didn't get our fix at the Purple Pig). From inside our little saloon cove, we felt the entire experience to be decidedly quite comfortable, warm and welcoming and the service to follow suit. Our server was adorably cheerful for a dreary Saturday morning, helping us with our tourist inquiries and mapping out our shopping route for us. He also ensured our water and coffee cups were consistently replenished, and that side plates and cutlery were plentiful.Speaking of drinks, the Publican offers all the morning classics- mimosas, G+ Ts, Bloody Marry, juice, coffee and tea. No cappuccino machine, unfortunately, so I had to opt for basic drip ($3), which I found a little bitter for my taste. \u00a0Thankfully, the food helped make up for it with a little extra salt and sugar to balance everything out. The Publican's brunch menu reads like a #foodporn fantasy, taking greasy spoon favourites up a few notches on the sexy scale. With global cuisine influences from Italy, Eastern Europe, Asia, there were no shortage of tempting picks- the challenge for us was going to try to be sensible and not order the entire menu for two. With a little help from our server, we ended up going with:Smoked Arctic Char, Grilled Snap Peas, Radish, Yogurt, Poached Egg & Charmoula ($16)A light and refreshing start to the day. Once cracked into, the yolk added incredible richness to the tangy yogurt, the fresh green peas, and the slightly bitter radish. \u00a0The fish had a lovely sweetness to it that was balanced out by the herbaceous and bright charmoula and a bit of aromatic curry seasoning throughout. If you're looking for a lighter brunch option, this would be ideal.Oven Baked Sourdough Pancake with Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Thigh, Breakfast Sausage, Burton's Maple Syrup ($13)And if you're not looking for a light, healthy option, this is the one to choose. But believe me, it's totally worth it. The pancake was fluffy on the side, but deliciously crispy on the sides and bottom from a good searing in the cast iron pan. The bacon thighs and sausage were sweet, salty and just soaked up all that maple syrup to yield one unapologetically delicious bite. Love, love, love.Pub Pretzel with Lady Chris' Pimento Cheese ($4)A stark shift in flavour profile from the latter dish, but still a pretty tasty snack. My first bite of the pimento cheese reminded me a bit of Cheez Whiz, but it wasn't long before I was hooked. The pretzel itself was really tasty- nice and tender inside, with a good satisfying chew on the surface. Yum.So for 2 coffees, an OJ, 2 mains and a side, the bill came to about $50 including tax and tip. Not a cheapo diner breakfast, but definitely a worth-while meal. I loved the Eastern European communal atmosphere, and the food offerings were both familiar yet intriguing. Thanks Publican for getting us through a food coma with more delicious food. I would definitely be up for a repeat visit (maybe for dinner or late night drinks) any time I'm in Chicago again.

The Publican focuses on pork, oysters, and beer. The beer list is very extensive that at first glance it could look intimidating especially with the excellent myriad of beers made up of local and international microbrews that a lot of people have probably not heard of. But, ask your server anything about beer and he/she will have answers for you. Tell your server what type of beer you like e.g. wheat beer vs. hoppy beer, and they will have recommendations. Or, say that you like Blue Moon, and asked what beers are similar to that. They will have answers for you. The caramelized pork belly is always a pleaser and arguably one of the best we have had. A bite of the pork belly melts in the mouth each time. The aged ham is always a must-have for us. We generally like to do a taste of three hams since each variety has its own characteristics. The little gem salad is also very good and it comes with crispy pig ears! Mmm! Don't be afraid of it. It hardly tastes anything like what it sounds. And of course, get the oysters.

I had a seat at the bar and immediately felt like there should be more room. The bar is only about 12 deep so the plates and glasses really have no where to go. Also, they pack you really close to the people next to you. Its a bit of an uncomfortable position. The gentlemen next to me had the sardines and I waited for them to finish their dish so the odor wouldn't ruin my tuna crudo experience. The place is an audible disaster. I like a buzzing restaurant but it sounded like the old RCA dome in Indianapolis where extra sound is being piped in during Colts games. I never thought a place could be this loud. The noise level was actually painful and distracting at time and I am not exaggerating one bit. Go there on a busy night and you'll completely agree.Now on to the food. I had the tuna crudo. I usually hate using superlatives but it was the best piece of fish I have ever eaten. The tuna was a translucent and creamy pink with a consistent texture and divine flavor. The pistachios and pickled lemon were an excellent compliment to the fish. I could have eaten 3 orders of the tuna crudo.The pork rillettes could have been much better. I know a rillette is supposed to have lots of salt but this dish had a mouth puckering amount. It was definately more than other rillettes I have had. The cherries seemed to be a separate component of the dish. I would have like to have seen the cherries chopped to make a kind of relish to use on the toast so you can get the pork and cherry on each bite. Otherwise it was just an OK dish.This was the first time I had sweetbreads so I really have no comparison. I found there to be a great amount of flavor and texture in the hearty serving of sweetbreads themself. I felt the outer coating should have been crisiper to contrast the gooeyness of the actual sweetbreads. The mushrooms were a great savory compliment. It was an overall good dish.The service was very good but not without criticism. My server Paul, had an exceptional amount of knowledge of the food and beer. He claimed to be working in the industry for 25 years and it showed. He did however bring me a different beer than what I ordered. I don't know if it was his fault or the result of the audible tsunami behind him. He did try to steer me to the tubot and other side items to increase my bill. I know its their job to do that but it get annoying especially when i was already dropping a good amount of money. Paul did give me a few extra tastings of beers and a beautiful fortified malbec that was like a good desert port. I was pretty happy with his service.The Publican is a high quality restaurant, there is no doubt of that. However, there are a few things that need to be improved to make it exceptional.

Upon arrival, and by first looks, it reminded me of NYC's meatpacking district before it became the \"IT\" place to be, when restaurants and shops first started opening there and the seediness of it started fading. It was large, open, trendy, cool and fun. The decor (I was told) was modeled after a Bavarian? (not so sure on that) old-school beer hall. The tables were long and communal (in the center), w/ the expanse of the tables wrapping around the corners of the restaurants and high back chairs as the seat. Along one wall had these super cool booths w/ doors that closed, reminding me of a freight train that was about to pull off.As for the brunch menu, it was definitely different from the norm. The dishes ranged from fried french toast to sausages and a pretzel to a red wine poached egg. We opted for the sausages and pretzel. It was strange and way different from our normal breakfast, but since nothing on the menu looked \"normal\", we figured we'd just go along for the ride. (Word of caution though, the sausages or \"weiswurst\" was served in a silver pot filled w/ hot water. At first look, it was alarmingly simple and somewhat unappetizing. Don't let that offput you.) As for the drinks, we were told that it was customary in Chicago to get a beer w/ your Bloody Mary for brunch. The boyfriend and I both thought that was weird but hey... so is a sausage and pretzel for brunch. That said, he decided to try it while I had their $6 french pressed coffee. Both were yummy.

Not really my style and I was starving by the time I got to Publican. Unfortunately, this was the only time they had that fit our schedule.

Arrived at 8:55PM and stood near the \"bar\" area which I thought was super cool and unique. We could see all the dishes passing by and actually chatted with some random people who were standing at our bar table. The bf and I had the Brasserie St. Feuillien (abbey style), which was light and crisp, just the way I love my beer. They come in cute beer cups too.15 minutes later, we were seated in a long communal table which I typically don't like but for some reason, I didn't mind this time. We chatted with a couple seated next to us and were recommended some dishes. Our waiter was \"typical\", nothing unique about him but he did know his dishes and did let us know that we would have more than enough dishes for the four of us. Here is our list of food in the order it came out:Dozen oysters (4 bagaduce, 4 kusshi, & 4 penn cove) - amazing oysters! so fresh and crisp.Frites with George's organic eggs- Nothing spectacular but it was surprising how eggs go along with fries! You need to eat a piece of fry with a piece of egg and you will understand that it goes perfect.Sweet Potatoes - AMAZING. How can sweet potatoes go so well with capers? \u00a0I dislike capers but it was crunchy and deliciousss. Best sweet potatoes dish ever! Provencal fisherman's stew - mussels were so damn good! the sauce is savory too. You have to put the sauce inside with the mussel so you can eat it together. YUMMY YUMMY. Lamb meatballs - There was only two meatballs but each couple got to share one. Although they weren't too big, they were pretty chewy and savory. Perfect.Duck - SO GOOD. The skin was crispy and the meat was so unbelievably tender. IT WAS FANTASTIC.At this point, my stomach was bulging and I was having trouble eating cause I was so full but I still wanted to try the remaining dishes so I had couple bites of the last two.Chicken - When this dish came out, I was like Oh, here's a dish I won't like finally. It looks plain and simple. \u00a0WRONG! How do they get this chicken so tender? It was the best chicken hands down. I am not a huge fan of chicken, too much chicken gets me sick but I almost didn't want to put my fork down cause it was so good.Ribs - Finally our last dish! Amazing amazing. Meat so tender, and sauce so tasty. We didn't get to finish the last two dishes so we bagged it and quite frankly, everyone was super happy with this choice of restaurant. YAY ME! OK, so I give the food A plus plus PLUS. Interior is very unique and decorative with huge pictures of fat pigs (huh?!) It kind of reminded me of my fat dog. HAHA. Love high ceilings and I love the whole wood theme. I am not a fan of communal seating but it was a great experience here. The bathrooms are quite interesting but I got to say that I am a huge fan of it. I was going to give this place 4 stars because we had to wait about 15 minutes and we had a reservation but since the food was so good, I let it slide.

The Tennessee ham, they said, was salty but good. The Virginia ham was the first that induces a smile on their faces. The third ham apparently reminded them of some ham they'd had in Spain, for they spoke of how it melted on their tongues. Needless to say, they were quite happy.For their main entr\u00e9e, they ordered a whole chicken. Not being a rabid pescatarian, I sampled a piece and was quite satisfied. The chicken had been rubbed or marinaded in oregano. You'd think that oregano was only for spaghetti sauce. Apparently not as far as Publican goes.

When we arrived we were told there would a be 20-25 minute wait. We didn't mind, seeing as we had just tried Little Goat Diner who had an almost 2 hour wait... Plus, we were told that we could enjoy drinks at their standing tables while waiting to be seated. We ordered a couple of bloody mary's and a few oysters to start. We were then happy to be seated at a table in under 10 minutes! The service was top notch; very friendly and easily transitioned our appetizers and drinks to the table.What we ordered:--Traditional Bloody Mary--What's not to like about a bloody that's constructed with homemade celery bitters and topped with pickled vegetable garnish? It was even served with a Zombie Dust beer sidecar. This was an excellent bloody mary, that had the perfect amount of kick. \u00a0--Oysters: Sea Cow, Raspberry Point, Marin Miyagi--Served with a deliciously tart vinaigrette sauce, these oysters were incredible. Our rule of thumb: any month that has an 'R' in it's spelling is the best time to enjoy these wonderful tastes of the ocean.--Publican Winter Salad--This was a delicious, light salad made with frisse, beets, persimmon, cashel blue cheese, pomegranate and pepita seeds. It is perfect for someone in the mood for a light brunch, but could also be ordered as a shared starter to other dishes on the menu. This is a salad we will remember... and maybe even try to recreate! Loved.--Shrimp & 'Nduja Stew--A delicious spiced broth served with ricecake noodles, chinese broccoli, whole shrimp, and a perfectly-cooked slow cooked egg. Definitely not the right dish to order on a first date, as it can get quite messy. That being said, it is worth it, as the dish is packed with tons of flavor. In addition to Brunch, we strongly recommend visiting The Publican for dinner out! On previous visits, we have sat at the large communal table, which is a great way to see what other people are enjoying. We love the small plate menu offerings.

Perfect temperature, not pierced, and they were served with a little piece of paper which detailed where the different types were on the plate - genius idea! The charcuterie plate was phenomenal. The different types of cured meats were so unique - and went well with the pickled cauliflower, grainy mustard, preserves spread, and cornichons. Next was the snow crab, which was tossed in \u00a0some sort of herb butter/oil sauce. AMAZING. Definitely worth the mess that comes along with cracking open crab legs. I think my least favorite part of the dinner was the blood sausage. Even though it was really good, I just don't think it was really 'my thing'.

Two major highlights for me were the chef's choice oysters and the charcuterie plate. They source their meats as much as possible directly from the source as opposed to using a big distributor. It was especially cool to see jamon Iberico from Salamanca, Spain as I used to live there and have had a very difficult time finding its' cured deliciousness in the U.S. Another great aspect to the menu is that while it may seem expensive to people from the provinces it is actually quite reasonable for a Chicago restaurant with this kind of quality. They also had a very good wine and cocktail list which is always a plus.The service further advanced the experience as the staff were knowledgeable and friendly.

So light, but not stingy with the serving. This is served sashimi-ish, so it's raw. Delish. Great flavor combinations, especially with the fennel.Mussels: I've never had them like this, all broth-y with celery. A little on the tame side, but the peasant bread that comes with it that you can dip in the broth is very good. I usually love mussels but wasn't blown away. I will, however, say that these were some of the best quality of mussels I've ever had. Plump, healthy, flavorful.

I think this dish tries to simply feature the mussel, which is fine, and appropriate considering, as I said before, these are really great quality mussels. \u00a0Beets: AMAZING. Really. And not just b/c I love beets in general. It was so earthy and it came with a savory flavored sour cream (I would guess it was flavored with chive and truffle oil) \u00a0that went perfectly with the vinaigrette (guessing balsamic) and sweetness of the beets.

I remarked that any place where I can see the chefs at work behind the mesmerizing stainless steel facade of the kitchen is a place where I'd feel right at home. Locally sourced? A definite plus.Initial snickering at the incubator-looking booths aside, we were seated side by side at the corner of one of the long tables that ran along the main room. How considerate, I pondered to myself, that rather than placing us somewhat awkwardly between two different conversations across from each other - mind you, these tables are about as private as economy seats on a sold-out US Airways flight - we could hear each other speak. Though I wished we had a private table to ourselves.\"You'll love this place for all things pig\", he mentioned, and boy was he right. I've had a curiosity for pork rinds ever since i saw them on the Food Network but for some strange reason, my home city of Boston does not deliver in abundance. The Publican did. Greasy, crisp, with a dash of cheese and spice. I wish it could have been spicier, but that is not the point, I downed more than my fair share.Oh before that, we had the oyster sampler too. Since I average so many Island Creeks every month that any more would send me straight to homesick highway, I took the west coast oysters and he took the east coast ones. Perfect and fresh, high flavor packed into a small package, though I wish there was more to the sauce.Sweet potato sformato. It was finger licking good, a perfect mound of heavenly mush coating my mouth.No pork belly available, but our waiter, who reminded me of a street saxophone player with his chill drawl, suggested the suckling pig with truffled rice soubise and cabbage.

I go to bed dreaming of it. I'm drooling just thinking of the food. Fair warning - I am sucker for pork belly so I may be a bit biased here since it is probably my favorite dish; however, I've also had my fair share of mediocre pork belly and will admit when it's just okay. I may be partially influenced by the phenomenal beer I was drinking with my meal, but I insist that this is the best pork belly that I have yet to consume. They give you a slab of pork belly that is about two playing cards in length (but a little thinner in width). Your teeth first hit a crispy skin brushed with a slightly tangy Asian sauce, and sink into the buttery flesh of pork belly which simply melts in your mouth. One bite and you are taken to another world. Before the pork belly, was the duck prosciutto. Generally, I enjoy prosciutto but don't go crazy over it. This duck prosciutto was not kidding around. Served with delicate slices of cheese, strawberries and arugula. The salty and sweet flavors burst in your mouth, melting together in pure joy and once again, melting in your mouth the way fine food should. I was mid sentence when this sucker went into my mouth - stopped, paused, eyes widened and looked up in bliss, lost my train of thought and said \"holy crap, this is amazing.\" While it was a bit pricey (we spent $50/person), it was completely worth it. We also got the tuna, which was good but not mind blowing. The half chicken was \u00a0juicy, and full of flavor. It's just not at the top of my list since chicken, in general, is not my favorite.

Seating was interesting. One side had long wooden communal tables, and the left end had interesting booths with individual doors. Near the front entrance were couple traditional table/seats for smaller parties. On to food and drinks.Drinks: Smoked Bloody Mary and Bloody Mary. Both were excellent, and the bloody mary I got was perfectly spicy, slightly sour and complete with a mixture of pickled vegis on top. The smoked bloody mary was very interesting, it had a porky flavor that was good, but for me, slightly too \"meaty\". Appetizer: Half dozen mixed oysters. Varieties included those from Washington State, New Zealand, West & East Coat, etc. Very very fresh.Mains: Brisket & Eggs: Oh man, this was amazing. The brisket had the right amount of char on the outside for some texture, and the meat fell apart in tender chunks. The meat was seasoned well and the fried sunny-side up egg on top played a good supporting role. The tomato \"Salsa\" on top was also good, didn't really fight the flavors of the brisket but I could've done without it. Blood Sausage: My friend's blood sausage was excellent. Smoky, and rich with a full meaty flavor. The casing snapped well and did not come off in stringy bits. Maple Ham French Toast: My other friend's dish. A great sweet dish, if you're not feeling the savory choices. The toast seems to have been crisped after being doused with syrup because it was not soggy but slightly crispy on the exterior.

The execution was flawless and the flavor combo was again stunning. \u00a0Fish & cheese? \u00a0Yep, it worked wonderfully. \u00a0The zucchini was nice and al dente...really fresh flavor came through, which is hard to do when frying - never mind how great the perch tasted on its own.Suckling pig: \u00a0nuff said. \u00a0I don't even remember the accompanying sauce/reduction/veg...the pork was so over the top...it just flaked apart with ease. \u00a0A1. \u00a0They killed it on one of their signature offerings, so bravo to treating the pig with respect.I was also able to try some of the beef sirloin, which was done medium (even thought they suggested med-rare), and came with a crazy set up of cherries, crunchy hazelnuts and some crisp arugula. \u00a0I don't really eat beef/steak anymore, outside of occasional burgers, and this was a well crafted dish that even I enjoyed.On top of the great food is great ambiance. \u00a0It's an insanely awesome interior design job...minimal European flair. \u00a0Really comfortable vibe and cool layout, with a ton of community seating in the middle, and the rest of the tables along the walls. \u00a0The whole place had a very casual vibe while still retaining a subtle, unpretentious chicness.The service was very good, as well. \u00a0Maybe the quickest refills and plate takeaways I've ever seen...the runners were definitely on top of their game. \u00a0The wine list is short, but decent and the beers are even better - Zombie Dust on tap alone gets 5/5 stars. ;)As far as after dinner ops went, a massive French press of a custom Intelligentsia blend was absolute heaven. Perfect temp and extraction.The only thing that sort of missed was the panna cotta. \u00a0It was way too set, likely from being served at much too cold of a temperature. \u00a0The macerated sour cherries and pistachios on top were good in concept, but the sweetness of the cherries overpowered the delicate sweetness of the cream. \u00a0Oh well...a minor misstep.Can't wait to hit this place up again. \u00a0Fan-effin'-tastic.", "Date": "2012-07-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Renee K.", "ReviewID": "7txiuwASv3XZv9dz-4DXRQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My friend wanted to go here for her birthday dinner, so we went.

Next the chef's selection of oysters which tasted fresh (a quality I find immensely important in my oysters) served with just a light champagne vinaigrette (neither added nor detracted so....)The smoked trout with heirloom tomatoes, guanciale (non-smoked bacon) & fromage blanc was tasty but served on bread, which isn't mentioned on the menu; I thought it took away from the dish slightly. But the fromage blanc was speared on said bread so to get that flavor well, you had to eat the bread.Ok, than there was the suckling pig with grapes, escarole & grits.

Dishes of note: the potted rillettes (divine) the ham chop in hay (really big, made for sharing, and fantastic) and the lamb sausage (incredible flavor). For those who complain about the noise level, yes, it's loud in there. But you need to consider the concept of the restaurant- it's not supposed to be a quiet, intimate place. The communal seating punctuates that idea well. It's a place to kick back, have some delicious beer and even better food and maybe meet a few new people.

It featured a five course dinner focused on ingredients from the Michigan harvest, and paired with six beers from New Holland. It was an amazing experience.

I spent a few days prior to my arrival perusing the menu. I had my heart set firmly on the Suckling Pig. You can't go wrong with a little baby piglet. Yum. I also had a chance to check out Publican's stellar beer selection. Saison Dupont? \"Holy Santa Claus shit,\" I said. My wife was not particularly excited, especially after I explained to her exactly what a suckling pig was, very specifically I might add. She seemed negatively focused on the intense amount of meat on the menu, despite a dedicated section titled \"Vegetable.\" I offered to order for her, which she accepted. Upon arrival at the restaurant, I noticed that the sucking pig was no longer on the menu. I was pretty bummed until I saw the words \"Pork Belly\" in it's place. Pork belly? Yes, please. The country ribs seemed a perfectly safe order for my wife, so I didn't spend a lot of time reviewing more of the menu. As we sat observing our surroundings and waiting on the first round of beer, we noticed the oysters coming by our table frequently. We ended up ordering the kumamoto, which were fantastic. My pork belly was flawless. I have zero complaints. \u00a0The explosion of flavor left me mostly speechless. My wife's country ribs were flavorful, tender, moist and juicy; at least the first one was. Later after I'd inhaled my pork belly, I had another off her plate and found it considerably drier than the first. There are a couple of things I don't like about Publican. First, I don't like family style dining. I'm too selfish with my food to want to watch someone else eat what I've chosen, only to fill my hunger void with whatever crap they order. Second, I don't dig the seating arrangement. It's beautiful inside to be sure, but what's up with the pigpen booths? I'm not normally a claustrophobic person, but I did NOT like being boxed in like that at all. You can't sit with the booth doors open, so if you're not into it, your other choice is to sit in the goofy square community-style seating area. Here you get to sit right next to people that you don't know. Fun! Not. The food and beer more than made up for the uncomfortable seating, however.The other couple we dined with had warned us about reported complaints of small portions and being left hungry. These complaints must be setting in with the restaurant because our server was very clear about how the menu is laid out by portion size, from smallest to largest as you work your way down.

We had this last time we came for brunch, and it pleased then, too -- tart, beautiful poached eggs on great sourdough accompanied by arugula and prosciutto of the most perfect age. Liane's dish, however, took the table by storm. The dirtiest rice provided a bed for outstanding shrimp (and I, let it be known, detest shrimp). It was great.One wee complaint must be mentioned -- the tea. Liane ordered a barrel-aged pu-erh that, when served, was a pinch of tea leaves that barely colored the water in the pot. I had a similar problem with my samurai chai, though the peppercorny punch still came through. Have I been using toomany tea leaves all this time, or was the teatrayer too stingy?Since a lackluster brunch at Nightwood made me question its position as Best Sunday Brunch in Chicago, I've been on the lookout for a new place to bid farewell to the weekend.

Both were phenomenal. For brunch, I had the red wine poached eggs with la quercia prociutto, sourdough and bearnaise. Delicious. How could you go wrong?I loved the brunch but the experience I had here at dinner was by far the most impressive. I recommend going with a group of at least 5 people and sharing a bunch of plates so you have a chance to try many of the delectable dishes on the meat-heavy menu. We started with the Taste of Three Hams which includes:- Serrano, a rich and wild ham- La Quercia Rossa, mild and smooth- Benton Country Ham , smoky and sweetYou can't fully enjoy the Publican unless you indulge in their pork products, as you might guess from the giant paintings of pigs that adorn this spacious, design-conscious restaurant. I hear that the oysters are wonderful too but we tried the fish & chips and the sand dabs. The fish and chips were perfect, flaky and moist. The sand dabs were excellent as well, almost buttery in the way that they melt in your mouth. Everything I've ever had from the Slagel Family Farm is delectable and the Sirloin Steak at the Publican is no exception. You'll want to savor each bite of this flavorful cut of meat and the avocado/beet side dish compliments its flavors perfectly. The farm chicken with summer sausage and frites will not disappoint as it is ridiculously tender and moist in the way that good chicken should be. The crispy frites soak up the flavorful chicken juices! You'll probably make inappropriate noises and you definitely won't want to stop eating them. I have two final words of wisdom for you: PORK BELLY. The maple glaze gives it a perfect sweet crispness on the outside and the inside is pure juicy, mouthwatering pork goodness. Trust me, it's everything you want it to be. By the end of the meal I was in the happiest meat coma I've experienced in a while and I'm already planning a trip back. Grab some friends and JUST GO.

My wife and I came here to celebrate our 6 month wedding anniversary... which was really just used as an excuse to check this place out, nobody in their right mind should celebrate 6 months out of \"forever\"... and that was our first mistake, coming here with only 2 people. The portions are smaller, yet cost the same as a full meal at other places, so when it's just 2 people, it's hard to try multiple dishes without spending a fortune. I suggest coming with 4 people so you can try more than just a couple plates while keeping the price down. We still ended up trying 4 different things: the aged ham sampler, the sweet potatoes, the fries with egg and the scallops. I'm not a scallops guy, the consistency makes me gag, but my wife loved them. The fries were just french fries with an over-easy egg on top... can't go wrong here. The ham sampler was delicious and the sweet potatoes were amazing. Obviously I can't argue that the food is good, but for what you get and what it costs, I really don't think I'd ever come back here. And aside from that, this place is known for it's pork products, or so I was lead to believe, yet I didn't see any bacon on the menu at all? Was I mislead in thinking it was a pork place? It was a little disappointing, but I got over it. The other thing that is a little strange, but not too bad, is the communal seating. Since we were a group of 2, we were sat at a super long table that looked like it was straight out of Game of Thrones, between a group of 5 and a group of 4. The group of 5 was in town for business and having a great time. They were super friendly, telling us all about the dishes they got, recommending stuff, and just generally being friendly people. The group of 4 was a younger married couple and one of their parents. The father in the group saw me take out my cell phone one time for about 10 seconds as my wife was doing the same. It was the only time we took our phones out the whole meal (we like to \"Check-In\" on Foursquare to see if there are deals), yet the old man would constantly ask us if we were texting each other... the whole meal. We never took our phones out again, but he continued to ask whether or not we were going to text each other... He seemed like a nice guy, but it was extremely annoying. So just beware that a crotchety old man who doesn't understand technology, or assumes that because you have your phone out for 10 seconds that you can't sit and talk to your wife, could be sitting next to you possibly ruining your meal. It's a hazard of the communal seating. On the other hand, you could get a group of awesome people sitting next to you which could make your evening that much better.", "Date": "2012-11-29", "Author_Location": "Evanston, IL"}, {"Author": "B K.", "ReviewID": "PwAjyEAzS33Gf4iF75_ofw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cannot say enough good things about this place! \u00a0Healthy? \u00a0No. \u00a0Delicious? \u00a0Yes! \u00a0And the beer list...?! \u00a0I cannot even give it credit! \u00a0You need a place to go to get great food and drinks, come to here!", "Date": "2013-07-08", "Author_Location": "Northbrook, IL"}, {"Author": "Dirk S.", "ReviewID": "wxJbO-CcSmcog6tMjxFiCg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this place.

Our waiter was also very helpful with suggestions for both beer and food, even though he suggested to order wayyyy more dishes than we could actually consume.Cons:- We had made a reservation for 4 and our 4th was running late (and eventually couldn't make it). They wouldn't seat us until our 4th showed, and when we realized he wasn't coming, they gave away our table under a BS guise that the group \"had had this reservation for like, 3 weeks.\" Okay, Hostess Lady, I don't believe you, but that isn't going to seat me sooner so I'll smile and play nice. Just note that they won't seat you until your full party has shown up.- It was loud, but I suppose that's part of the charm. This was originally supposed to be a working dinner, but since we put the laptops away, it wasn't too terrible.- The food came out extremely rapid-fire, which was nice because it was all fresh and hot, but hard to manage everything coming out so quickly!And now, the most important part -- the beer/food!To start, I asked our waiter for a beer suggestion -- my favorite are Hefeweizens/lighter beers, to which he immediately suggested the Weihenstephaner Vitus.. He said it with such convinction that I had to order it, and I'm glad I did. Spot on. It was so good, I think I may have a new favorite!Anyways, since we were hungry, we started laundry-listing pretty much anything we even sort-of thought looked good.. and our waiter even suggested we should order more than we listed. I think we went with about 8-10 dishes in total.Here were some of my favorites:Tomato salad - overall, my favorite dish of the night. I know, I was faced with some ridiculously amazing stuff, but I really really REALLY enjoyed this salad. I wasn't too sure of it because um, who puts tomato, watermelon, yogurt and dill together on a plate?! But it all worked so nicely and was very light and refreshing.Smoked salmon on toast - Came with some sort of dipping sauce that was absolutely delicious. Mussels - pretty standard as compared to other steamed mussels in broth, but the bread that was served with it was actually really good. Super crusty and warm - yummy and perfect for zope'ing!We also got fries (which I didn't care for, but another in my party liked them a lot so I guess it's a matter of taste), flank steak (cooked perfectly.. very raw/still moo'ing.. happy happy), and snapper over lime beans and roasted red peppers.. it was all so delicious, but needless to say, it was a lot of food, and after we finished all of that we realized that we had ordered about 3 MORE plates.. to which we told our waiter enough! .. Where is the dessert menu??? :)For dessert, we got a cup of the sour cherry sorbet (good, but a little too sour) and the waffle with salted cashews and ice cream.

We were asked to pick several plates, which were then ordered into loose courses for us by our waiter.2) We started with a sort of charcuterie of pig - \"taste of three hams\", with \"peasant bread\" and \"goat butter\". The goat butter tasted...like butter, shockingly, and the bread was fine. The pig, though, was excellent. Thinly sliced and each of the three types of pig had very distinctive tastes, to the point where I loved two and hated one for being too smoky.3) We also shared frites with two eggs, frites just on their own with a side of aioli, and a cone of pork rinds. The frites with two eggs were quite good, but the eggs actually got in the way of the perfection of the fries themselves -- somehow managing to be super-crisp on the outside but soft and moist on the inside, well-seasoned but not overbearing, and not really needing the aioli either. In and of themselves, they showed what a potato can do and I could quite seriously have an entire meal of these little miracles.The pork rinds were just too odd for me to appreciate them. I'm sure that, for pork rinds, they are quite good, and I got a couple bites in where the paprika and other seasonings were blended deliciously, but the pork rinds themselves?Imagine breathing in a mist. Made of ham.It's just too strange.4) Also ordered: \"little gem salad\" with a decadent buttermilk and basil vinaigrette and \"head cheese croutons\". If you are saying \"what the what?\" to the concept of croutons made of head cheese, you are not alone. However, what they turned out to be were deep fried X, where X is anything you've ever had deep-fried ever. It tasted good. What can I say?5) One of the smaller dishes we shared was sturgeon: fish, with bacon on top, some creme fraiche and a lot of dill. It was SO good. I only had a bite, because coming were: a giant bowl of mussels, which were floating in a broth of the essence of savory. The mussels came with a little rhomboid prism of bread, and dipping it in that broth was one of the highlights of the night. The mussels themselves were quite good, too, but that broth!6) For the piece de la resistance: sirloin beef tips, cooked medium rare, and sliced in such a way as everyone could get their fill. They were delicious and beefy, but they were, you know, cow. I've had it before. It wasn't prepared in any way that made it more special for me. It was delicious, but there's not much more to say about that.Having filled ourselves to the brim on everything else, we had no room for dessert. Still and all, a very, very nice night, and for much less than I'd expected.", "Date": "2011-03-14", "Author_Location": "Happy Valley, OR"}, {"Author": "Troy M.", "ReviewID": "ORUc_rC8vgO6lqVPJLLChQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Absolute best Sunday Brunch in chicagoJust amazing food and great staff.", "Date": "2011-04-19", "Author_Location": "Arlington Heights, IL"}, {"Author": "Lisa P.", "ReviewID": "HRNpkrJ7gYn_SyijzRl45Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think I misordered but I would definitely go back.

First, it was so hot in the restaurant that I couldn't get comfortable. We asked our waiter, the hostess and other servers who came to our table to turn down the heat or turn on the air conditioning. It was so bad that my boyfriend actually got up from the table to go stand outside to cool off. I think the heat wouldn't have been as bad if the seating situation was different as well. We were a party of four sitting in the middle of one of the long tables in the middle. So I felt squished next to strangers, people were standing behind me at the high top bar tables, and I was sweating because it was so hot. \u00a0The communal tables are fun, but not when you feel like you can't get any air. Now for the food. I ordered some oysters and they were excellent. I also had the mussels and they were divine. The broth was buttery and light and was delicious with the fresh bread. We also waited for 25 minutes after my reservation so the restaurant gave us complimentary pork rinds and French fries. \u00a0That was a nice touch. The French fries were ok, the pork rinds had too much dry cheese on them. Great texture and perfectly \u00a0crunchy. We also ordered the three types of ham to try. It was delicious. The blood sausage was too far out there for us. Our waiter suggested it, but I could only eat a few bites. The scallops were very good, the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. We also ordered the suckling pig, this was the best dish by far. The potee was ok, a little salty and I didn't care for the one cut of the meat. We ordered the chocolate cake and coconut sorbet for dessert. They were ok. We really enjoyed the New Zealand Pinot noir. It was light and was a great pairing for both meat and fish.

My dad had a lamb dish I had a bite of and my tongue did a backflip, it was the best thing that hit our table and whatever I was having paled in comparison. One in our party ordered the half chicken and it was pretty average with an above average price. The chareuterie plate was pretty good, and the spicy pork rinds that everyone raves about were nice but I hate to say it I get more enjoyment (and value) from the spicy pork rinds I grab from 7-11.

I ended up going with the red wine poached eggs, sourdough and bernaise, served with la quercia prosciutto and a lightly dressed baby arugula salad. The riff on a mundane eggs benedict was something special, and the slight acidity from the red wine actually worked and made the dish surprisingly light. The bf ordered the pork belly bibimbap with kimchi, brown rice and a fried egg which he really seemed to enjoy. Our friend went the sweet route with the beautiful looking waffles with an apple-plum jam and honey butter that totally made me green with envy. I only wish that I could have stolen a bite from his plate, if only he didn't possess such a big appetite. To accompany our entrees, we also ordered the obligatory maple braised publican bacon, hashbrowns, and sausage on the side. The thick slabs of bacon were certainly everything everyone makes them out to be - buttery, sweet and salty - a perfect symphony of flavors. Besides the great food, I also really dig The Publican for their emphasis on craft beers and unique brunch cocktails. Bloody marys here are not your average run of the mill stuff made with some store bought mix, but tangy and pungent with grated horseradish and a ton of pickled veggie garnishes. Now the kicker on those badboys is the beer served alongside the bloody marys, and my Zombie Dust was perfectly hoppy and bright. Who would've thought that beer would go so well with a bloody mary! The bf's publican mimosa, made with a Belgium Blanche and freshly squeezed OJ was great as well, a little \"manlier\" than the average mimosa I suppose. The Publican really represents what I've come to love about the Chicago food scene; the casual yet totally exciting cuisine in a genuinely fun, unpretentious environment is something NYC still lacks. The Publican was a much needed breath of fresh air for me, and probably tops the majority of my extensive brunch experiences in NYC at this point.", "Date": "2012-09-05", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Dan G.", "ReviewID": "wH52GB4vimkENt_xFrWHjg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Woo pig sooie! What a feast. Publican has it all covered. I can't believe it has taken me this long to get to this West Loop gem. This place kind of reminds me of a cross between comfort food and a beer hall. There are a bunch of long wooden tables for communal dining and some two tops surrounding them. There are also a few pig pen type tables with barn doors that looked cute. Huge pictures of large swines are all around, just in case you didn't notice what they specialize in here. If you are a less adventurous diner or on a diet, this may not be the place for you. Located right in the heart of the meat packing district, you can get practically anything you'd like here. It seems like they serve it all, from the rooter to the tooter. Heart, sweetbreads, rabbit, pork rinds, charcuterie and foie gras are all here for you. Plenty of options for fish or veggies, if you don't feel like satisfying your inner carnivore. Pony up and let's strap on the feedbag, shall we? This menu is perfect for sharing, so you may want to go with a group. It was a bit tough for us to navigate our way through the menu as it is more tapas style and nothing seemed clearly appetizer or entree. We started with the beet salad and burrata. This was an excellent start. The yellow beets were really tasty and nicely paired with the creamy burrata. We also had the pretzel with Bavarian mustard that reminded me of those enormous ones that we wolfed down over many beers at the Hofbrauhaus. My wife had the sea bass as her main. I had the half hog they call the \"Ham chop in hay\". When this platter of swine hit the table, I felt like calling over other diners for back up. This gigantic portion must have had about a dozen chops and ribs. It wasn't until I had worked my way through a few of them that I made it to the flavorful grits and ramps underneath. This dish was a winner and I'm pleased to report that I put away most of it. I wanted to save room for dessert and I'm glad that I did. Double chocolate cake with bourbon county stout caramel, bananas and coffee ice cream. That satisfied a chocolate fix very nicely and the french press coffee was great too. I did say it reminded me of a beer hall didn't I? Hearty Belguims and Germans are on tap and if you can't find something to your liking there are a few dozen bottled global options. I really liked the Weissbier they had on tap and we had a couple of rounds of it. Sadly, the service was a bit off. We were there early because we had a show to catch later in the evening. Although I discussed our situation with our server, he just couldn't keep us on schedule and we waited a good hour between courses. Dinner menus had not been printed when we were seated. Wrong dishes and drinks were constantly arriving at our table. Food arrived before we even had our first round. Overall I really did like Publican. Paul Kahan's trifecta of culinary excellence has reinforced my rather biased belief that my West Loop home is the city's best restaurant area. I'm looking forward to returning for brunch or maybe just a few rounds.

I'm now going to tell you about some points of interest about the Publican. By now you all know that this place is pretty much one big shine to the swine so I'm going to go with a little more off-the-beaten track type stuff.1. They have the best Limoncello you've ever had. It takes like the Ferrara Pan Lemonhead blew a load right into your mouth. Way creamier and less acidic than normal Limoncello. Yes, this will probably get flagged but I'm rebel, Dottie. 2. When they have the Kusshi oysters on the menu - GET THEM. They are so tiny, adorable and fresh that you'll feel just like you're the Walrus in \u00a0Disney's Alice in Wonderland and you have no remorse eating these precious, anthropomorphic little bites. youtube.com/watch?v=Nql1\u20263. They have one of the best bathrooms in the city. Each toilet has it's own little room complete with tchotchke in a glass cabinet for your viewing pleasure. The sink is a giant communal fountain deal with plenty of C.O. Bigelow's Lime and Coriander soap and lotion. And they have Dyson Air Blade hand dryers which could alone add a star to a review of any establishment. 4. You can buy a sixer of beer for the hard working people in the kitchen and they'll ring a bell to celebrate your generosity.5. Every time I go to the bathroom (which is frequently because I swill a lot of beer) I am running an experiment to see if the staff will pick my napkin up off the chair, un-rumple it and neatly fold it on the table. They have not once forgotten to do this. \u00a0I had no clue that was a point of service until I started coming here!6. You can get one of the best hot dogs you've ever had each day from 3:30pm - 5:30pm!So that's it.

We lucked in to a reservation on Opentable.com for our reservation. May I suggest if you are going to eat, get a reservation. Don't quibble, don't give me a snarky quip at this suggestion. A seat at the bar is hard, sitting down for dinner can be harder. When I got in, the woman quoted the couple an hour to an hour and a half. Sucks to be them.Since one of our manly mates couldn't make it due to an emergency, a client of mine stepped in to take our place. She did a flawless job as we dove in to the fresh oysters on the half shell, three different kinds and all quite good. We did find the larger ones to be a little more packed full of flavor and yet all of them went down so well. \u00a0The pork rinds were good, but the flavoring on them made me feel like I was eating something too processed and not anything more natural. If anything perhaps a dip of chimichurri might have made for a more interesting treat. Still not bad. The sweet breads were delicious and wonderful. Not gamey at all, but tender and filled with subtle flavor. The pork belly was the winner of the night, though I might suggest two if you like it. Or if you are like me, make sure to get one order for yourself. (well.... I will next time) The ham platter was good, though I think next time I might get all three, just for the comparison factor. The bolito misto, with it's trio of pork shoulder, sausage and chicken all roasted together in a deliciousness of triocitiness with roasted veggies... oh wait. Yes. We did have veggies. Though the frites were just meh and not all too exciting, the pickled selection was good and the cauliflower gratin was phenom. But when you pair ham and gruyere, any veggie can be good. The beer selection is amazing, but really, let's not forget about the wine. A lot of selection and many at a very reasonable price. I will say the food and time that was had by all, was a fun and a really great night and will be the reason why I will return. Our server was swamped and in the weeds most of the night, so I can't say our service was great. The place is loud and bright, so if you want a date place or a place to have a quiet night, yeah... you might want to move to the sister The Violet Hour instead.

Alpha King and the Brauerei Spezial Spezial Rauchbier Lager. \u00a0I liked both the paler ale and the smoked lager. \u00a0The Bloody Mary was also remarkably affordable - depending on the beer, it cost either $7 or $9.Excellent as it was, The Publican's Bloody Mary did not make the meal alone - the food brought me to sacrilegious exclamation and murmuring disbelief. \u00a0The spicy pork rinds came first, a cone filled with large crunchy pork rinds speckled in red piquant spices. \u00a0The rinds were the perfect beer food, porky but light, and easy to snack on. \u00a0Then came the main dishes, with a couple sides of hash browns. \u00a0The red wine poached eggs were some of the best eggs I've had in the last few years. \u00a0They were perfectly cooked, with yolks that held for just a second before they ran, slowly, across the plate. \u00a0The whites were soft but solid, tinged with purple and laced through with a gentle red wine flavor. \u00a0These were served with a dreamy rich b\u00e9arnaise over sourdough bread, with La Quercia prosciutto and a lightly dressed salad of arugula and thin sliced red onion. \u00a0A cut of half-soaked toast, poached egg, yolk-thickened b\u00e9arnaise, with a silky strip of prosciutto and a little bit of green - a perfect bite, if that is what you're looking for. \u00a0My other favorite dish was the bucatini alla carbonara with pork belly, egg, and parmesan. \u00a0We ordered one of these for the table, with the idea that it sounded good and a few bites of pasta would be nice with our brunchier dishes. \u00a0It almost stole the show. \u00a0The hollow pasta was a pinpoint al dente, with such a wonderful bite we had to wonder why there wasn't more pasta on the menu. \u00a0The chunks of pork belly were tender and pleasantly salt, and the egg made a light sauce that needed only pepper and parmesan to sing out.Everything we had was delicious. \u00a0Though the poached eggs and bucatini were my favorites, there were no misses. \u00a0The maple-glazed pork shoulder was fork tender, lean but not dry, with a great jerky flavor that did well with the maple glaze. \u00a0It was served with a sunny side up egg, kale, grits, and pickled red onions. \u00a0I loved everything but the grits, which would have been better with a creamier texture. \u00a0The duck confit hash was another great dish, with lovely shreds of duck with cabbage, white beans, parmesan potatoes, and two sunny side up eggs. \u00a0Finally there was the farmhouse cheddar biscuit with sausage patty, fried egg, spiced creme fraiche, and a citrus salad. \u00a0This was the least memorable of the dishes, but it was tasty in its own right. \u00a0Last, I cannot forget the cheesy, crispy hash browns, which we ordered for the table. \u00a0We quickly demolished our first plate and ordered another. \u00a0Don't miss these.I understand that The Publican serves many meals a week, and that only one is brunch. \u00a0One day, I hope to come back for dinner, but not before I have brunch again. \u00a0The food was outstanding, crowned by a Bloody Mary worth talking about. \u00a0When I think of Chicago, I will always reminisce about The Publican.", "Date": "2012-01-28", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "alicia e.", "ReviewID": "HbQ3oyFy7_ev8vtpfoD9Jw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Dear Publican Hostesses on the night of 6/23 (one of you is named Sarah, I know that much),In our long tenure (our = fiance and me) in the food service industry, we have never EVER been told when the next booking was so that we could get out \"in time.\" \u00a0We've worked at upscale restaurants. \u00a0We know how to cultivate a feeling of warm exclusivity. \u00a0It would behoove both of you snots to learn.Perhaps 24 hours in advance isn't enough notice to alert you that a member of our 7 top wouldn't be coming. \u00a0However, it was the time frame I was given on the phone by a much more polite woman a week earlier when I first made the reservation. \u00a0Perhaps it's because we were 10 minutes late, although calling you 1/2 hour beforehand seemed like it would mitigate the piss poor attitude we got. \u00a0You assured me that everything was fine. \u00a0I don't know what happened really, except that we showed up, you looked me square cold in the eye and breezily uttered \"The next seating is at 8:30. \u00a0Your party should have *plenty* of time before giving up the table.\" \u00a0Screw you. \u00a0Even in the lowest ice cream stores in the Midwestern burbs, employees are fired for comments that boil down to \"hurry up and get out.\" \u00a0Yet there you are like the Queen of Siam or some shit working upscale. \u00a0A-frikin'-mazing.Since future-hubby loves pork so much and I have a massive hard-on for oysters, Publican hasn't been totally written off our list. \u00a0If nothing else, we're kinda sad about the whole thing. \u00a0Everything else is so lovely there, although I did notice a distinctly more...hipster look to the wait staff, which rarely bodes well for attitude adjustments. \u00a0However, it may be time to start playing the field for other candidates a bit. \u00a0Just letting you know, so you can, like, get out in time.Ciao,AP.S. \u00a0Please tell your ancillary waitstaff to not be so quick about clearing glasses with scotch in them. \u00a0That's been stuck in the Man's craw a bit too.", "Date": "2011-06-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Brian K.", "ReviewID": "rzI9IP2On_JYoEVpWDXvfg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FAMOUS FOR (My rating in paren)- Oysters (Chef Selection) 6/10- Spicy Pork Rinds (9/10)- Pork Belly (6/10)- Ham Chop (5/10)I ALSO TRIED- Porkette (11/10)A group of friends and I used to visit a hype-filled restaurant every month, but about a year ago, it sort of fizzled, but thank God, it's starting again! We had our re-joining event at The Publican for October, and I brought along with me about a year's worth of pent up anxiety to eat Chicago's best, and a whole platter of hype! What's different about the hype this time, though, is that instead of a thousand people telling me how great this place was, it was really only 1-2 people telling me how phenomenally spectacular this place was. There was no end to their raves (it was like me being the only person to tell you how life-changing 554 is)! So, when it was announced that we're going to The Publican, I was in a wreck just waiting to go!SPICY PORK RINDSI HATE pork rinds! I knew like 2 people in my entire life that actually liked pork rinds, and on maybe 10 different occasions, I bought pork rinds at the store, had one, spit it out, and then cursed those friends! BUT, considering that there's a huge amount of hype of Publican's pork rinds, we ordered 'em (and plus it's $5, you can't lose)! I took a bite and instantly, I knew it was different. It was crispy and airy, instead of just dense. The taste was pretty good (more on that later), but it finished well, which is where normal pork rinds suck. You get a very small bit of that skin feeling, but it's really minimal and it dissolves fast enough where it doesn't detract from the experience. So all in all, texture wise, it feels like a little less crispy prawn chip (Asian snack) with a minimal pork-rindish skin finish. Taste? Well, it's nice 'n' mild. It has a very mild mild hint of pork flavor (like a pork chop) on the chip itself. There's like mini cheese crumble looking things sprinkled all over. It wasn't salty, but just enough to satisfy, and it's not a \"salt\" salty, but like a cheese-salty. At the first chip, after being relieved it wasn't like your normal pork rind, I didn't think it was really all that. But as I had more, it got really addicting! By the end, I was thinking, it'd be awesome if they had like little 8'x8' huts all over the city that just sold Publican pork rinds! OYSTERSI like oysters, but I'm no connoisseur. I like them with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and Tabasco. These come with a vinegar cup thing, and it was ok, but I just wished for my normal sauce concoction. I had the Chef Selection, and honestly, they all tasted the same. But seriously, don't take my word for it!PORK BELLY & HAM CHOPThese are separate dishes, but pretty similar. Pork Belly tasted like very tender ham. Ham chop is like a very thick (1-1.5\") slice of Honey Baked Ham! Honestly, I thought both of them tasted a little better than Honey Baked Ham, but the difference was that the texture was really good on both of these. I've never had such a thick piece of ham like the Ham Chop, but it was moist and tender. Texture aside, it was just ham.PORKETTEI don't know how we ended up getting this. It's NOT on the menu, and the waitress said it's seasonal (later parts of the year). This is the last thing that came out for us, and I have to say, up to this point, I was very disappointed with The Publican. The only thing that delivered was the $5 pork rinds! The rest of it, I wouldn't know if you replaced my free Christmas meat with Publican's. But then, this unassuming plate came out...Simply put, it's a gigantic pork chop. It's about 1-1.5\" thick, and 1/3 of it is just fat! But let me tell you, when I took a bite of this, my eyes opened really wide (and I'm Korean so that's a big deal!) and I sort of forgot where I was and what I was eating for the past hour. That little bite that I took was consuming my whole mind! Now, I have to tell you, you don't need to eat a lot of it, but you do need a small portion of the fat with each bite. Without it, you miss out on a lot of the pork flavor. But having said that, oh my GOD! First, the texture, this is the most moist piece of pork I've ever had in my entire life! I mean, we're talking about an inch cube and it chews easy, goes down easy, and even though you're eating a little fat, your mouth doesn't feel like Crisco! I've also never tasted such an incredible pork flavor either! Pork flavor is kind of a fine line. You either have none (so it's just the other white meat) and sometimes you have a little too much where it's got the odor and isn't appetizing. But this was just perfect and right on. Every bite was just buttery goodness! My vocabulary is too small to do this justice! Again, we went in the end of October, so I don't know when exactly this becomes available, but that's when you need to go!**Would I come back? Absolutely!

It's THAT good.This place is absolutely focused on food. That might seem like a obvious statement, considering that it's a restaurant, thank you, but I am serious. No contrived atmosphere. No overwrought plating or presentations. No distractions. Just simple globe lighting over dark and sturdy community tables within a large open space in an inconvenient warehouse-district location. Paintings of enormous English swine are the only decor (hanging over the \"pig pens\"...more on those later.) Energetic crowd, filled with people who are genuinely thrilled to have gotten a reservation here...What they serve at The Publican are flawlessly-prepared, authentic rustic dishes of pork and seafood.

The beer list is also top notch, another highlight of the Publican, with a cool selection of little-known artisan beers from all over the globe. THE PIG PENS: If you've got a party of 4, you might get seated in the \"pig pens\", where you get boxed in behind these wooden half-doors. They're cool in the sense that they add a feeling of privacy in an otherwise crowded restaurant, but it comes with a price. I'm not sure if this started out as a misguided attempt to build empathy between you and your prospective meal, or a play at simulating a barnyard atmosphere in the Near West Side (at least, they spared us the hay and manure), but the reality is that these pig pens are a bit uncomfortable and impractical, especially for a bunch of really tall dudes. (Together, the guy sitting next to me and I combined for about 13 feet and 500 lbs of uncoordinated male splendor. When someone had to leave for the pissoir, it was like a clown car scene, with all the clowns stumbling drunk and tripping over each other to get out of the little car.) In the end, it didn't matter.

On our last visit, we were so excited for the amazing beer selection, both reasonably priced and pieced out in to sections of your liking. Definitely a plus in my book. That is still the same, thankfully. Still good beer at great prices if you don't want to get too heavy. Our service was also wonderful and we were seated in non communal seating-much appreciated since it was the beau's birthday and I was treating :)On our visit this time, we were again sat at a two-top by the window. +1 I think if you book through Open Table, they are less likely to see you communally, but don't quote me on that.Here is what we ordered and you'll see why I'm only awarding them 3 stars this time around. I'll start with the best...going down to the not so great...1. Hopslam on draft for $5. Amazing! Coming in at 10%, this alcohol will leave you buzzed but not full, and the aroma is perfectly light and not too sweet.2. The bread--ok, yea, I said it. The side of bread they give you and the bread accompanying the mussels was fantastic. Rustic, perfectly sliced, and baked. No super seasoning of any sort; it was perfect just being bread. 3. Grilled Country Rib- full size at $23. Probably the only things besides the beer that was worth the $$. It was so tender, and with the cheese sprinkled on the plate, I loved it even more. There was some fat I spit out, but you'll have that...4. Shaved Brussel sprouts (side) Wonderful, nothing to complain about here but it does look like they come at a hefty price $12--really?? We didn't even pay that much for BS in NYC. I digress...they were good.5. Mussels half order at $15. Again, a little bit of a hefty price for half mussels, BUT, the portion they give you is pretty generous. The bread, like I said, was fabulous but there was WAY more of it than there was broth. It was like Costco sized bread. The broth for the mussels was one of the best I've EVER had. That being said, there was barely ANY of it and with our copious amounts of yeast, there was barely anything to soak up. Also, the mussels were dry, small, and didn't seem to have any seasoning on them. Bummer!6. 1/2 Charcuterie plate. $15. Wasn't my favorite of all C-plates in the city but there was an awesome sausage link on there that I could have had plenty more of on ma plate.7. Dessert- Chocolate Waffle Ice cream. Sounds amazing, right?! Wrong. There was virtually no, I mean NO chocolate on there, with a few sprinkled pistachios and a tiny ass amount of ice cream that did not taste like cinnamon at all. There was some powdered sugar though...At $8, I was anticipating some dripping chocolate in my mouth. Nope.I was expecting to say more about Publican this time than, \"the bread was SOOO yummy\", but really, that was kind of my feeling.

The place, surprisingly, wasn't packed but it was an earlier reservation of 5:30pm but also works for us, since we could actually have a decent conversation without having to yell. The atmosphere is very cool and love all the lights in the place, and it's still dim and warm feeling inside. Our server was very chill, not one to kiss our butts, but more of a direct and straight forward which is what we like in a server. She didn't really recommend much, but she was there to answer any or all of our questions. We started with the spicy pork rinds because I saw them on that food network channel and they were a little weird tasting so we definitely wouldn't get them again. Next came the pommes frites served with a garlic alioli sauce and they were delicious, but they gave you enough for like 4 people so we couldn't even finish them. Then came the most amazing and must order item on the menu, the taste of three hams with pheasant bread and goat butter. Wow, the country ham from Tennessee was my absolute favorite of the three, it was just melt in your mouth amazing and that goat butter, I can just eat it by the spoonful. I'm still craving that platter which was more than enough for us two and for $21 it was definitely worth the price. Next we got the chicken liver pate served with warm toast and grapes, it was a little different and not really my thing, but it was my husband's favorite item that night so I guess you should try it. It was a little too savory in my opinion, I prefer a little lighter pate. And of course, how could we pass on dessert even though we were already super full. We got the waffle with honey butter and apricot preserves and it was as delicious as everyone says, not as good as the Belgium waffles I had in Brussels definitely Publican worthy. Overall, excellent service, great and unique food, fun atmosphere for a date or group night AND get the Ham.

However, eventually the set dinner made some people back out, and I was left struggling without the ability to complete my Paul Kahan 'hat trick', (I had gone to Avec and Blackbird over the course of the past 18 months during trips back here). Again, perhaps foolishly, (and due to the relatively short trip), I had planned to make Thursday a day to visit the Field Museum and walk around downtown. My girlfriend made the trip with me, and she had been to Chicago only once before - this summer, for the two hottest days of the year! And here we were walking around on the coldest day yet this winter (although I suppose there were colder days last January of February). While at the museum, I realized that we might as well go to The Publican ourselves, so I used the opentable app on my information phone to make a reservation for an early dinner. Well, it turns out that that step was a bit superfluous, as at the beginning of dinner service - 5:30pm - the restaurant was rather desolate. So, if you can go early, do so!The restaurant itself is a whimsical interpretation of a Public house. Visually I really dug the wooden pillars which passed through oversized cutouts in the ceiling and the high ladderback chairs. \u00a0The chairs might look great, but they are not the most comfortable of chairs. The 4 top enclosed booths were also very engaging and interesting, and ditto for the large pig paintings.Back to the fact of our getting there around 5:30PM. We actually got there at 5:15, because it was cold out - I mentioned that, right? Once the sun went down, our desire to spend more than a scant few seconds outside waned, and so we hailed a cab and headed to the restaurant. \u00a0Of course we were quickly seated, but the dinner menu wasn't yet printed. We were given the afternoon bar menu to consider (and it turns out we did order something off it, but that's a story for later in the review), but we only ended up ordering drinks before the dinner menu was provided.As to drinks, they have a fantastically comprehensive beer menu; a wine list that I'm sure is equally as comprehensive, but I didn't consider it; and a full bar. Except the bar is not populated with the brands of spirits one would expect. Instead of a Ketel One Gimlet, one can get a gimlet made with Death's Door Vodka, from Door County, WI (there was also a small Texas brand to choose from). This is actually a good deal, because the Death's Door vodka is good stuff!After perusing the dinner menu, we were a bit overwhelmed, so we asked the server for suggestions. She told us that the Ham Selection was a very popular item - a serving of all three aged hams on their menu, two from Europe, and one from Virginia in this case. I saw this on the afternoon menu and it intrigued me, but her recommendation firmly sold us on it. She also recommended a number of other dishes (including Dungeness crab, but considering I live in San Francisco, it didn't sound as exotic to me as I think it did to her). We chose two of the suggested dishes as our mains, a scallop and mushroom dish and the potee, which is one of their signature meat dishes - three types of pork, cabbage, and gerkins served with a mustard sauce. Our server asked if we intended to share the items, to which we responded \"of course!\", and she suggested we take them in courses, a fish course and a main course. That was a fantastic idea. We rounded out our food selection with the daily pickly, which consisted of some bread and butter pickles that I actually liked, pickled cauliflower and the breakout hit of 2009, pickled celery root. The meal itself was quite satisfying and delicious, but of course there was room for dessert. The dessert menu included their in house concoction, the After Pork Digestif - a cocktail of some herbal liqueurs and simple syrup which sounded intriguing but I sadly had to pass on. We ended up splitting the chocolate souffle cake, which was served with a lightly herbal ice cream, and a glass of port (I had to drive us back to my parents house in the suburbs, so I had to reign in the drinking).Overall, it was a really good experience. Nice setting, save for perhaps the chairs, impeccable service, and tasty, high quality food.

Once again I've tried one of the talked about hotpots, and left thinking \"that's it?\" That was my recent experience with The Publican. Don't get me wrong: the food was good, the service was good, the atmosphere was good, but, I expected to be blown away and gobsmacked by incredible everything. Frankly, it was just ok, no more, no less. We went on a Friday night and were greeted by 3 very lovely hostesses, who proceeded to seat us at a table for 2 about 3 steps from the host stand. Since it was freezing outside and right by the front door we asked if we could sit elsewhere, and they very kindly moved us to a big shared table. We don't mind the whole communal eating with strangers trend, but, be warned if you like your privacy. Luckily for us we got seated at the end of the table with a large family, and it was actually quite nice. They were a friendly group and a pleasure to dine with. Our waiter came by and explained the menu (shared plates at the top, larger dishes to the bottom) and pointed out some highlights (porchetta). We ordered drinks, and here's my first of only two minor complaints: the beer list. The beer list is hefty with numerous choices. There are Belgian selections, trappist selections, Belgian micro-brew selections, domestic selections..so many selections! So many UNIQUE selections, so I don't understand why there is no description of the beers? Most places with that type of beer list gives even a brief description of the taste, hoppiness, etc. Nada. I like trying new brews, but, it's hard to determine what I will/will not like if I don't know what I'm ordering. Enough of my beer rant. Our waiter did make good suggestions based on what we said we typically like. Second complaint: they charge a lot more for their beer than other places with similar, if not better, selections *cough*Hopleaf*cough*. We ordered the ham sampler platter which was, you know, good. 3 types of ham with goat butter and bread. Nothing wrong there, but nothing uhmaaaaazing, either. Then the pork rinds, which were good. They're pork rinds, been 'eatin 'em for years, but I guess now they're what, haute cuisine or the latest trend? These were okay, but, I didn't need the dusting of cheese powder; I like my cracklings with hot sauce. Whatever..they're pork rinds, they were good. We had oysters, again very good, and split the porchetta based on the recommendation of our waiter. It was, in a word, delicious, and I would love to eat my pork in that style and manner all the time. We got frites to go with it, and they were a nice compliment. We had zero room for desert, but I heard raves about the waffle. Overall? It was a nice dinner and we enjoyed it.

Being super close to our place, we decided to try it out. The Publican is located on Fulton so expect to find street parking or valet. The restaurant is dimly lit and huge murals of extra fat pigs hang throughout the restaurant. This time, we did make reservations and were seated right away in a communal long table similar to avec. This part was quite awkward. Sitting uncomfortably close to strangers. Sitting down first and bf taking the long walk to the other side of the table. Good thing our waitress was friendly and the place has an incredibly cool interior. Besides sitting at the communal tables, you can also sit at a table alongside the walls. But that is if you want to feel like you're closed off in a pig pen. Each table is closed off with a wooden door that traps you in with your other pig buddies creating a more private dining experience. Moving on to the food. We ordered a lot because we were hangry (hungry + angry), but you'll see that it wasn't really that much.We started off with the chef's selection of an oyster platter. I'm a fresh oyster whore so this was heaven to me. It also came with homemade crackers which was out of this world.Pork rinds sprinkled with cheese powder. I could've done without the cheese powder, but good nonetheless.Fries with eggs. The idea sounds so good, but it was so not. The fries were good. Like diner down the street good. The egg was good. Together, it just didn't mesh as well as I had hoped. It tasted like two separate dishes, one placed on top of the other. I really looked forward to yolk covered fries, but the fries overpowered the yolky taste.And then came the Boudin Blane. Sausage with cream cabbage and pomegranate. This was the highlight of the experience. Sausage was incredibly tasty and went extremely well with the creamy cabbage. Only complaint that the dish was extremely small.Suckling pig with some chickpeas underneath. This was very disappointing. They pride themselves in their pork dishes, yet this was very mediocre. It was a little dry. The crunchy skin was the best part.Still hungry from the small portions, we decided to order Chocolate Budino. It comes with a peanut buttle cookie, coffee gelato, and honey & cashew brittle. Best part was the gelato. The crunchy honey brittle was awesome, but chocolate budino was way too sweet and strong. Enjoy in small doses.Overall, there were ups and downs with the food. Oysters and Sausage were my favs. The others weren't necessarily bad, but definitely not memorable. Staff is nice and food came at a good pace. Expect to spend about $40 per person. I would give this a 3/5 star. Do I like this place?

This was the most dramatic looking of everything they brought out. \u00a0It had a nice pear salad and some bunches of raisons still on the vine, which looked great and were very tasty.The cremeaux dessert was very nice. \u00a0It was much thicker than I expected and the prunes were amazing.

To me, this place is quintessentially Chicago. It's social, revolves around meat and beer, and is totally unpretentious. They're always packed in here for a reason--the menu, although a bit on the pricey side, is inventive without being intimidating, the service is personable and informed, and the atmosphere is lively.

Finding The Publican can be tricky if you don't know where you're going. Its located in the West Loop in the Fulton Market area hidden next to factories and art galleries. There were six of us who went we had made a reservation so we had no problems getting seated. \u00a0I went there expecting The Publican to be kind of an upscale Hop Leaf. The Publican is not at all like Hop Leaf. Hop Leaf is a beer bar that happens to serve good food; The Publican is all about the food and just happens to have good beer.The atmosphere is rustic and noisy, you are seated at large communal tables with strangers sitting right next to you. I didn't mind the communal seating, it contributes to the whole dining experience. Once seated we began to look over the large beer menu. The menu is one large sheet of paper so much easier to read then the book Hop Leaf gives you. Most of the beers on the menu are belgian beers which can be confusing and difficult to figure out what to pick. As a result of that it makes it easy to go for the things you recognize like the Alpha King or Left Handed Milk Stout. But I was in the mindset of going out of my comfort zone so no matter how much I might of wanted a Goose Island Imperial IPA I wasn't going to do it. While looking over the menu I just needed to point out that our waitress was amazing and new a great deal about the beers on the menu. I finally picked the Witkap Pater Singel / Stimulo from Brouwerij Slaghmuylder. This was a great beer to start off the night with, refreshing and slightly sour and very drinkable. With first drinks out of the way the food started to pour in... we ordered a lot. Pork rinds, frites, sardines got us off to a decent start. The sardines were maybe my least favorite thing we ate that night but definitely weren't terrible. Next came out the duck heart, beef tongue, farm chicken, sea bass, and ribs. Hands down my favorite dish of the night was the duck heart. It is great that The Publican tries to use as many local farmers as they can for their meats and produce.With all this food coming out it was time for some more beer. Next up for me was the second beer in the abbey beers section, the Triple karmeliet by Brouwerij Bosteels. This was a great and complex beer, again a slight sour nose with orange and grass. A few more dishes of food came out and we chatted, ate and drank. Looking back I can't believe we almost didn't order a third beer but I'm so happy we did. For my last beer I decided to split the Aventinus Vintage 2003. This beer rocked and was maybe my favorite of the night. Over all it was an outstanding night at The Publican and I had a fabulous time eating and drinking some things I might of never tried. But in the end The Publican is really hyped up and I don't think it lives up to all the attention it gets. Sure it is great but the best meal I have ever had? I don't think I could say that. One of the most interesting meals, maybe. I could definitely see myself maybe stopping in for a drink and some pork rinds but I don't think I need to have a full meal.

Ok, so maybe I've only been here once, but everything was pretty CLOSE to perfect. we went here for an early dinner before heading to a concert. I had been wanting to try this place for months. Made a reservation through OpenTable the night before and got a table reserved that would give us time to eat, relax, and enjoy some beverages before heading out. We misjudged how long CTA would take us to get there, and ended up nearly 30 minutes early for our reservation. The hostess offered to sit us right away anyway. As I said, we were there for an EARLY dinner, so when we arrived they had their slightly modified menu of appetizers available while we waited for the dinner menu to be distributed. We got the pork rinds, and cheese plate. Those pork rinds were insane. I could not stop eating them. Honestly, amazing. Cheese plate also incredible. A small selection of 3 kinds of cheese with some jams, bread, etc. it did not look like a lot of food, but once we got into it, we realized the amount of cheese etc went a long way. The dinner menu came out and We then proceeded to order several entrees. Everything is shared plates, as they explain when they drop the menus. From what I remember there were small, medium, and large portions to choose from. We started with grilled squid, brussel sprouts, and sardines. The grilled squid was the highlight of my night. Cooked perfectly. Amazing flavors. Sprouts were great as well. The sardines, while tasty, were my least favorite part. Just not what I imagined when i ordered them. We then went on to order MORE food. The pork belly and the broccoli casserole type thing. Both were out of this world. Pork belly and polenta dish went perfectly together. The broccoli was a wonderful suggestion by our server. We were on the fence about it but when he mentioned it was amazing, we took it as a sign that it needed to be ordered. There was so much more on the menu I wanted to try, but after all that food, I was in a near food coma. I can't forget to mention their stellar beer list from which we each ordered a few. Had a couple Belgian style beers, tried a very tasty and interesting sour. Beyond food and beer, I LOVE the ambiance of this restaurant. I'm obsessed with the lights in there (weird, I know). Communal everything, which I think is great. Our server was extremely nice and helpful. Although at some points I did feel a little bit rushed along. I know they get crazy busy in there and probably have a huge list of reservations that they need to accommodate. But I did at times feel like I needed to make decisions and order more quickly than I would have liked. Maybe it's just the service industry worker in me which makes me always feel a little like I'm holding servers up or being a pain.

The owners/managers should only be happy I ate nothing from her station, because it would not have been a pretty sight.Unlike Kevin A's review where he was served uncooked chicken, I would suppose that out of sight = out of mind for the average diner. Unfortunately, this was not out of sight. Within a 45 minute span while I was having dinner, I watched this chef1. Take her spoon, dip it into the saute pan, taste whatever was in it, then immediately proceed to use the spoon to serve the contents of the pan into a dish and send it out to a customer, thus contaminating the dish.2. Pick up a bowl and inspect it for cleanliness, and, finding it less than satisfactorily clean for her, proceed to blow on it, then use her side towel to wipe it out before proceeding to serve into it and send it out to a customer, thus contaminating the dish.3. A basic repeat of #1, except instead of stirring in the pan after tasting, she only tasted, then knocked the spoon against the pan a couple of times to return whatever hadn't been tasted into it, thus contaminating the dish.As if this weren't bad enough, during this time, I saw her either sniffling into the sleeve of her chef coat, coughing into it, or wiping something from her nose into it at least 4 times.THIS IS GROSS, and should not be tolerated, regardless of the chef's talent. In San Francisco she would not survive a full shift in any restaurant.Now that I've ranted, I have to say the food and service justify the great reviews otherwise. If this were a closed kitchen, they would've gotten my 5 star review and I would have been none the wiser. I only hope that no one who had hot seafood there tonight reads this review.

Awesome. \u00a0I haven't decided yet if having 7 people was too many, or if i appreciated it for my first trip to The Publican because we were able to try (literally, we were each able to have about 1 bite of each of the plates) a total of 11 dishes and 3 desserts. \u00a0We had:1) Bone Marrow - we got one of the last 2 they had, and THANK GOD! \u00a0I never thought eating bone marrow would appeal to me, but I will absolutely eat it again, and again, and again.2) Chef's selection of 12 oysters - 6 from the east coast, 6 from the west coast - all delicious. \u00a0The sauce that came with the oysters was fantastic as well.3) Pork Rinds - first time in my life I've eaten pork rinds (they kind of scare me when they are in the bag at the convenience store, eww), but The Publican does these right! \u00a0We ordered a 2nd order of them because they went so fast at our table!4) Frites - would have loved to try the sunny side up egg with the frites, but we stuck to the plain ones. \u00a0I could take or leave these - I feel like there's a lot of other amazing things on the menu that I'd rather have.5) Brussel Sprouts - delicious, wasn't expecting them to be so good.6) Sardines w/ Morels & Hazelnuts - I love Morels.

The space is inviting and the scene upbeat, though perhaps not the best place for a quiet date night. The menu is split into 3 sections: seafood, including an impressive oyster list, meats, and veggies, and the focus on high quality ingredients with simple presentations is right up my alley. Conceptually, this place absolutely works.So why 3 stars? Execution. I did love the sardines, which were pan fried to a nice crisp and were cut with a touch of acidity from the lemon served on the plate. The rest of our dishes, however, fell flat. Being in love with all things culinary and Spanish, we were encouraged to try the trio of hams, each of which was fine, but really nothing to write home about. I know Publican doesn't produce its own ham, but each were very heavy on the salt-cure and the small amount of bread that came with the plate just didn't do enough to cut it. At a place where simple ingredients are the star, this wasn't a great start. I'd give 4 stars to the smoked arctic char, which was well-balanced and about as successful what I'd consider a wintry dish could be served in summertime. Lastly, had heard great things about the little gem salad, so was disappointed to find a huge plate of uncut lettuce drowned in a somewhat bland buttermilk vinaigrette, though the crunch of the pig ears provided a welcome textural contrast.I could probably find it in my heart to round up to 4 stars for a hit & miss performance on the food. But the very lacking service is what brings this review down to a 3. Yes, it's a hot restaurant, and yes we were there at a busy time, but there isn't an excuse to make customers wait 15 minutes to see a menu, another 10 to order wine, and another 15 at the end to get the check after asking for it. The restaurant business is tough for an executive chef: you come up with a great concept, but you still have to execute day in and day out, without being able to micromanage every detail.

This lady was obviously upset at her date for picking the place, complained about everything, yelled at him and then refused to eat anything and proceeded to stare at all the diners making comments about their appearance. So, moral of the story - when making reservation see if you can get a booth (which they have a limited number). Now to the important stuff....FOOD! \u00a0At the late hour they had already run out of a number of their signature dishes. \u00a0We specifically wanted to try the suckling pig which was out (Note - get an earlier reservation time). So, we ended up selecting a half order of the ham, little gem salad with fried pig's ear, sweetbreads, and a side of kale. \u00a0I couldn't eat the ham but my guy throughly enjoy it. \u00a0The salad was divine. \u00a0It had baby carrots and radishes over romaine lettuce and the crunchy pig ear was fried goodness. \u00a0The sweetbread was good but.

But reading someone else's review on Yelp for another brunch place piqued my interest and then I decided to do a little more research. \u00a0I then decided to do some more serious research on Yelp, cause I trust you guys. So armed with the following Yelp knowledge:1. Find street parking (because may be issues with valet)2. Get the two seats in front of the kitchen3. Order the red wine poached eggs4. Order pork rinds - yeah, no kidding5. Bloody Mary is unique and splendid6. Sometimes they forget your reservations7. Kitchen can sometimes forget your food and there is sometimes a lag in service, although the service is attentive and excellent (very hard to understand this, until you actually eat there because it seemingly makes no sense).I finally went to the Publican website - and was really amazed at the cool and warm decor (I like it) and the concept of communal dining - which I kind of like in the right mood. The menu itself was not very good at describing the just about life altering food experience that I would have the next morning - in fact the menu is maybe too understated. Knowing that this place appears to be uber popular - I actually made a reservation from the website through OpenTable for 10:00 a.m. Excited with visions of pork rinds and Bloody Marys - I went to sleep determined to get up early enough to find street parking and make sure I get a table upon arrival.We get there - find street parking and immediately walk into the restaurant, which is in a style that I really liked. They had our reservation, but the restaurant was mainly empty. I noticed that the two seats in front of the kitchen was empty and asked if we could sit there. The hostess said that was no problem and told us it was the best seats in the house (there are only two seats in front of the kitchen). This was a good idea! Definitely enjoyed watching the magic take place.We perused the menu and the waiter was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. He got a beer menu for my hubby and even brought him tastes of two beers. I got the Bloody Mary of course and one of the lighter ales as a beer back. We ordered the pork rinds (my husband was against it at first, until I had the waiter describe them); the salad (so delicious and unique); the red wine poached eggs with prosciutto (extremely delicious!!); the ricotta with honey, cherries and beer bread (refreshing and yummy); and an order of maple bacon.Yelpers so far are dead on correct even as to where things started to get a bit uneven - read on, I am almost done.- As we dined, the restaurant was filling up and the kitchen was getting swamped but orders were coming out nicely. Our food came out in a nice fashion, but the maple bacon was last. We noticed one of the chefs actually hand marking off orders (this may be the source of the problem). The waiter definitely took down the order and even remarked to us that the bacon will be out soon. We waited a long time and finished everything else and were pretty stuffed. The waiter kind of disappeared and no one else really looks at you to check on you as you are nearing the end of your meal. Our coffee needed to be refilled and I can see how people can get a bit frustrated with getting refreshes on drinks. But I know the problem - the servers and support are excellent, but they probably need more of them to serve everyone in the manner they are trained, which is to provide attentive and excellent service. Also, hand marking off an order may not be the most efficient way of handling this as the kitchen clearly forgot the bacon. The waiter did finally come around and he apologized for the bacon, he offered it to us gratis, but we were full by then and only wanted a taste - he brought out two pieces of thick bacon gratis to taste (more like luscious pork belly beautifully cooked in a nicely sweet maple sauce). It was so rich and delicious.I gave the place 5 stars because the food was incredibly delicious. I was so happy the whole time. The price was not outrageous for the quality and it was worth every dime. I want to try the mussels next time, as one Yelper exclaimed that they are the best she has ever had.So thank you Yelpers!

I had been wanting to dine here for a while and brunch seemed like a good way to introduce myself to the Publican. If you hadn't heard, this place has communial seating - meaning you share one big long table with fellow diners. They do have booths though...with barn door on them for privacy. There is also bar seating. Also, I was told I HAD to go to the bathroom so I did. It also is sort of a communial area...really it's just the hand wash area that is shared by both men & women...there are three stalls for the women and three stalls for the men but they aren't really like stalls but more like a tiny bathrooms behind a huge barn doors. You may also notice several different very large pig paintings...because the Publican is like an all out pork fest. Awe yea...So here is the run down...Mrs. S had the smoked trout & bagel combo, my friend Burgee had the red wine poached eggs, Uncle Phil had the omlette, I had the pork shoulder sandwich and my friend T-Bone had the onion tartin (no, I am not making my friend's knick names up - those are really their knick names). We also got some goodies to share...spicy pork rinds, Publican bacon, summer sausage, frites w/egg and truffle hasbrowns. We werent effin around, it was time to get our pork on. Everyone was really happy with everything...and I tried everything except the omlette. The smoked trout was pretty good but I have this thing about fish & cream cheese so I only tried the fish (fish & cream cheese do not belong together...ever) so I had to take Mrs S' word that it was a good combo. I thought Burgee's poached eggs were good and even better with some proscuitto...yes more pork...shocking). I enjoyed the onion tartin - flaky, savory & delicious. I thought the pork shoulder sandwich was pretty solid...how can pork shoulder, bacon and a fried egg NOT be good? Pork rinds - yum. Black truffle hashbrowns - check. Frites and summer sausage - good and good. Now...the bacon. Sigh. Oh Publican bacon...I love you and all your maple syrup braisyness. It's two nice big thick slabs of bacon braised in maple syrup. Don't make the mistake of sharing an order....be selfish and order a side just for yourself or you will find yourself eyeing other people's bacon later. Oh, I don't normally like Bloody Mary's...which is odd b/c I like tomato juice and I certaintly like vodka but everytime I've tried one - blech. Anyhow my friend T-Bone let me take a sip off his Bloody Mary (which comes with a small beer chaser) and I have to say I thought it was pretty damn good. They garnish it with a dice of peppers and zucchini chips and it was pretty tasty. I'll have to get this next time when I come back...oh and I will be back. Now, I was going to give this 3 1/2 stars b/c while I LOVED that bacon and enjoyed everything else we had...there was this loooooong stretch of time that we had to wait for food to come out. They did bring out a couple items for us to nosh on while the rest of our order was being cooked but we all felt the amount of time we had to wait for the rest of our order was WAY too long. If they had brought out our frites at some point during this long time stretch...it would have been better. I just cannot bring my to give this less than 4 stars because the bacon really was that good imo. In closing, the Publican is a pork lover's dream come true.

Since the evening was going to be far from over we decided to make our way over there. The DOD staff recommended the pork \u00a0rinds since it goes well with beer and the seasoning of it. We ordered that for the table and it was gone very quickly. Gone so quickly that we put in another order and it was gone just as quickly. \u00a0 I ordered the boudin blanc which was okay, the sausage was not very flavorful and the golden raisin's sweetness overpowered any there was; the veggies were cooked to deliciousness though. I think the juices were soaked up by the veggies and that's where the flavor came from. The fried shrimp were okay. I found it \u00a0weird to eat the shell didn't add to flavor and the extra crispy consistency was troublesome at worst. The bollito misto was also just okay, the sausage was the best out of the three: sausage, turkey and pork shoulder. The turkey though was really tender. We also had the last of the scallops and despite the fancy cooking, scallops are still just scallops, good but nothing of note. The mussels were okay, a little too bitter for my taste but the drippings made it. I am starting to think that I could probably live off of the drippings alone. My sister came late and after waiting around for our waiter to show up after saying the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes (we put the order in 7 minutes before closing) she got the frites with eggs, it was just fries with eggs.The chocolate souffle was delicious, the ice cream was smoked but I couldn't' really tell the difference. However, it was still a great choice. I got the waffle with honey butter and blueberry preserves, which is nothing special.

We called as we were on our way to ask if we needed a reservation (4pm), and were told that the reservations will full, but we could come by and they'd seat us as soon as possible. Ok fine. The hubby and I were desperate to try the spicy pork rinds, so we thought we'd wait however long we needed to. Well, upon arriving, the place was empty. Only a few seats at the bar taken and one other table. So much for reservations huh! Anyhow, decor first: obviously the Publican is going for a theme... that theme being a literal farm/pig pen. They even have \"booths\" that have pig pen doors to get in and out! Interesting, and unique. I like. Since we were too early for the dinner menu, we were given the limited afternoon menu, which was just fine. They have an extensive beer menu - we asked our server for suggestions, and were VERY happy with whatever it was he brought out for us (wheat for me, dark for the hubby). For our afternoon \"snack\", we ordered the spicy pork rinds, ham platter, half grilled chicken entree, and lamb pastrami sandwich. Let's start with the beloved pork rinds. They were the PERFECT snack to have with beers. They are cheesy, spicy, crackly, salty, porky deliciousness and were devoured quite quickly. Then came the ham platter... even included iberico ham. They definitely didn't skimp on the portion for this starter. There were 4 different types of hams, served with fresh slices of bread and butter (that had sea salt sprinkled on top). Mmmm. I thought I was in Spain. Then came our \"entrees\". The chicken dish was ok. It was roasted chicken and merguez sausage. The sausage was awesome, the chicken... I could make it at home... but good nonetheless. Also, the lamb pastrami sandwich. Can I just say that this may be one of the BEST SANDWICHES EVER!? \u00a0It was an upscale version of a bahn mi sandwich, packed with pastrami, pickled veggies, cilantro, mint, spicy mayo... \u00a0It had the perfect amount of each ingredient, and each flavor profile could be tasted individually and altogether.

I also liked that it was in the Fulton Market as that is one of my all time favorite locations in Chicago. Alright so heres the break down. My GF's bday in September and she really wanted to try this place out so this was perfect timing to take her. so we took our time to get there because we don't live to far from the expressway to get there. So we got there and took about 2 minutes to find parking on the street and not have to pay for it. we went it but took some time to get seated because it seems this place is always busy which I consider a good thing. as we stood up at one of the waiting tables one of our friends came up to us and worked at the publican. started us off with some finger foods and some beers. they really do know how to make sure you get the beer that you enjoy. we finally got to our table and i have to say the menu was a little intimidating because I'm not really a big seafood guy and most of the menu was nothing but.I went ahead and made the exception to go ahead and try some new things/ seafood for the special occasion for my girlfriends birthday. we started with some sauteed corn and raw Halibut that was seasoned which actually was quite good for someone that doesn't like seafood at all. then we got our entrees which were really good i got some chicken dish but was really good even though i can not remember the name of the dish and my girlfriend had a muscle/pasta dish which i went ahead and tried with her and not too bad. From what i have been told this place is really well know for their Oysters and being raw seafood figured i would not enjoy this but went ahead and tried them anyways.this place will not be for everyone but i would say you never know about a place until you try it.

Very tender meat and very flavorful. Also came in a large portion as wellMushroom Burrata - Not as tasty as the other mentioned dishes, but still had plenty of flavor and was a solid additionNow, we ordered this all for two people. The waitress warned us after ordering that we would be on the \"edge of full.\" After some brief banter we decided to go for it and see how it all turned out. About halfway through the meal the waitress came in and apologized (she was very nice about the whole thing) saying that she believed it would indeed be too much food for us and that she was sorry for not being more cautious earlier. She said that if we finished everything she would get us a free dessert. Like we needed anymore incentive with food like this. Our meal slowed to a crawl just at the end. It was just as the waitress had explained before: the edge of full. We couldn't just turn down the offer for dessert, however. We ordered the peanut butter and chocolate pie and got some sort of berry turnover with vanilla ice cream as our bonus (she followed through on her promise). One of the greatest pains for me that night was having to put down my fork before the pie was finished. It was exceptionally delicious slice of pie (graham cracker crust and caramel \u00a0also included, in case I failed to mention).

Grilled very well and had some char parts in the right places. \u00a0Then we ordered the suckling pig (figured i had too since there were supposedly known for their pork). \u00a0Another home run here that came with what seemed like two large pork chops with greens and a smudge of fresh pesto. \u00a0Really nice and grilled to perfection i thought.Finally we went for dessert (as if we hadn't had enough). \u00a0We went for the 32oz fresh press with cruz that la sur coffee. \u00a0Very good choice we thought. \u00a0We drank it with some sort of chocolate tart and an single portion apple pie...which honestly i can't remember too much of since i was ready to fly at this point. \u00a0Couldn't eat or drink any further.Needless to say, this place deserves 5 starts and can't wait to go back.", "Date": "2011-03-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jeff R.", "ReviewID": "ve67ylIhs-NSIpyl0872og", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll join everyone else when I say the atmosphere and d\u00e9cor are top notch and not done justice through pictures. It's a lively \"beer hall\" style experience with communal tables and a standing bar area. The room has a nice rumble of noise emanating from happy eaters and drinkers. It's a place that encompasses happy people all sharing a similar experience drinking and eating good food. The beer list is quite interesting and full of choices you might not find in many places in Chicago. Don't expect to find $3 bud lights or PBRs and most beers are large format with large format type prices.We ordered a lot of food not because we were particularly hungry but because we wanted to sample what was on the menu that evening. For starters we had an order of pork rinds, French fries with an egg on top and steak tartare. I could stop right there and explain how eating those dishes would be more fat and cholesterol that I would want to consume in an entire week. But as they say, \"when in Rome\"...I've never been a pork rind fan and that didn't change much after some of ones I had. If you get a good one that is light and airy, I can see the appeal. I also had one that was super tough and a potential tooth breaker. Oh well, maybe it's a sign. Not surprising the fries with egg was awesome. What could be better than fried potatoes with eggs? Sounds like breakfast to me. We both were disappointed in the steak tartare - it tasted a bit more chewy and rare than the better ones I've had. It also lacked some basic flavor and seasonings. You shouldn't be reminded that you're eating raw meat.The two fish dishes we tried were the squid and sablefish. I didn't mind nor didn't love the squid dish. It was served with a nice brown rice and some greens with avocado. The raw squid is exactly what it sounds like, raw little octopus guys. Not a whole lot going on without a lot of flavor either, but that's the appeal of raw seafood right? The smoked sablefish was an interesting fish I don't think I've had before. It was served on rye bread with fromage blanc, beets & endive. The dish was well presented and cooked, though I imagine sablefish is a strong flavor that you either like or don't like. I'm in between but probably leaning on don't like since I doubt I'd run back to order that dish again.We went with two meat dishes, blood sausage and spare ribs. I actually liked the blood sausage even though I definitely don't want to know how that's made. There were a lot of good and interesting flavors with a texture I could handle. The spare ribs were not my favorite and more challenging to eat than I expected. As Brendan noted, they gave you the whole darn rump, with all the fat and cartilage intact. Even if the meat was tasty it was very hard to get at without a lot of work or consuming \"the extras.\" We also ordered a side of ramps, a.k.a. wild leeks, something I had never tried before. I enjoyed them and the basic presentation but flavorful sauce and cooking flavors. I guess it's a unique taste a la collard greens or similar root vegetables. Maybe I was just craving something green after all the pork and meat.I had a few great beers but could not tell you which ones because I just asked our server to bring me something good. When it was all said and done the check arrived and I was definitely surprised. Yes, we ordered a lot of food and didn't eat all of it but looking at a $160 bill for two is still a little startling. And apparently that's not uncommon from what I could gather. So what's my takeaway? It's a great place to hang out and drink with a very tailored menu. If you're not a huge pork or oyster/raw bar person I don't know if it's a good fit. I can see the talent of the kitchen in their product even if it's not something I'd order every day or ever again. Everyone raves about two things I have yet to try: the pork belly and the Sunday brunch (one of the best in town?). While it may not become a favorite go-to for me, I'd suggest everyone to check it out in case the food matches the impressive d\u00e9cor, service and drinks (but bring your larger wallet).", "Date": "2011-04-28", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "David M.", "ReviewID": "fkgzcb6fDyiNakMywbLiXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome meal and then some. \u00a0Great staff, a slight mix up on a Thursday night walk-in lead to a complimentary appetizer and desert port! \u00a0The oysters were fresh and delish! \u00a0The ambiance a little trendy but not snotty, and the food was outstanding. \u00a0Highly recommended for dinner!", "Date": "2011-05-22", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Cynthia k.", "ReviewID": "uJ5Wc5ui-lgutkfXdeCYsQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "meh. \u00a0i had gone to the blackbird two nights before, so had high expectations for the publican. \u00a0but honestly - it was just okay.had the summer salad, which was a very strange mix of quinoa, farro, raspberries and sugar snap peas. \u00a0i thought perhaps the flavors would work together...they don't.tried the exalted pork rinds. \u00a0they just taste like...pork rinds. \u00a0except covered in weird cheetos-type powder. \u00a0not good.had the chicken. \u00a0okay, this dish was actually very very well cooked - i know how difficult it is to cook chicken without overdoing the white meat, so i was impressed they were able to do it here. \u00a0however, laying it on top of the fries left them soggy and soaked with sauce, and i'm not sure how i feel about pairing it with giant pieces of sausage. \u00a0i like sausage, but it just seemed out of place on the plate.lots of beers on the menu, and the dining room has a college dining hall feel to it with the long communal tables.i doubt i would go back, but if i did, i would probably try the ham selection and the oysters, which our neighbors seemed to enjoy.", "Date": "2011-07-27", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Kara P.", "ReviewID": "XO5RUqHFWm0T4bKmP8peCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "food: YUM-O! \u00a0my friends and i had such a great time at the publican. the food was AMAZING, the ambiance was super fun and the wine was delish. \u00a0yes yes! \u00a0i highly recommend getting the mussels (omg yum), yellowtail crudo, summer squash, fried eggplant, ham chop (lots of goodness!), a selection of oysters and a plate of different hams. \u00a0amaze.service: super fun and very knowledgeable...yet not in your face, you know?final thoughts: i can't wait to go back to chicago and to take my husband here!", "Date": "2011-08-21", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Samuel M.", "ReviewID": "P5neyzYAXZOn_AE580sWDg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A uniformly amazing, thoroughly manly, decadent dining option.

Still, Bell's Octoberfest, North Coast Old #38 Stout, and Autumn Maple (10.5% alcohol) did not disappoint by any stretch of the imagination-Oysters on the half shell were all delicious and noticeably different in taste from one another. The same can be said about the \"Taste of Three hams\"-Duck liver pate is rich, has an unexpected yet very pleasant mustardy bite, and is served with, but not overwhelmed by, currants-Anchovies are fresh rather than canned, and cooked whole like smelts. Delicious-Hangar steak is perfectly cooked and complemented surprisingly well by feta and blueberries-Country rib is seared to a delectable crisp and melts like butter when you cut it with a fork-Desserts (nectarine tart with salted caramel ice cream, waffle with vanilla ice cream and rosemary syrup) are surprisingly worth saving room for.-Inside decor is like a classed-up German beer hall, but having said that, on a nice night opt for dining outside.

The occasion wasn't noted for the freebie, but its always appreciated. \u00a0This is our kind of place. \u00a0Wall art was of swine. \u00a0They seemed to know where just about everything on their menu was sourced from, mostly local small farms. \u00a0Seasonal produce. \u00a0Unique dishes. \u00a0Staff was very knowledgeable about the menu (the one item that came out that we found out had flour in it was quickly noted to be removed from the bill, and the waiter very quickly triple checked everything else we ordered). \u00a0The menu is a little lacking for descriptions, so we asked a lot of questions, which didn't seem to bother them at all. \u00a0A little more description on the menu would go a long way, but I guess that would take away from the minimalist reading they are going for.Started with the halibut crudo. \u00a0Nice fresh and fatty raw fish. \u00a0Very refreshing.Followed with the Scallops. \u00a0Not really wow, but very tasty. \u00a0The melted leeks were really good.Our choice of vegetable was the baby artichokes. \u00a0This came with a spring pea sformato, which was basically a savory mousse (which had flour in it). \u00a0I was able to eat the sformato, which was very tasty. \u00a0The artichokes were very good also.The larger courses we had started with the rabbit balantine. \u00a0We didn't really know what a balantine was, and with no description on the menu, we had to ask, but was still a little unsure what to expect. \u00a0I believe the description was 'rabbit saddle wrapped around mortadella, and cooked through with a crispy skin'. \u00a0It pretty much was a mortadella sausage with a flavorful, crispy skin. \u00a0Good flavor, but the mortadella was the primary taste, not the rabbit. \u00a0Second large dish was the suckling pig. \u00a0The first bite was soooo good, I had to put the fork down and lean back in my chair. \u00a0Slow cooked, almost all dark meat tender pork. \u00a0Crispy outside. \u00a0Dripping in pork fat. \u00a0We had the parmesan fondue on the side (gluten), which was the way to have it (really, the fondue wasn't needed at all). \u00a0I think it would have taken away from the awesomeness of the suckling pig if it was on top. \u00a0A definite must have dish in my opinion.If/when we are able to get back to Publican, we will probably be more adventurous, as we usually try to be. I know their menu changes regularly, but I wish we'd have tried something like the fresh sardines, or the duck hearts.We saw many tables order the spicy pork rinds, which looked, and sounded great. \u00a0Table next to us ordered & split the farm chicken, which also looked great.Highly recommended. \u00a0We could have chosen a hoity-toity restaurant, and maybe had fun eating a 'foam' something, or a 'deconstructed' something, but I'm very glad we came to Publican for our anniversary. \u00a0A little out of our way, and a little pricy, so will probably have to be relegated to special occasions.", "Date": "2012-05-22", "Author_Location": "Glendale Heights, IL"}, {"Author": "Joe S.", "ReviewID": "QtpgeKs22gJb2QP09fq-8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came here for brunch and had an amazing meal.

Hard to match that experience.We had the scallops with fava beans, which were delicious. The striped bass was good, not my favorite of the night but it wasn't terrible either. It had a mineral taste to it in which I was not a fan. The sweetbreads were hands down my favorite. They were prepared different from the last time ( I went in the summer as compared to early spring) but the combination of flavors this time with the pesto was amazing! They were unfortunately out of the shaved brussel sprouts but we opted for the beet salad instead and it was a wise choice. The beets were served in a yogurt dressing with basil and it was so refreshing and delicious. We ended the meal with the half of farm house chicken which was delicious but we were already full from the rest of our meal.

needless to say, I'm really glad I opted for a small salad and a two-mile run for lunch before coming here. \u00a0I arrived a little bit early, and was able to pick from their ample and very refined beer selection (I didn't catch a whiff of any other beverages being offered, though there appears to be a full bar) while I stood and read a magazine at one of their pub tables. \u00a0I have to admit I really appreciate the increasing respect that brew craft is being shown, with many restaurants listing their beers as they would their wines - really paying attention to quality and food pairing. \u00a0The Publican is definitely one of those places. \u00a0After the meal I was informed that there are also special price fixe meals where the chefs pair up with different domestic breweries to create specialty brew and meal combinations.After my party arrived, we got to sit at the end of one of the communal tables, which provided ample room for the feast which ensued. \u00a0We decided to have the sardines, the charcuterie plate, the shrimp, the bollito misto, the farm chicken, and the brussels sprouts. \u00a0 Out of all these dishes, the only one I probably wouldn't repeat would be the chicken - not because it was anything less than delicious, but because I'm just not a massive fan of poultry - however, the summer sausage and frites that came on the side were amazing. \u00a0Highlights of the meal would include the brussels sprouts (wonderful), the frites (they absorbed all the taste of the chicken, but had a great underlying flavor of their own), the cotechino sausage in the misto (blew my mind, really - what a wonderful flavor combination), and the head cheese (ok, never had it before and always thought it looked nasty when I saw it in the deli - this was a far cry from the stuff grandpa ate, and totally delicious).I also want to draw special attention to the mustard that was included in the charcuterie plate - I was happy to learn that they're about 6 months from bottling and selling some of the sauces and mustards they make there. \u00a0If they offered the mustard I had tonight for sale, I would buy it in an instant and have it around for all the brats and goodies I grill in the warmer months.On to dessert. \u00a0We had the chocolate souffle and the creme brule. \u00a0My father in law wasn't a fan of the 'smoked' chocolate ice cream, but I thought it was great. \u00a0It is exactly what it tastes like - a sweet, smoky confection. \u00a0I can completely understand where he was coming from though - some people want their sweets sweet, and do not want to deal with other, unexpected, and even seemingly contradictory flavors coming in. \u00a0For my part, I really enjoyed the anise cookies that came with the creme brule, and the tiny personal pot of jasmine tea with the tea pearl blooming inside.Over all, this place had the entire package: \u00a0excellent selection of ingredients, from the beers, to the meats, to the garnishes. \u00a0Extremely professional and fast wait staff. \u00a0Our desserts took about five minutes longer than one would expect them to, and our waiter came out before they had even arrived to say they would be comped (they literally showed up 30 seconds later).Unique venue -

And yes, that's a bold and ballsy statement to make when Chicago has SO many good restaurants.I came here on Saturday evening to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, and had made a reservation through Open Table for 7pm. I requested one of the private tables specifically in the request, and the majority of the diners are seated at a large table in the center of the restaurant. \u00a0It's not a huge deal, but if you're looking for a more private dinner, I'd highly recommend requesting this in your reservation. \u00a0We were seated in one of the \"pig stall\" tables where you're literally boxed into a table that resembles an animal's stall. While this kind of freaked out the one vegetarian diner in our party, we enjoyed how secluded we felt while in the stall. Upon being seated, we were shown the menu and given a quick run-down on the way it works. All of the food is supposed to be ordered at once so that they can bring it out in courses, and all of the items are intended to be shared. Since we had a vegetarian in the group, it kind of created a lack of flow later in the night, but that was to be expected. Before we started picking apart the menu to decide what we wanted, we shifted our focus to the expansive beer menu to pick out a few unique brews. They have an extensive Belgian offering, which was to our liking.As for the food, this was the second time I was at the Publican and I was blown away. We decided to order the following:1) The Daily Pickles2) Chicken Liver Pate3) Pork Belly (Obviously, you have to get this here)4) Boudin Blanc5) Bollito Misto6) Octopus7) Fried CauliflowerThe Daily Pickles came out first, and it took us by surprise. We all were thinking that it would be a plate of pickles, but nope, it was a variety of pickled vegetables. There was picked red onion which was a spicy vinegar infusion of flavor that was outstanding. There was also pickled cauliflower that was bright yellow and was surprisingly delicious. Lastly, there were lightly pickled cucumbers which tasted like bread and butter pickles. This dish was so amazing that it was gone within a minute (and I'm barely exaggerating here) and we put in another order as it was only a whopping $4. The Octopus came out next, which is what the vegetarian member of our party ordered. She let us each sample a piece of it, and I really enjoyed this dish. Normally I'm not a fan of grilled calamari due to its rubbery texture, but this was about as far away from it as you could get. It had a nice bite to it and was wonderfully flavored. My only regret of the evening was that we hadn't ordered this for the whole table. The pork belly came out next, which is a tried and true dish that is executed perfectly here. The artichokes, olives, and grits really enhanced the flavor, and it was gone all too quickly. Next up was the Bollito Misto which came in a cast iron pan and was piping hot. The medley of tender, well flavored meats simmering in a salsa verde sauce was amazing. It reminded me of a soupy-stew that had a sampling of a wide range of meats and veggies. I really enjoyed this dish. Lastly, for the main courses, the boudin blanc arrived. This was simply a white sausage on a bed of veggies. To be honest, this was my least favorite dish of the night as it wasn't very interesting. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it just lacked a certain something. After all of these items came out, we had to wait about 10 minutes for the fried cauliflower. I think there was some kitchen mishap as I overheard a few other tables asking about it and the waitress seemed a bit flushed. Regardless, the fried cauliflower was worth the wait. It was lightly breaded and cooked to perfection--not at all mushy and it had a nice crunch to it. The cauliflower was served over a green chili sauce that was extremely tasty.Lastly, to finish off the meal, we went with their waffle with maple ice cream, peanut brittle, and peanut butter hot fudge sauce. I have had their signature waffle in the past, but this one blew it out of the water. The maple ice cream paired with the waffle was a nice touch, as this was a tribute to the classic waffle and maple flavor combination. Although, with the addition of the peanut butter fudge and the peanut brittle, the waffle was incredible. This is a dessert that you have to get, no matter how full you are, and if it's on the menu.The service here is also top notch--your water glass will rarely ever reach the point of being empty and they are prompt with drink orders. Our waitress was extremely nice, and struck a great balance with checking in on us just enough to not be intrusive. She also had a great sense of humor and great recommendations.As a final note, the Publican gave my boyfriend a free cupcake for his birthday with a candle. It's always a nice touch when restaurants acknowledge a special event and help you celebrate.I can't wait until I get to venture back to the Publican.", "Date": "2012-04-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kate P.", "ReviewID": "bh1j3yohhy22teH1rwaw3g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We sat out on the patio so we didn't get to experience the full ambience of the dining room, but had a delicious meal nonetheless.

From the open communal dining hall with pig stalls along the side walls to the interesting bathroom arrangement. It is a different experience which I enjoyed. The service was excellent as well. Really played up to a \"fine dining\" billing without being too pretentious. Our waiter was attentive and seemed to know exactly when to come by to order another drink or bring the next course. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the extensive beer list. And the spacing between the dishes were timed perfectly. Our dishes seemed to arrive immediately after finishing the previous dish without any delay or any backup. To sit and eat and drink for 3.5 hours was nice and not common nowadays. Now getting to why I just cant bring myself in rating this above a 2 star rating. The beers were excellent. Similar to Hopleaf in that you can try beers not often available at ur local grocers, they do compliment the dishes.... any beverage would. The 5 dishes we ordered were the trio ham starter, the frites with egg, the duck hearts, the potee, and the sea bass. All of them were uber salty. Painfully saltly. Waking up int he middle of the night 3 times to get water- kinda salty. Also the price points are ridiculous. For that amount of money there are much better places to dine. Hopleaf by comparison is much more reasonable in price while being equally salty. I suggest coming here to check it out. it is very unique in its build out and an interesting place to get a drink before going to eat an actual dinner. Service is great and you will feel well taken care of but the food is a complete miss. If you must eat something go for the frites with eggs. Definitely skip the ham app and the hearts. Your blood pressure will rise 100% after those two dishes. Overall, while the service and atmosphere did not disappoint the food did. And really food should be the main attraction.

The hostess caught me by surprise and said there is one available right away. \u00a0Finally, my chance to hop in and see what everyone has been raving about.We were promptly seated at the bar where the beers were being poured. \u00a0I'm not sure if the pourer was a cicerone or not, but as I asked him about the recent Lagunitas' dinner, he pulled out the last remaining special and happily served it to me. \u00a0Throughout the meal, our waiter served us various pourings on the house, to compliment our meals. \u00a0I have never experienced such extraordinary service.I'm not one to walk around with my nose in the air, thinking I'm a big shot. \u00a0I was dressed in a blue undershirt and jeans (definitely underdressed) and I was being treated as if I actually did matter to them.Apps: charcuterie, sardines, pork rindsWe all decided to share the entire fare. \u00a0The first courses consisted of the charcuterie, sardines and pork rinds (of course) \u00a0The head cheese \u00a0and morteau was delicate and amazing. \u00a0The sardines, I believe pan fried, were slightly crispy but still soft enough to filet with the back of my spoon. When the Pork Rinds came out, they looked like normal pork rinds. \u00a0These were dusted with cheese, when you take a big crunchy bite into these airy morsels, they suddenly become soft and full of piggy flavor. From what I remember about pork rinds, they are usually crunchy, flavorless and scrape the roof of my mouth.

One thing though that I want to say is that I have never before eaten around so many people that I would like to punch between bites. It's very, very loud already, so you can't really ignore them, and apparently the wait staff doesn't mind if some patrons get out of control. One party in the \"pens\" was drunk and disruptive, and the staff did nothing. In addition to shouting, they were even harassing diners around them... nothing mean, just being really obnoxious and constantly interrupting others even when it looked like they wanted to be left alone. I guess the Publican wants to look like a chill place, but I felt the staff should've mentioned something and asked them to keep things in check. In terms of \"types\" populating the Publican, there are a lot of trustafarians (read: college girls with Balenciaga bags), grown-up frat boys reusing those popped-up collar polo shirts from 2004, twenty-somethings who take those American Apparel ads with minimal clothing a bit too literally, and the kind of obnoxious poser hipsters who give the actual hipsters a bad name. While I don't usually pay too much attention to other diners, factors like the close quarters with the communal tables, the tremendous volume, and having to navigate between people standing around the bar to get to your seat, all these mean that other diners are very much a part of your Publican experience. If you can deal, good on you, enjoy the deliciousness. But I would definitely pause eating at the Publican again if it looked super full.Some minor quibbles -- we had a reservation, but they still crammed us tightly next to some other people on the communal table. This was despite the numerous empty spaces further down the communal table, which remained empty for our entire meal. Also, considering it was brunch, there was a massive fail on the staff's part on keeping the coffee cups filled.

The food speaks for itself. \u00a0Everything was BEYOND delicious! I would suggest dining on a weeknight, as the staff doesn't seem to be able to handle the stress of a busier night. The disappointed with the staff started from the moment I walked in. \u00a0After being greeted, giving my name, I was told I would not be seated until my reservation time (with an emphasis on not). \u00a0Seemed a little harsh, but we were early and expected to wait a bit. \u00a0They made room for us at the standing bar while we waited; this was wonderful! They controlled the limited space for patrons who were going to be dine with them. \u00a0Before doing so, they \u00a0asked if we wanted a drink before being escorted to the standing bar, but told we should order from their instead. \u00a0Ten minutes later, we were greeted by staff--should have just ordered the beer from the front of the house. \u00a0Staff was knowledgeable about beer/wine, but you definitely got the feeling that you were being bothersome. \u00a0RECOMMENDATION: \u00a0look at the beer list a head of time. \u00a0They provide place of origin/titles of beer, no descriptions. \u00a0Getting to our table was fine, however we were seat 25 minutes past our reservation time. So much for being seated AT our reservation time as the hostess rudely explained upon arrival. The restaurant was quite loud making an intimate dinner difficult, but manageable (we were expecting this on a Friday). \u00a0 Waitstaff was slow and not terribly attentive, but she knew her menu and gave great recommendations! She told us food is served family style/small plates and will just come out as they are available. \u00a0Spacing between our first 3 dishes starter, vegetable, 'entree') were great! Then we waited. And waited. And waited. \u00a0Someone who's not afraid to speak up, it just took a long time to get our waitress's attention. Seeing how she never checked on us after taking our order, this should not have come as a surprise. \u00a0We wanted our fourth and final dish. \u00a0 \u00a0Finally getting the waitress's attention, we discussed the situation, and she said she was spacing out the plates for us. \u00a0Translation: the kitchen made a mistake, or she did. \u00a0The chicken was still 5 minutes from making its way out! This meant that we would have had it served to us almost 30 mins after the third small plate! The moment that lie came out of her mouth, I was done. I just said cancel the chicken and bring us our check. \u00a0She apologized and with the utmost professionalism, took the chicken off (rightly so) and comped our drinks and well. \u00a0I felt this was a very fair way to correct the mistake; however the damage was done. \u00a0There just \u00a0seemed to be too much staff. \u00a0Everyone had just one job with no real oversight. \u00a0No quality control.

The Quiche was also pretty good, a crumbly, traditional crust packed with moist egg and studded with cheese.

It's so thick and fat and fatty and smoky and crispy in all the right places, you don't even need the maple glaze. But it's still delicious, so why not? It was easily the standout dish of the meal, and it was only a side. Runner up goes to the Cinnamon Roll, which was perfectly soft and gooey on the inside. And more restaurants, please do your butter like this. Let it sit out. Let it soften. Put it on the table before I even get there. Being greeted by butter is never a bad thing.

Jennifer, our waitress, was really friendly and knowledgeable. They seem to have maybe one or two few waiters for the number of tables, but Jennifer always said \"thanks for waiting\" if she took slightly too long to get back to us, so you knew she was doing her best. On to the food. OOoooh the food. Wow. My bf had two oysters, which he loved (the kumamoto and the beau soleil), we then had the mussels.. wow. We actually just got back from a trip to Belgium and these mussels knocked the socks off of any that we had (and paid a lot more for) in Belgium. They are cooked in gueze, a type of belgian lambic, and herbs and i could have drank the sauce straight it was so delicious. We next had the veal brain. Outstanding again. And we ended with the rillettes. I am a huge fan of rillettes and this one did not let me down. we both thought it worked better without the bread, perhaps slicing the bread slightly thinner would work better, but it was still spectacular. We were also both really impressed with the beer menu. They have a lot of great beers on draught and tap and the draughts are pretty reasonably priced (~5-7 dollars). We ended the evening with the waffle (As suggested by Alberto :) ). It had an excellent texture, crispy but very light and fluffy inside, and some dessert wine that was also superb.

If you go to the Publican for one thing make it the brussel sprouts and bacon, I have never had anything so delicious, the bacon literally melted in my mouth.

When a restaurant receives a lot of hype such as this I think it's either really as good as people say or the majority of diners are simply saying the food is good bc they're engaging in groupthink. Well, after having dinner at the Publican, I can confirm that it's the former. I wouldnt say everything we had was a hit, but I will say I love the fresh food and the variety of dishes served. So here's a rundown of what we had:Halibut crudo: This was very good and I would definitely recommend ordering it. I thought it was very fresh and light. A great dish to start off with.Potted rillettes: Loved this. Prob my fav dish of the night. Have ya'll noticed how restaurants never seem to give enough bread with spreads? Luckily, we had asked for bread at the beginning of dinner, so when we ran out of the toasted bread that came with the dish we simply spread the rillettes over the complimentary bread we received earlier. Honestly, I really dont know how the cherries enhanced or complimented the rillettes. Even without the cherries, this dish wouldve been yummy.Country ribs: This was another hit. I could really taste the citrus flavor in the meat. And there were two large chunks of meat, so portion size was great. The slices of oranges scattered throughout the dish didnt really do anything to enhance the flavor of the meat but I guess it was just there for presentation's sake.Livornese fish stew: Served with what I believe to be garlic bread. I generally love fish stew, but I'd say skip this one. I've had better at Calo. It wasnt bad (although a tad salty), but as I've said Ive had better elsewhere so I'd save my money for something else on the menu. I certainly dont believe it was worth $29.We had another dish from the vegetable section of the menu, but I dont recall what it was called. It consisted of eggplant and ground lamb. In regards to this dish, I'd say if you see something similar on the menu, skip it. It tasted like sloppy joe. I've had better manwiches.We also had dessert. A blueberry shortcake with lemon curd and this banana ice cream dessert, the exact term for which I cant remember. Anywho, my fellow dinner mate enjoyed his banana ice cream but I didnt really like my shortcake. Specifically, I didnt like the basil ice cream that was in the dessert. Minus the basil ice cream, I wouldve like this dessert more.In terms of service, our waitress was really helpful, answering any questions we had about items on the menu. I dont really have much to say about the wait staff. I thought they did their job well.Ambiance: We had an early dinner, arriving at the restaurant a little before 530 on a Sunday. Early on it was pretty nice and quiet, but it slowly got louder and louder as more and more diners sat down for dinner. I had expected this so no complaints. I just know to show up early to avoid the noisier atmosphere.", "Date": "2011-07-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Robert H.", "ReviewID": "_vsUaYTF6S8MN3SxkUa0GA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Leaving one star sucks...

Public.... Communal...Libations- I ordered a special drink they had that day called a Pub Radler. \u00a0It is a delicious and refreshing summery drink with lemonade, ginger ale, bourbon, and lager. \u00a0The Mrs. had a Publican Mimosa with citrusy light ale instead of champaign. \u00a0Both were inspired creations and perfect on a hot summer day in Chicago. \u00a0Menu- Although I got a glimpse of the main menu, I was using the Saturday brunch menu that included items from soft shell crab to pork schnitzel to scrambled eggs. \u00a0Good variety without having too many options. \u00a0Raw oysters seem to be one of their specialties, however, I did not try it. \u00a0I had the pork schnitzel, and others in my party got soft shell crab, thick cut bacon, egg foccacia, and raspberry butter cake. \u00a0We also had sides of spicy pork rinds and hash brown potatoes. \u00a0All of the items I sampled were excellent, and I would order them again. \u00a0The bacon.... sweet maple, smokey, salty, sweet, yummy fatty delicious BACON is probably the best bacon I have ever had. \u00a0Looking at the menu, signage, and ambiance, pork does seem to be their specialty. \u00a0After the meal- we shared a 32oz coffee press for us four (a stretch for four people... I think an additional 16 oz would have filled us up a bit more). \u00a0The regular roast is advertised in the menu as their own, while the decaf option is by Intelligensia (we did not try decaf). \u00a0The house roast from the press was rich and creamy without being too bold. \u00a0To accompany our coffee we ordered two plates of banana bread, which was perfect as each plate had two slices. \u00a0The bread was more dense then I am used to, but the dish was jazzed up with mint leaves and raspberries. \u00a0This restaurant is the perfect place for me to get out of my comfort zone and try dishes I have only seen on foodie TV shows but never tried for myself. \u00a0They also have familiar comfort food options. \u00a0 \u00a0I am glad I do not live near this restaurant. \u00a0I would always \"pig\" out.", "Date": "2012-06-24", "Author_Location": "Sycamore, IL"}, {"Author": "Emily L.", "ReviewID": "6BMFlBe9wHdb5ZbbvNAUlQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Last night was my 2nd trip to the Publican.

A few things were really great: our drinks, the country ribs, the summer squash, the pork belly, the mussels, and the oysters. Food-wise, we were underwhelmed by the pork rinds (the coating was reminded me of bad cheetos), the soft shell crab (way too hard/crispy), and the blood sausage (just didn't like it).Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, but there were a few missteps. We never received 2 orders that we placed, although they were still on our bill. We didn't say anything to the waiter, because we were sort of waiting for the dishes to arrive. By the time we realized, \"Okay, these probably aren't coming,\" it was the end of the meal.

I have two tips for you about Publican, the first being: make a reservation. \u00a0I had to make ours two weeks in advance. The larger your party, the longer you'll have to wait sans reservation, as Publican makes use of a large communal table in the center of the restaurant, and a few individual tables around the perimeter. \u00a0I can already sense your hesitance about the communal table, but it really isn't nearly as awkward as it sounds. They give you plenty of space, so the likelihood of your neighbor reaching over and accidentally taking a sip of your OJ is pretty unlikely. Moving on...the ambiance is open, clean, and makes beautiful use of the space. And they have giant pig artwork on each wall.Our menu for the morning consisted of the following:Blueberry almond breakfast cake: Crumbly and flavorful, but not overly sweet. An excellent compliment to your coffee or tea while you wait for your food to be delivered. One slice is definitely enough for two to share.French toast w/maple breakfast sausage: This was my dish, and I'll be honest - I spent half of my time with the breakfast cake and bacon, and the other half of my time with food envy over the biscuits and gravy. Don't get me wrong, the french toast was good - the bread was thick, making it custardy with a crisp crust. I think I second guessed what I was in the mood for, and chose wrong. However, if you're in the mood for french toast, definitely give this a try.Black pepper biscuits & neck bone gravy: I think this had a different name on the menu, but you get the gist. The biscuit was flaky, but not too buttery, and just the right consistency to compliment the rich, tomato based gravy. The dark, smoky gravy brought out the black pepper in the biscuit quite well. A small portion, but packed enough flavor to make up for its size.Publican bacon: Tip number two for Publican: get the bacon. I'm not kidding. This is the best bacon I've ever eaten in my life. I wasn't sure I'd like it, because it's very thick-cut maple-y bacon, but holy cow...er, pig? It's amazing.

It was a pre fixe menu, which can be a scarey thought for a vegetarian! However, we told them when we made the reservation that there was a vegetarian in the group, and they were so accomodating! It was truly excellent. They made a vegetarian option for each course, and they were all delicious! The server was pleasant, welcoming, and acted like it was no problem at all to make everything completely vegetarian. She even asked whether a little anchovies in the pasta sauce were a problem, which they were, so they made me a separate (delicious!) creme fraiche sauce, completely vegetarian. All of the vegetarian dishes reflected the regular meaty dishes, which my friends said were excellent. The last course was a pork loin with white beans and kale, and the vegetarian option was a white bean and kale stew served over a slightly grilled piece of garlic french bread, The bread had a crisper exterior, but was soaked in the stew, pointing out a similar texture to that of the meat. Obviously, eating a stew with French bread is not eating a big chunk of pork, nor should it be.

First off, I HATE restaurants that try to be trendy for the sake of acting cool. \u00a0This concept of \"everything's meant to share, therefore you are not allowed to order an individual meal, and just to keep you from doing it anyway, we're going to refuse to send all the orders out at the same time\" makes me want to punch people. I think there should be a warning on the web site and on the menu and on the door of the restaurant. \u00a0Here, I'm going to warn you: This restaurant forces you to share a bunch of dishes with the table. \u00a0Anywho...once we got past our disgust at this style of restaurant and (to the waitress' obvious horror and discontent) ordered individually (how odd of us!), we attempted to salvage our dining experience by forcing ourselves to get over it. \u00a0The food came out sporadically. \u00a0The ham was delicious, and I'd recommend that if you go there (and I don't recommend you even go) that you order the ham. \u00a0The farm chicken was disgusting. \u00a0It tastes like they dumped a bucket of Lawry's seasoning over it, and it made us ill. \u00a0The bread, as mentioned, is very, very yummy. \u00a0The ahi tuna has no flavor and despite the menu saying it has a pistachio crust, it does not. \u00a0So...not sure why the menu lies. The beer list is outstanding. Be prepared that even though this is a \"sharing restaurant,\" each dish is too small to be shared. You will be forced to order more than one dish per person at the table (at least two, I'd say). I can only assume they do this to rack up the bill and trick you into spending way more money than you would at the average spendy restaurant.

Great, open atmosphere, not as cramped as Avec, for comparison. Extremely knowledgeable waiter; he knew the menu inside and out. The chef's selection of oysters: fresher than expected, delicious. The spicy pork rinds: best I've had in a restaurant setting by far, addictive (sorry, No. 1 vote still goes to my Grandma, RIP). One of the best and most extensive and diverse beer menus in any city I've been to in recent memory. The sweetbreads: yum yum yum. (My friend had never had sweetbreads before and he exclaimed, \"This is what I've been missing?!\") Scallops were really good. Then the Whole Hog (poached loin al' tonnato, tagliolini alla chitarra, spicy chorizo & rib tips, and figs): every item was salivatingly awesome and simply made. I couldn't pick a favorite dish. The experience as a whole was fantastic. It's like a symphony (a porcine one); the waiter's orchestration of the order of dishes was well done, each dish built upon the previous and was a set up for the next. You should not pass up on this, if you're dining in a group, two people, or alone. The dessert waffle was a really good and simple way to end it all.

Reservations - Highly recommended. \u00a0Place was packed for a Monday night at 6. Location - Near meat packing district. Service - At first, I didn't care for our server. \u00a0He was rushing everything and we could hardly flag him down. \u00a0 It was our first time there and he seem to speed through the menu. \u00a0However, as the night wore on, he was super nice and funny. \u00a0We ordered a slew of food and he chose when the order came out and food pairings. \u00a0Ambiance - Dark, lots of wood. Lots of windows and glass doors that open to an outdoor seating. Communal seating so make friends. \u00a0Place gets super loud so it's not the best date place. \u00a0You can try to request a booth but there aren't that many. \u00a0The booths are closed off \u00a0with swinging doors like pig quarters. \u00a0 Round tall bar tables are set up in the middle of the restaurant but it's standing room only. \u00a0 The restrooms are interesting. \u00a0There are three women stalls and two men. \u00a0However, the sinks are communal for both sexes. Food - Superb. \u00a0It's recommended that you have everything family style and share. \u00a0The menu is a bit complex since they don't list out what is an appetizer vs entree. 1. Chef's selection of oysters (six) - Fresh but then again I had the meatier ones. \u00a0My cousin who had one of the smaller ones said it was fishy. \u00a0Was accompanied with a mignonette sauce which I don't care for. \u00a0 No horseradish or cocktail sauce which was also fine with me. \u00a0I like mine simple with lemon and salt. \u00a02. Market salad - Definitely get this! \u00a0Super refreshing summer salad. Vegetables are crisp, fresh and summer sweet. 3. Beet Salad - One of my favorites! \u00a0Sweet beets paired with creamy ricotta and tangy balsamic. \u00a0YUM.4. Frites with Louis's organic egg - Subpar. \u00a0Overly crispy, medium cut fries. \u00a0Hardly salted and topped with two sunny side up eggs. \u00a0We dipped the fries in the yolk but the after that, it was just a bowl of fries with egg whites. \u00a0Skip it. 5. Basque fish stew - Amazing! Good amount of fresh seafood. Light broth that had a spicy bite to it. \u00a0Came with big cuts of toasted country bread and a spicy remoulade sauce. 6. Kobe sirloin- Great flavors! Super tender beef, automatically cooked medium rare. \u00a0Peach provided a sweetness, mixed with the peppery watercress, tart tomatoes and creamy ricotta. 7. Corn Salad - Good but salty. Served warm in a tea cup. \u00a0Kernels of corn, mixed with balsamic vinegar and topped with ricotta. \u00a0First bite was amazingly good. \u00a0 However, it soon was obvious that the dish was overly salted. 8. Vanilla Panna Cotta with Peaches and Lavender Trail Mix- Highly recommended! \u00a0We were beyond stuffed but had to try a dessert! \u00a0Panna cotta was ridiculously light and not too sweet. \u00a0Peaches add a fruit component and the lavender was not strong at all in the trail mix which provided great texture and crunch. 9. Tartarni Brut- Rose sparkling wine which was refreshing and crisp. Everything was appetizer size except the Basque fish stew which was an entree. \u00a0Would love to come back. \u00a0Total meal for three was $120 w/out tip included. \u00a0We were all so stuffed that we had to walk it off before hailing a cab.", "Date": "2009-09-03", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike C.", "ReviewID": "O43yaqTEv91dzXTNCuIVpg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you love bacon and all hangs bacon, run-don't walk.

YUMMO!i love oysters! especially when it's so fresh you don't need to dunk it in cocktail sauce. hehe a drop of lemon is all you need.main entrees:(we were told each entree was enough to serve family style so we shared everything. and it was more than enough.)-country ribs. it was ok. honestly, i'm not much of a pork fan. i'll eat it if it's in front of me, like anything else. i thought it was a bit dry on some ends and some of the meat by the bone was a little pink. i'm not sure if that's normal.the country ribs were topped with treviso, celery and pistachio salsa verde. that was really good. -(whole) farm chicken with frites. TO DIE! next time i come back, i'm definitely ordering this all for myself. i heard their frites are really good. and it sure as hell is!! i think everyone during dinner thought the same thing. we all had a good portion of frites before we devoured the chicken. chicken was well cooked. super juicy and bursting with flavour everytime you take a bite of it! wow. my mouth is watering just thinking about this chicken. i highly recommend this dish and you will not be disappointed.dessert:the dessert menu is limited to only three items. nothing was appealing to me. we had a choice between apple donuts, waffles or chocolate lavender pie with ice cream. i don't really like donuts and i don't really like waffles. i love chocolate so i settled for the chocolate dessert. it tasted more like caramel than lavender to me. everyone else at dinner said they could taste lavender with the after taste. me, not so much. just caramel and chocolate. i was intrigued by the description on the menu but disappointed that i could not taste lavender! :(oooh and the bathroom.i was a little weirded out again.it is a communal bathroom with a communal sink, super dim lights, no mirrors because it is inside the bathroom stalls. this weirded me out even more because i came out of the bathroom stall the same exact time as another male across from me.we both headed to the communal sink, washed our hands and everything was so sync and just plain weirddd.i think i'll avoid using the restroom during my next visit. hehemy overall experience at the publican was good. \u00a0service is great. food was

when served in a setting like the Publican. \u00a0I find the other reviews of this place to be very interesting, mostly because of how varied the criticism is, and I think that is an important thing for a restaurant in its infancy. \u00a0I hope they take it to heart, because the Publican is a really unique space with an excellent offering of menu items. \u00a0I like Publican for 4 stars (with an asterisk).Food: \u00a0I think we accidentally ordered everything on the menu (party of 8...ordering process got a little carried away, more on this in \"Service\" section). \u00a0The portions are very generous, every dish we had was the size of a standard entree at an Applebees type restaurant (please take that reference with a grain of salt)...in other words, I would not agree with reviews claiming portions to be small. \u00a0Every single item on the table (veal heart, sweetbreads, ham, oysters, skate, potee, fish fry, pork belly, rutabaga, chicken, bread, pickles..ya there was a lot of food) was delicious, with the exception of the country ribs which were dry and not very interesting. \u00a0My favorites and what I would consider a must try if on the menu: pork belly, sweetbreads, and veal heart. \u00a0The preparation of the meats in each of these was excellent, and I felt the accoutrements were very well matched (farro and pickled cherry for the heart, squash for the sweetbreads, artichokes and tomatoes for the belly).Service: \u00a0The service caused the loss of the 1 star (with an asterix). \u00a0Our waiter made me sort of angry, because he insisted that the food HAD to be shared family style, even though everyone had sort of indicated that they were planning to pair up to share a dish or two, and that we would need at least 2 dishes per person...he later recanted that statement after we each ordered 2 dishes and he told us we had ordered too much. \u00a0Inconsistent...and sort of arrogant. \u00a0It worked out in the end because we got to try everything, but it did wind up being way more expensive as a result of his recommendations/orders. \u00a0With that said, the waiters who served us at the bar were friendly, knowledgeable about the beer, and menu, and actually set us up with some discounts on the wine. \u00a0So in summation, \u00a0not sure what crawled up our waiter's butt, but on the whole, service is very professional.Beer: \u00a0The bottled beer is pretty overpriced (at least the American crafts), I can see the Belgian bottles being worth it just because of you may not be able to find them elsewhere. \u00a0The draft beers, and the wine is where its at. \u00a0I had a smoked stout which was very good with the meat items on the table, and reasonably priced. \u00a0My fiancee had an excellent white wine, and another few of our party had a malbec which they really liked.Ambiance: \u00a0Easily the best designed restaurant I have been in, it fits my style perfectly, and the pictures of the enormous pigs on the wall are a surprisingly subtle touch. \u00a0The bathrooms (namely the sinks) are also really cool...but try not to spend too much time in there...people may get the wrong idea. \u00a0My fiancee really loved the decor, the long tables, mixed flatware, ornate silverware, long old fashioned bar and textured walls. \u00a0In summation, way cool.", "Date": "2010-01-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"},

decided that every time I hit another centurion mark it will be for a restaurant in this fine city since my 100th review happened to be for a chicago place even though I'm from Pittsburgh. \u00a0 \u00a0However at #347 review for this joint I'm a little late to the party. \u00a0We were here in the summer for pretty much a chi town food tour approaching 4 or so meals a day all at different places. \u00a0It was great, however paradoxically pretty much stopped my yelping due to the fact I was getting behind already in my reviews and it was starting to seem like homework,,,okay on to the visit. \u00a0I think we arrived around 4ish on a Saturday and the place was relatively empty I'm sure due to the fact that it was so early. \u00a0It's almost like this place was built for me due to the large sign across the street \"Nealey Foods\". \u00a0I was watching an episode of \"The best thing I ever ate\",,,in fact it was the show that has me and Michael Symon at Lolita...name dropper?? \u00a0Well, Michael Symon said the best fried food he ever ate was at \"The Publican\" and it was the homemade pork rinds. \u00a0Well, that's reason enough to go to Chicago for me. \u00a0The place itself is quite modest looking and airy. \u00a0It's wood all over and large globe lights. \u00a0There are some booths and a copper bar I believe. \u00a0There are big pictures of the beautiful amimal that seems to be the focus of the restaurant. \u00a0I'm hesitant to call the beasts in the pictures pigs,,,reminds me of a saying \"pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered\". \u00a0There's a bunch of slaughtering going on here. \u00a0I ordered a wine of some type and I remember thinking the wine price reasonable. \u00a0Then we get into the meal. \u00a0Even though Annie and I weren't that hungry I

The beer menu is extensive and difficult to choose from, but they usually have a resident beer expert that can explain things to you.

While all the plates ordered were hits, some were home runs while others just singles or doubles. Meaning we did not have a bad dish amongst the many that we ordered, but there were definitely some memorable ones that will have me drooling in Boston as I think about them whenever I get a pork craving.Our server was great. She was funny and enjoyed our stupid jokes. The bus boys refilled our water glasses constantly. Apologizing each time to reach over us to fill the glasses. The food runners brought out each dish with perfect knowledge of what was on the plates. Even during a mishap of bringing us mussels we did not order was fine. \u00a0For this, I give the service a huge A+. However, I cannot forget the horribly slow service at the bar. While waiting for our table we stood in the middle of the dining room at the \"bar area\" and waited for what seemed like forever to order and receive our drinks. In fact, our table was ready before our drinks were ever brought to us. The fact that we had to wait and close out our tab with the bar waiter before being seated seemed a little odd. Couldn't that waiter bring our beers over to our table and also the tap? I guess not. So we had to stand there knowing our table was ready and our beers were still not in our hands. To make matters worse, I see 4 glasses waiting patiently at the bar to be picked up while our waiter was chatting it up with friends or whoever not even acknowledging us. For this, service at Publican gets knocked down to a B-.Located in what seems like the meat packaging district of Chicago, the restaurant is in a huge open space with large glass ball lights coming down from the ceiling every foot or so. There are large communal tables lining the entire central dining area, with a standing area for the bar patrons in the center of it all. Lined around it all along the wall are booths that have half doors on them. We were lucky enough to eat in one of these, though they were a bit confining and felt like veal pens. And just like veal, we were fed unbelievably well.We were going to order the 1/2 suckling pig but were told that it was already sold out, Paul Kahan only having 2 pigs for the entire night and was just trying out the item on the menu. Seeing as we weren't the only ones scared off by the $75 price tag, it looks like Paul will more than likely have more in stock for next Friday night. We made up for the fact of no suckling pig by ordering basically the entire pig along with some other tasty bits. Our nice server mentioned that we had no vegetables ordered, but we told her we did order the pickles...There was too much food, though we ate about 98% of all of it, to talk about, but I'll give a quick run down with the pics.Oysters: The kumamatos were as good as always and the other oysters were good as well, but there was one type that was muddy and \"tasted like poop\" as my sister said.Pickles: Our veggies for the evening...the cauliflower was surprisingly good.Sardines: This was a great plate. I really like sardines and think they are underused at restaurants.Spicy Pork Rinds: The single greatest reason to go to Publican! These were the greatest snacks ever. I love pork rinds and I have no hesitation to call these the greatest pork rings in all the known universe. We ordered 2 more of these as the night went on.Bone Marrow: We were told we got the last order of bone marrow for the night. Not sure if this was true or not, if this was to make us feel better that we didn't get the suckling pig, either way, I'm so glad we got this. Bone marrow is sooooo freaking good! People, please do not be scared off by bone marrow, if you are then you are missing one of the greatest tasting parts of an animal. This bone marrow was buttery and spread onto the bread easily. Even the bread on this plate was unbelievably delicious.Charcuterie: This plate consisted of head cheese, duck and foie gras terrine, pork pie, morteau, pickles and mustard. Some good like the pork pie and the mustard, but mainly just ok. The head cheese was surprisingly tastier than the terrine.Pork Belly: If you don't get the pork rinds and the pork belly when you come to Publican, please remove yourself from the human race. It's dishes like these that I'm glad I'm not part of a religion or a family that has beliefs like \"Do not eat pork\" because a life without pork belly has got to be freaking tough.Publican is a must try if you live in Chicago. Go get the pork rinds and pork belly for sure. There are tons of specialty beers too here, but the beer takes a big back seat to the food in my eyes. Overall, I give Publican a 4 out of 5. I'd go back just for the pork rinds alone.

My girlfriend and I went today for the brunch. We sat down, ordered some Mimosas and looked at the menu. After struggling to find something appealing, we both decided to finish the Mimosas and go somewhere else. $18 for two Mimosas and a coffee. Nothing on the menu was particularly appealing and it was all overpriced. Every time I would see something that looked moderately interesting like the pork shank, it would promptly be ruined to my tastes by the inclusion of something like kale or turnips. I suppose this is fabulous for people who really want to be adventurous, but for my tastes it was a disaster. My girlfriend completely agreed. Frankly, not only was the menu unappealing, but the Mimosas at $7 a piece were tiny and not that good. Be warned, I had predicated my visit upon viewing a previous menu that had many things that looked great like the smoked fish with bacon truffle. That sounds cool and different. Sorry, but nothing on the menu now is remotely like that. Everything was ruined by what appeared to be my mother when I was five trying to sneak in things I hated at dinner. Here son, you can eat this awesome steak if you also eat these turnips and beats I snuck in. Um, no thanks. Especially for the premium price.

great flavor, perfectly cooked, and i loved the polenta and asparagus (i wanted to ask the waitress if i could just have a plate of that). high marks on the ramps and desserts as well, in particular the waffle, mmmmmm. last but not least, the beer. i had a couple belgian and they were so crisp and fresh, very nice. overall it was a top notch dining experience, a great place to go with a group of friends (definitely not a romantic spot, since it tends to be quite noisy).", "Date": "2009-04-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Barry G.", "ReviewID": "sqnzZ09xCOe2pHyezCsmZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My business partner and I went in for a Man Date before his second baby arrives, so we figured something porky beery loud and energetic would hit the spot. \u00a0His wife mandated that we go to The Publican, so we did. \u00a0A sour red Flemish beer with dark baked bread and house pickles opened the table, and they were delicious. \u00a0We went a little overboard, with a plate of oysters, ham trio, fries with eggs, sardines, suckling pig, gem salad, duck livers and hearts, summer beans. \u00a0Foods arrived one at a time, meant for sharing. \u00a0I don't know who chose the order, but it wasn't the order we requested it, which was just fine with us. \u00a0The suckling pig was a tiny portion for $23, maybe two thin 3\" diameter slices of meat with 2-3 mushrooms in a salty buttery herb sauce. \u00a0Very tasty, but hard to tell that this was supposed to be an expensive dish. \u00a0Duck hearts and livers was even more lost, with tattered bits of liver instead of lobes or half lobes, with quartered or halved black figs, plums and citrus supremes (not pitted well either!). \u00a0The dish lacked direction, was a mess on the plate, difficult to eat (everything slid around or was too delicate to spear). \u00a0Sardines were wonderful, wrapped in grape leaves, served topped with halved grapes and pine nuts. \u00a0Ham was delicious and served with goat butter, but considering it's prepared off-site and simply served here, I can't in fairness give the restaurant points for it. \u00a0The summer beans were divine, tender without being mushy, wonderfully seasoned. \u00a0Gem salad was a salt bomb. \u00a0I get it that the place has many many beers available, but you don't have to salt me like a hole in the wall to keep me drinking the $9 beers! \u00a0Oysters were tasty, served with lemons and a mignonette, no cocktail sauce or tabasco, thankfully. \u00a0But the star of the table were the fries and pork rinds. \u00a0The fries were perfectly cooked in animal fat, as if you'd lovingly made them at home. \u00a0The egg yolk was very slightly overcooked, but still plentiful for dipping and sopping. \u00a0Ordered without the egg, the fries come with an aioli. \u00a0The only thing that would have made the fries better was a side of creamed spinach under the egg. \u00a0And now the pork rinds. \u00a0What on earth do they do to that poor pig skin to make these rinds so airy, crisp, minimally porky (sadly) and almost fat free? \u00a0It's some sort of magic. \u00a0Slightly questionable was the heavy dusting of something that resembled a spiced up cheese powder. \u00a0Every table should get an order, and then an extra order to go. \u00a0We ended with the waffle. \u00a0It waffled and was very light and airy, not too sweet or salty. \u00a0Almost palate cleansing in its simplicity. \u00a0The joint is LOUD. \u00a0Our waitress was fantastic. \u00a0Our bussers were a bit frantic and overexcited to get plates out of the way. \u00a0Yes, I would like to eat those last 5 fries, just like I wanted to eat that last $3 slice of ham! \u00a0I'll go back for a snack, but not for a meal. \u00a0We spent 2.5 hours there for $200, and still felt a bit hungry at the end. \u00a0Except for the ham, these were cheap ingredients expensively handled, and in the end that just left me feeling slightly exploited (to avoid using a two word term with first letters being R+O).", "Date": "2009-08-27", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Xinyuan W.", "ReviewID": "CNaZpoI4SsHBqw_P0lYJwA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "came here every weekend for brunch, but only really just craved the pork belly sandwich, which is absolutely delicious but not there every weekend, you have to call in advance to check.", "Date": "2012-07-09", "Author_Location": "Bronx, NY"}, {"Author": "debbie f.", "ReviewID": "2T3YTPeL-EXRRahkm9X3tA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were a group of 9 and had to wait over 2 HOURS for a table, the problem is that the system is flawed, there is no way to shuffle up the tables, we had to wait for 3 people seated in the middle to get up.

We went at 8 p.m. on a Saturday night and the place was buzzing. We were seated at a corner of the communal table and at first, we found the wine/beer list and menu a little overwhelming (we are foodies from San Francisco so this surprised us both). Enter our waiter Justin. He was awesome. We turned our food and beverage choices over to him and after some discussion over our basic likes and interest in certain menu items, he was off. We had a 2.5 hour small plate and multi-course meal perfectly paired with AMAZING beers that was FANTASTIC. I can't actually believe I wrote amazing beers in a sentence! But Justin knows the food, understands the nuances and flavors of each plate and delivered. The mussels were buttery AND briney, served with a hot crusty loaf of baguette. The frittes - out of this world. The halibut crudo melted on our tongues...the pickles! Try the \"pickles\"...the charcuterie place, the corn, the tomatoes...all delicious. I have to also mention our entire experience was helped by great support staff including Miguel. Never had to ask for water, or sit in front of a used dish. He's new to the staff there and really warm and efficient. Can't wait ti return on our next visit.
