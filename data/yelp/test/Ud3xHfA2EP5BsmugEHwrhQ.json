Not only were the courses whimsical, but the servers were entertaining as well. They playfully bantered and had fun with us throughout the night. Not stuffy at all! I can see why they're ranked as #9 in the world. Everything was spot on: service, food, plating, innovative. It was well worth the price tag- a little less than $600 for two with no drinks and 20% service fee included. \u00a0I was fortunate enough to come across an open seating for 2 when I was randomly browsing a couple months ago. The way you get reservations is different in the sense that you have to pre-purchase tickets online. Totally cuts down on no-shows. If I hadn't googled the place, I probably wouldn't have found Alinea. You enter a purple/pink-lit hallway and then a door slides open to welcome you to the restaurant. We were seated upstairs and noticed a leaf seemingly floating above us. We had no idea that said leaf would be incorporated into a course. You don't get the menu until after you finish your meal. While I had looked into the dishes, some took me by surprise. I had many favorites from black truffle explosion to the green apple taffy edible balloon to eating veal sweetbreads in a legit Chinese takeout box. I definitely think this is a must-try spot for everyone at least once in their lives. Do yourselves a favor and don't read too much about the dishes.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone but there are many surprises here although I suspect that if you are going to Alinea, you probably have done some research and already know what I am referring to. I will not go into detail as to the \"surprising presentation\" that this restaurant is known for. \u00a0All I will say is that it is perfectly executed and the \"tricks\" do not take away from the food or experience. \u00a0Before I get into the food, let me comment ever so briefly about the reservation process. \u00a0I absolutely LOVE the reservation process. \u00a0You purchase tickets online (at Alinea.Com). \u00a0You pick your timeslot and pre-pay for same. \u00a0So, by the time you get there, you are pretty much pre-paid, except of course for gratuity and, in our case, the wine pairing ($150pp). Easy, efficient... I wish many more restaurants would employ this reservation tactic.The food, overall, was excellent. \u00a0From the scallops to the lobster to the wagyu to the duck, all were perfectly executed as was the well orchestrated service. \u00a0All in all we had some 10 or so courses, inclusive of dessert. \u00a0Talking about the desserts, I didn't love them, and that includes the \"grand finale\" dessert which was great in presentation but fell well short in taste. In fact, as compared to all the other 3-Star Michelin Restaurants I have dined at, this one fell very short in the all important sweets department. We also elected for the wine pairing. Ordinarily, I am very picky of the wine I drink. So much so I take my own personal wine almost everywhere I go except Alinea does not permit customers to bring their own wine so we elected to go with the pairing. \u00a0It was better than most pairings I've had but not exceptional... \u00a0not memorable...And there is the reason for the 4 stars. \u00a0Overall a great experience with good food and pretty good although not great wine. \u00a0But even with all the originality displayed in the presentation , I didn't find this dinner to be \"perfection\" in every way.

The restaurant was busier and noiser then we've ever seen it, so was missing that serene ambience we had grown to love. A victim of it's own success? The menu wasn't our favourite as it focused on humdrum ingredients (parsnip, rhubarb?) and two of the courses that attempted to be humorous, were not elevated beyond the cheap takeaway meals they sought to imitate (sweetbreads served in a chinese takeaway box and fried smelt served on newspaper with sachets of sauce). Service was also not up to standards. We watched a waiter drop a hot potato cold potato on the table of the guest next to us, splashing them with soup, as well as pop one of the desserts. We were not welcomed back, when on previous times we were and after seeing Chef Achatz prepare one of the desserts for a table next to us, we thought he might repay our loyalty by preparing ours for once, but we were let down again. The usually comedic style of the service staff was not there and our somellier's deadpan demeanour came across as disinterested rather than wry. Still four stars though as our first dinner at Alinea was a magical five star experience with perfect service, artistic, whimsical and deliciious preparations.

All the lovely sauces paired wonderfully with the lobster.Wine pairing - Vin de pays de l'herault mas jullien 2010Sweetbreads - Orange, ginko nut, cinnamon chopsticks. This was a play on Chinese takeout. This came in a Chinese take out box wrapped in a plastic bag with cinnamon chopsticks!Wine pairing - Vrouvray tendre domaine du viking 2011Ebi - Celtuce, yuzu, sea grape. All on a kombu chip! A great little bite!Wagyu - Parsnip, black trumpet, kombu. This was brought out as a little table decor, then lit on fire. Finally revealed was a charred parsnip and wagyu!Wine pairing - Sato no homare pride of the village junnai ginjo-shu, sudo honke shuzo. Ibaraki-ken.Lily bulb - Rambutan, distillation of caviar lime. This was our palette cleanser. I wasn't a huge fan of this. The lily bulbs were a little too string and the serving was a little too much for an intermezzo.Rhubarb - Celery root, celery branch, licorice. My least favorite course of the night. There was rhubarb hanging above us the when we sat down which was shaved on top of this dish. It was too sweet and too strong. Even though the serving was small, I couldn't bring myself to finish it.Wine pairing - Matthiasson rose, california 2007Wood ear - Pig ear, allium, garlic. When they dug up the wagyu from the fire, I was actually expecting pig. We finally got some!Wine pairing - Crozes hermitage cuvee gaby domaine du colombier 2011Black truffle - Explosion, asparagus, parmesan. My favorite dish of the night! I could have eaten several of them they were so good! Our server told us this is what the chef served to his investors to convince them to invest in this restaurant. I understand why they said yes!Duck - Foie gras, morel, dragon's breath. I love to eat duck! But they kind of scare me aesthetically so the duck vessel holding the foie and dumplings was not my fav. Regardless I did enjoy this dish.Wine pairing - Ricardo esponoza antiyal valle de maipo 2010Pistachio - Mascarpone, black walnut, rose. I didn't really care for this dessert. There was a salty element in the ice cream that just ruined the whole dish for me.Wine pairing - Chateau tirecul la graviere les pins monbazillac 2011Balloon - Helium, green apple. Such a fun course! You suck out all the helium, talk like a chipmunk \u00a0and then eat the balloon and string!Milk Chocolate - Pate sucree, violet, hazelnut. I can't even describe how awesome it was to watch them make this dessert! This is definitely a treat!Wine pairing - Maculan torcolato breganze 2009I was kind of hesitant about buying the tickets for the 5p reservation since it was such an early time to have dinner, but it was cheaper so I decided to go for it.

Apologies for the tardiness as I was here in January 2014 but it's been a busy spring at work and well... if I don't work I can't afford to eat at places like this : )Alinea's decor is very plain, but the idea is to not look around but to showcase the food. It's also not very big, which is one of several reasons why it's hard to get a reservation. The ticket process is fine, but it needs to be for an even party which can result in rather awkward conversations with friends, etc if someone is the odd person out, but that's how it goes. You also pay 20% gratuity in advance. At first I was put off by this as I was concerned that the service wouldn't be good, but it was excellent.One tip I had received from a fellow yelper: don't do the wine pairings. It tends not to be the best wine. I actually wouldn't expect to drink much there but I had 2 glasses of mediocre wine which happened to be $25 each plus 20% service : )But this is a 5 star review for the food and the overall experience. The plates are small but they are beautifully presented, we started with the char roe in a little bubble glass, followed by a scallop served in the shell. As Ron Burgundy would say \"Great Merlin's beard the scallop was good\". (no jazz flute at Alinea). The dungeness crab was next and it looked by a campfire ground kinda complete with a crackling fire inthe middle of the table. What we didn't know was that some of the 'firelogs' were actually wagyu beef chunks cooking in front of us, so it was unwrapped for us in the next dish. The veal cheeks were suprisingly my favorite with the pine taste to it. As many others have mentioned we also had the hot/cold potato soup. My only complaint is that it there wasn't an option to funnel a gallon of it because it was so good. The black truffle is very good, but remember to keep your mouth closed! There was also a duck dish with about 50 different topping to choose from. very amusing. Oh and of course the apple baloon you can eat. There were a few other dishes, the dessert made on the tabletop was delicious as was the pumpkin stick. Of the 13 dishes were had, there was only one that was meh and that was the five flavor ginger.

When I finally decided to commit and attempted to buy tickets a month in advance, the restaurant was unsurprisingly sold out for the weekend I was going to be in town. It was a big weekend and people from all over were flying in for a restaurant industry trade show, myself included, so I wasn't the only one interested in dining at the one of the World's 50 Best Restaurants. Luckily, Alinea eventually also came to this realization and decided to open their restaurant the Monday following the weekend (they're normally closed on Mondays & Tuesdays). I stalked their reservation website and managed to secure a pair of tickets for 8:30 pm.The two-story restaurant is on the small side, but by no means cramped. We arrived and opened the nondescript front door to a long hot pink-lit hallway. Halfway down, sleek doors to our left slid open and a host greeted us. Even though we were 30-minutes early, we were seated immediately and I was glad we got our evening started earlier than planned. The decor is simple and understated to highlight the molecular gastronomy. Hanging above each table was a vegetable, which we thought was strange but I don't want to spoil any surprises. Let's just say every little thing, down to the details, serves a purpose.14-course Tasting Menu ($275 pp)Hot Potato, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Salsify, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Lobster, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Sweetbreads, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Ebi, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Wagyu, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Lily Bulb, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Rhubarb, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Wood Ear, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Black Truffle, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Duck, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Pistachio, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Balloon, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Chocolate Cake (Birthday), yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026Milk Chocolate, yelp.com/biz_photos/alin\u2026The courses were either a hit or miss for me. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly care for nor like most of them, especially the Ebi and Lily Bulb (I had to force this down). However, my favorites were definitely the Hot Potato, Lobster, and Wagyu as I love contrast in textures and flavors, and these three were just that. All four desserts were fantastic and so fun, especially the balloon! The presentation for all the courses, plus the added element of surprise (you don't know the menu beforehand), really made the overall meal much more unique, interactive, and memorable -- even if I didn't like all of the dishes. You truly use all your senses at Alinea.ServiceA bit uptight and to be honest, I didn't feel 100% comfortable. Our server and sommelier would stand off to the side, whisper to another, then chuckle, or share glances over our table and smirk after presenting courses to us throughout the night. Maybe it didn't have anything to do with us, maybe it did. Either way, I can't say it was the most pleasant service. They were nice, but that was it. The host should also smile more -- while I waited for the restroom and peered into the kitchen, I asked him a couple of questions about operations and Chef Achatz for the sake of conversation, but he was unfriendly, cold, and abrupt with his answers. Not the type of service I expected, especially when I'm paying this much for a meal.Michelin: 3 stars (2014)World's 50 Best: no. 9 (2014)", "Date": "2014-05-31", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Madeline B.", "ReviewID": "UNqaQDzifqx0_pq3IKqWAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alinea suggests that you arrive 15 minutes prior to your reservation. \u00a0We were about 30 minutes early. \u00a0The hostess greeted us warmly and then left us rather abruptly. \u00a0Having not been there before, it was not clear to us whether we were to wait in the bar (I don't think they have one) or by the door where were were left standing. \u00a0 Fortunately, one of the wait staff intervened and told us they could seat us immediately.The room we were in was very simple and elegant but very noisy. \u00a0There was one very loud party of six which detracted from the otherwise serene ambiance. \u00a0Everything about the restaurant is imaginative and thoughtful with incredible attention to detail. \u00a0 15 courses is a lot, not so much in quantity, but in the ability to be memorable. \u00a0I can recall 4 or 5 but would have to refer back to the printed menu keepsake (nice touch) to jog my memory. \u00a0 \u00a0There were only a couple of things I didn't find completely delicious. 1. \u00a0The raviolo was too salty.2. \u00a0Impressive that you can make a noodle out of bubble gum but I don't need to eat it.The service was impeccable, warm, engaging and friendly. \u00a0We could not have asked for more.Except for the noisy party in the dining room with us, it was a wonderful experience. \u00a0At approx. $1700 for 4, it's probably one I never have to have again.", "Date": "2014-06-08", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Lisa S.", "ReviewID": "uwmT0etHgX3oJNoilN4-7g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alinea has spoiled me for life. \u00a0I can't help but compare other \"nice\" restaurants to Alinea and no one yet can match the creativity or complexity.

I'm 30 years old, I didn't die, no one else died at my expense (I'm 98% sure that's an accurate statement)... \"much success\", as that kooky internet meme dog would say (bit.ly/1gW3jCQ). I don't feel a day over 12, but it's still weird to think that I'm the age my parents were when they were already married for 5 years, owned a house, and had two screaming brats to look after. Me? I'm not married, never engaged, own nothing of value, and kids... well, I once asked a doctor if it were possible to cauterize my fallopian tubes, so don't hold your breath on that one. Arrested development might as well be my middle name, but after dining at Alinea (named World's Best Restaurant by the 1% and some other publications), I feel like I can mark this down as one of my few but fierce lifetime milestones.Expectations: I had them... and they were met. Exceeded? Debatable. I know what that makes me sound like, but hear me out. Maybe I'm still the same brat I was born as 30 years ago, but maybe I'm on to something. I have no doubt as to Grant Achatz's talent. That's just a universal truth and dining at Alinea is indeed an experience. Duh. And I'm sure Chef Achatz's will sleep much sound-er tonight knowing some jerk from the suburbs is confident he's got talent, BUT... (and I know I sound crazy) if you're going to be dining at this caliber and this price point I know a place that does it better. Maybe it's unfair to outright compare in my review of Alinea, but I feel like it's important to know if you're only going to dine at one destination of this sort that Grace Restaurant (bit.ly/1klQGiG) really had the edge on almost every course, with the only exception being dessert. Both are exceptional, but in a one-for-one comparison, both my Dad (who was my gracious dining partner and meal ticket) and I would rate Grace above both Alinea and NEXT. It's the under-dog Alinea of Chicago, but without Alinea proper, there would likely be no place for the likes of Grace. And that's where I'll leave the comparison part of this review and decide on 5-stars overall as tribute. Alinea paves the way for future Chefs.With that being said, the meal while being experienced was exquisite. The meal in hindsight had me re-thinking. The menus change seasonally and the Alinea team is consistently reinventing the way we think of food, but I just have a hard time believing that the late March 2014 menu is Alinea's shining best. I know I'm not well versed in finer things and that I'd have a harder time passing as a classy human than I would passing for a cyborg, but when describing the most memorable parts of our meal, a part of me had to wonder if the joke was on us. Here's why:// One of the courses was basically Chinese food left-overs with fancy ingredients. I respect what was done and the uniqueness of what went into the dish, but at the end of the day, it still tasted like decent Chinese food and it was served in the same white Chinese food take-out containers you'd eat out of while on your couch watching your favorite guilty pleasure in your PJs. The dish was even sitting on a wadded up 'Thank you! Enjoy!' plastic bag. // Another course was fish butts (which I actually love, in real life) with condiment packets on old newspaper obituaries and comics. And another table of all men got tall boys of PBR to pair with this course. Of course not all courses were like that, but of the 15 that came out, those were two of them and in the end that's a decent portion of the entire meal being wavering on the gimmicky side. Maybe it's fun for the 1% to eat like the rest of us do 6 out of 7 nights of the week, but I'm still not entirely sure it wasn't us all being made a fool of in the 'The Emperor's New Clothes' style way. \u00a0I think my favorite course was the Char Roe with banana, ginger, passion fruit and also Branch Camouflage that looked and tasted like beef jerky (that should give you idea of how refined my palate is not). The dessert was also spectacular and if you're lucky enough Chef Grant Achatz will be the one preparing it table-side for you. The decor in our dining room (2nd floor, street-side) was pretty meh for me. I think that's how it's supposed to be so you're not distracted from the food, but to me it just kind of comes off as semi-decorated hotel conference room. Again, I have no class and not a ton of experience in 'finer things', so maybe that's how fancy pants people prefer dining, but to me it was too plain-face and I would've killed for a little music.At the end of the day I'm 30 and elated to even have had the opportunity to write this review. Chef Achatz paved the way for so many and while I didn't *love* this reincarnation of the menu or the stiff atmosphere, Alinea is still world-class and changing the way we look at food and the measures it can be taken to.

You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and Alinea shows you how deep the rabbit hole goes.I'm fine arguing that it's the best meal I've ever had--better than French Laundry, than L'Atelier, and all the other Michelin and non-Michelin experiences I've had in my life. It's that good.It starts with the service, which is not only first-rate, but--even more importantly--extremely comfortable. A charming conversation can be had. Like Rusty tells Linus, they've got to like you then forget you the moment you've left their side. Apt advice for a waiter, and followed to a T by the fine folks at Alinea.The wine pairings. Yes. Healthy pours all, and they gave me \"just a splash\" three times. I think I was on cloud nine by course six.Anyways, the food. Amazing, yet accessible. Fancy, yet playful. Delicious, yet really, really, good golly miss molly, delicious. Should I go through? Let's go through.The osetra amuse-bouche reminded me of a Robuchon special. I knew things were looking good when I saw, and subsequently tasted, the lime foam. The next two appetizers were arguably my favorites. The scallop--closed in shell--required all five senses. If you're wondering on the sound, there was a babbling brook sound under a bed of seaweed. The scallop and Peruvian influenced sauce was mind-bogglingly good. The third of the apps was a stuffed shrimp head. As Anthony Bourdain says, if you don't like what's in a shrimp head, we can't be friends.As if playfulness weren't already a huge factor, the one-two punch of a lobster campfire, followed by revealing said campfire as a wagyu-(or tuna)-parsnip makeshift barbacoa, was ingenious. And tasty. My second experience with sweetbreads went better than the first, probably putting me back in the good graces if Bourdain knew who I was. And a hot potato, cold potato sidebar set us up for the wham bam dish known only as ????....!!!!! (and etc., so forth) on the menu. It's duck four ways (turbot for her), served with 60 spices, additives, and accoutrements, which become more fun to taste than the duck itself.Onto dessert, and a ginger five ways bested the duck's four, but not the supplemental 60. I'm from Missouri on sweetbreads, but I actively dislike pumpkin. I may have been converted yet again by Alinea's pumpkin sticky on a stick, for lack of any other better term. That was followed by a pistachio gelato, perhaps the only dish I didn't thoroughly fancy. I could've sucked the complementing marscapone dry, though.As if three desserts weren't enough, the infamous balloon had yet to make its appearance. It finally did, and it was sticky, amusing, and infused with a tart green apple taste that reminded me of elementary school wonder. Oh, and so did the helium sucking. Or maybe that was my college years. Whatever the case may be. The final canvas dessert of chocolate was pure overkill, and turned out to be the only dish we didn't ravenously devour. We left half that sucker, in a bigger mess than it first came.Stomachs satiated. Brain entertained. Bodies warmed. Hearts happy.

The reservation system is really nice because, even though it's pricy, you've already pre-paid for your dinner and thus feel less stressed about the money part once you're there. The only thing you add on when you're there is drink pairings. The entire experience is simply phenomenal, and it's really a place where you should think of it as an event rather than just a dinner. What I loved most is that it wasn't super pretentious. Yes, you dress nicely and it's a fancy restaurant. But, it's not stuffy. There are comfortable chairs and nice wood tables. But there aren't white tablecloths and dim lighting. I would describe it as having a modern flair with a very clean look. There are also very few tables in the room, so it feels more private.For the drink pairings, I really liked that you could split a pairing between yourselves and thus only pay for one pairing. That way, you can both taste the drinks that they recommend with your food but not feel like you're breaking the bank (for people that are more money conscious). As for the food, it was simply spectacular! With so many small dishes, the worry is that you'll leave here still hungry. But, that's anything but the truth. The dishes are spaced out perfectly and timed to your eating style, so it's great because you are never waiting too long, and you end up leaving stuffed. Each dish is also its own little experience, so make sure to savor every moment. If at all possible, don't pay attention to the other tables!

I know, I know. I'm usually the first one that just has to know what to always expect. The thing is, Alinea's entire concept works best when you EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED: a concept they expertly implement. My only suggestion is to look up what the building exterior looks like (or you might miss it). Other than that, don't ruin it. I'm warning you. Stop. Look away. For the rest of you, I still won't spoil it completely. I refuse to. Arrived promptly at 9:30pm. \u00a0The building is unmarked. No name. No clue. We entered into a mauve tunnel and about 6 steps in, magic doors opened unexpectedly into the unknown. We spotted the hostess and cheerfully greeted her. She stared us down and after an awkward 6-7 second pause she announced \"We were expecting you an hour ago.\" Shit. What was she talking about? Turns out, she was correct. I doubted her at first because I am a sticklet for reservations. Alas, once I checked my confirmation e-mai, I saw she was correct. \"We will still be able to honor your reservation\", she finally (and icily) said. My heart sunk. I waited for this reservation for over a month! I would have been so sad had we left then. I'm not sure why we confused the times. I apologized, but she was not caving. We were escorted up to our table on the 2nd floor. One of our (many) waiters came by and assured us it was OK (despite the last seating being then). Thankfully, everything was smooth sailing from then on.Our dinner was pre-paid. We purchased \"tickets\" online instead of reserving the traditional way. They do things differently here. (TIP: Follow them on Facebook/Twitter. They always announce when the tickets are on sale and you have a better chance at snagging a reservation.) The dinner consisted of 13 small courses. You have to know that almost everything at Alinea has a surprise factor. The attention to detail is astounding. Everything has a purpose: every plate, utensil, setting, etc.. Once there, we decided to add the wine pairing to our dinner as well. Although I did not love every single pairing (as in, I would never have it outside of Alinea), each one paired perfectly with its course. My favorites were the Selbach-Oster Riesling Kabinett (surprisingly so), the Sato No Homare Sake, and the Chateau Tirecul a Graviere.Without giving all the details away, I will say that my favorite courses were the scallops, lobster, wagyu, hot potato, and duck. Those were ALL delicious! My least favorites were the pistachio dessert and lily bulbs. Yes, I ate flowers. I also inhaled helium, and had a course called \" ........?????............!!!!!!!!!!!!! \" . I laughed, I mmm'd and had a memorable night. For the skeptics (like me), this was surprisingly enjoyable. I'm usually not a fan of gimmicky restaurants. I can even go as far as compare this to a similar one I recently dined at (and another 3 Michelin Star one) which I detested: you can read about it here: yelp.com/biz/the-restaur\u2026 While Meadowood left me mentally and physically starved, Alinea did not. Are you going to roll out of there stuffed? Probably not! You will, however, leave there satisfied and with a better understanding of high end cuisine and it's intricate techniques. I am so humbled I was able to experience it and feel like a better diner now because of it. Service was wonderful. I will say this too: do not dine at Alinea if you don't have a sense of humor and an understanding of sarcasm. With the exception of our frowning hostess, the staff was ALL witty, sharp, focused, professional and full of one liners. It worked beautifully with our party. It also works flawlessly with this kind of food where delivery and presentation are key factors! I would love to be a fly on the wall during the hiring and training process. Do they train them at the Improv? I lost count on how many waiters we had all night for each course. I saw at least 9 different ones who presented a course and interacted with us. I was actually sad when I realized it was over. I felt like it should have been 2 courses longer. I hesitantly pushed my chair back and left. Unfortunately, Alinea is not the kind of place you can return to immediately. I would think you need to let some time pass and wait for them to switch their menu around. I do plan to hopefully return in a couple of years. Next time though, I will triple confirm my reservation time. I wouldn't want to get the death stare from that hostess again. Ha! I kid.

Eye-opening? si. Surprising? yes. Tasty? oui. Amusing? definitely. Cool? fo shiz. I did Next and Alinea back to back this past weekend (Bocuse d'Or at Next). \u00a0Definitely thought Alinea was better. I guess if you have the same menu for more than 4 months, you continually refine on it ;)Also, I personally find it funny that Alinea sells a cook book. Should just be a scratch-n-sniff picture book.

We enjoy dining at nice establishments and have been to many in New York, Las Vegas, and Chicago. I considered Alinea the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of molecular gastronomy and could not wait to try this place. After experiencing our meal here I would have to say that this is surely a once in a lifetime experience. I say this in a positive and negative way. The experience you will have here is like no other but it does come with a hefty price, that many will likely not be able to repeat. Hence, the once in a lifetime phrase. The restaurant is not very well labeled and you could easily miss it if you didn't know where you were going. When we arrived there were two people out front acting as host and hostess to confirm your reservation, and likely to tell someone on the inside of your arrival via Ipad. She then asked us to enter through a door and down a small corridor lined with flowers contained in small vases. Some of these flowers were made from paper towels and contained a small bite of cotton candy. You then walked down the corridor until you come upon a Star Trek type door opens up leading you into the restaurant. You are then led to your table where you are greeted by your server to take your drink order and offer you wine pairing, a regular pairing and a reserve pairing. I won't get into the dishes because there are just too many to name but you can be sure that they are each well thought out and presented. Our only problem with the dishes is that some lacked a little with flavor. I was thinking if there was too much thought that went into the presentation of the dishes at the expense of taste. Given the amount of money the meal costs, I expect that this should have been perfected and expect to be blown away with presentation as well as taste. The meal takes a good 2.5-3 hours so don't plan much afterwards. The dessert at the end was also a nice unique way to end the night and made you feel like a kid again. Chef Achatz was not there the night we were and was at their sister restaurant Next. Not sure if this has anything to do with the quality of the food that evening. All in all it was an experience to be had and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it but given the hefty price, I'm not sure if we will be making a repeat appearance.", "Date": "2013-10-02", "Author_Location": "Gilbert, AZ"}, {"Author": "Albert K.", "ReviewID": "8XC6g17IBOuHNBmAOR4vwA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience that I would recommend people to try, provided that you have the budget.

The problems started when a dish arrived which contained cilantro, my wife has a horrible reaction to cilantro and nothing taste right to her after she eats even just a small bite. \u00a0I called one of the numerous servers that waited on us that night to explain the problem, she was very understanding and whisked both our dishes away, in a short time she brought back one plate with out cilantro for my wife and mine with the cilantro how it was meant to be served, perfectly handled. We where enjoying our meal and another course arrived that again contained cilantro. not just a sprig but many tiny pieces of micro cilantro sprinkled liberally over the top of the dish. I again called one of our servers over and told him about the problem, this was a different person then helped correct the problem the first time. I was shocked to hear him say its only a garnish you can pick it off. \u00a0I started to speak up and my wife who hates any kind of scene said its fine ill just pick it off. I did not want to ruin the mood and great time we where having on this special dinner so we continued on with our dining adventure. It is crazy that a restaurant of this caliber and price tells you to remove something you can't eat yourself. How are we to know the cilantro does not go deeper in the dish. The request for cilantro should of been noted after the first incident and never made it onto my wife's plate again. Numerous times we dinned at restaurants from upscale to very modest and cilantro had shown up on a dish but was not listed on the menu and the server gladly took the dish remade it and brought it back. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the one server who told us to pick off the cilantro was the weakest link effecting the entire chain. We went on with our meal and at the end of the night were given a menu, a nice touch that would make it easy to recall the courses we ate as there was so many. Not until we arrived home did we see we where not served a course, The Butterscotch Bacon Course and the accompanying wine pairing!!! How could we have not noticed this we had dreamed of this dish since we heard of Alinea. Both my wife and I are bacon lovers and looked so forward to it. I guess we where overwhelmed with so many courses and the magical celebration. It bothered me so much I had to write a letter to Alinea. I told them of the issue with the cilantro and the missing bacon course that we had dreamed of. Six weeks had passed so I called to see if they received the letter. After being on hold a while I was told yes they had the letter but the person who would be in charge of this type of problem was out of the country for a while. Really so they can't deal with it thru email or better yet delegate it to someone else or at a minimum tell use they received the letter and that they would get back to us instead of making us chase them down. So I waited and maybe another month passed and no word so I called again. At this point I was so appalled at Alineas follow up and customer service to a issue like this it made me feel taken advantage of, like they did not value our business or thought they where to good to have to deal with the problem. All the wonderful reviews and accolades who cares about one regular guy if he has a problem. Well finally about 3 months after I wrote the letter did I received a response. They said they where sorry they strive to be better and appreciate us letting them know about the issues and apologize for the problem. They summed it up by saying \u00a0they hope to get the chance to make it up to us. \u00a0Seriously, I don't go out to dinners like this more then maybe ONCE in my life. It's not like I just will stroll in on my walk home and grab a quick bite. So here is how I look at it, the cilantro was a error I can forgive but the missed course is not. If I went to the grocery store and bought a dozen eggs and when I arrived home and saw there was only 11 eggs the grocery store would give me the missing egg, and probably say here is a new whole dozen for your inconvenience. So what should of Alinea done? They should of given me my missing egg that's all they had to do, before service if they would of invited us in and served us the missing bacon course and the wine pairing I would not be harboring 5 years of ill feelings about such a special night.", "Date": "2014-02-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "David P.", "ReviewID": "K11sm4jO-_g3TPqLE-kH1g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One quote comes to mind after having eaten at both Alinea (2013) and The French Laundry (2010) even though I know Chefs Achatz and Keller are friends:\"When I left you, I was but the learner; now *I* am the master.\" (Geeky I know, but I just couldn't resist.)

And with that, I'd like to take you through my magical journey to Alinea from beginning to end. The 14-course vegan meal started off with a delightful cucumber bite.Course number two was an unusual salad made with celery root, cherry blossom, smoke, edamame, and wasabi. Course number three was really when the \"wow\" factor began. As they pulled the cover off the dish, smoke from liquid nitrogen spilled out all over the table creating a misty effect as they exposed an entree made of hollowed out green papaya with lemongrass, citrus aromas, and \"14 textures.\" They never really revealed everything in any dish. But the white powdery stuff that had been frozen with nitrogen was made of kelp, coconut, and sea salt and had an amazing oceany taste. Now, we were impressed.Next, they presented a squash blossom that had been flattened and deep fried so that it looked like a leaf served with cauliflower puffs, saffron sauce, and cotton candy. This small, yet mighty dish presented a taste explosion.Course number five was when fire was introduced as they brought out a slate of four bites inspired by Tokyo with Binchotan, Japanese charcoal, ignited on the opposite end. This was a dramatic presentation for a sumptuous dish. The four bites were bok choy, watermelon, daikon radish, and rutabaga. \u00a0Everything was complex and delicious and although we weren't sure exactly what all the ingredients or flavors were, we knew we were experiencing a culinary journey of a magnitude not yet experienced by either of us. Course number six had many flavors. There were chanterelle mushrooms in lapsang souchong, a tea whose leaves are dried over smoky pine fire. On the other side of the bowl was a hazelnut crumble with a white cracker and across from that was a white sesame foam with radish. As an added touch, there were pine needles under the bowl to help express the aroma of pine that we experienced while enjoying the dish, going back to Chef's emphasis on aromas.Course number seven was called \"Hot Potato, Cold Potato.\" This one arrived suspended and required us to pull the little metal prong, which allowed the cold potato to fall into the hot black truffle soup and become a hot potato. On top was a sliver of black truffle and a sliver of chive. So amazing. Course number eight was pretty astonishing and was merely marked as \"Fennel...?????.....!!!!!!!!\" on the menu. This is because there is not enough room to describe this dish. First, we were presented with a plate of five vegetable-based items: salsify, beet, fennel, leek, and parsnip. Then, we were presented with 60 garnishes of which we were advised not to consume them all. We had to randomly choose garnishes to eat with our five main veggies. Wow! This was the most beautiful, astonishing exhibit of food as artwork that I had ever seen. This course was a lot of fun.Course number nine was a chiffonade of romaine lettuce served with black truffle. I think I sunk into heaven at this point.I should take a moment to mention how exquisite the service was at Alinea. From the servers to the many sommeliers, they were as attentive and as knowledgeable as they could be. The service truly was top-notch.Next up, ginger with five other flavors. The five flavors were ginger, galangal, blue ginger, turmeric, white ginger, and yellow ginger. These tiny bites were suspended on one of the Crucial Detail pieces made exclusively for this restaurant. It's all in the details. We loved the Madeira paired with this dish.Course number eleven was the one I had been waiting for all night -- the BALLOON. Yes, my friends, they make an edible balloon. It is vegan and it's spectacular. Made of green apple taffy, it is filled with helium and finished off with a cord made also of green apple taffy. A-m-a-z-i-n-g. You put your face up to it, suck a hole in the balloon, and suck the helium out all while laughing with a crazy helium-toned laugh. It was so fun!Now the sweet courses. Course number twelve was inventive, beautiful, and delicious. It was made with strawberries frozen with liquid nitrogen, sassafras, pine nuts, and sorrel leaves. Course number thirteen was a drink made of rasberry that we drank through glass tubes that had rose gel and lemon balm inside them. This was so rich.Lastly, yet another anticipated course. They put a special tablecloth down and covered it with all of the components of the dessert - no dishes needed. The end result was an artistic culinary masterpiece of pate sucree, filled with chocolate and topped with hazelnut dust, violet, and dehydrated basil. Incredibly rich and perfect in every way.

Every restaurant makes money by turning tables. Alinea makes money by pre-selling seats and does not allow refunds. (Stuff) happens, however. \u00a0Parents of a young child cannot find a babysitter and are forced to bring him. $210 + tax, tip and wine times two is A LOT of money. My original dining partner became ill the night before our reservation. I called the next day to see if rescheduling was a possibility. It was not, and yes, I was aware of refunds/rescheduling not being possible. Tough luck, I suppose. This is an issue that should be addressed. The French Laundry has a $100 deposit.Enough ranting; onto why people go there. Entering the door I immediately smelled anise. It was pleasant. I don't want to give too much info, there are a lot of surprises throughout your dining experience. \u00a0I brought a bottle of wine along, not to be opened but was hoping Chef Achatz was in and able to sign it. It was a bottle where he was an assistant wine maker at La Jota in Napa Valley. He did sign it and I was extremely thankful for it. \u00a0 \u00a0My guest and I were seated upstairs and were warmly welcomed. Not giving away too much, the decor looked like a high end lounge in the Star Trek universe. I had let a service representative know that I had a food allergy after \"buying tickets.\" The initial server acknowledged my food allergy and let me know that they would accommodate me. \u00a0We were asked if we wanted wine. I was reluctant. I am a wine snob, but I really didn't feel like spending more coin than I already have for this experience. Onto the food!We started with an amuse bouche of ARCTIC CHAR ROE, banana pudding, passion fruit foam and ginger. \u00a0My bouche was amused. \u00a0Highly flavorful, lots of textures and everything in balance. \u00a0Great start.Next a SCALLOP dish served amazingly that involved all of our senses. It was a beautiful dish that I shouldn't spoil for anNext was LOBSTER with curry, an intense Earl Grey syrup and grapefruit. The curry was awesome and ended up bringing some home with me as it ended up on my shirt. Super tasty dish.At this point in the meal I wondered if we were getting the oyster leaf that I've read a lot of amazing reviews. It didn't come. Huge bummer.Next was WAGYU with parsnip, black trumpet and kombu. I won't spoil how this was presented. \u00a0It was a gorgeous, flavorful and extremely memorable. As much as I liked it, I don't think Wagyu, in general is worth its weight. I had properly cooked A11 grade Wagyu at L2O a couple of years ago, and it was underwhelming.SWEETBREADS done in the style of Orange Chicken was next. This was an excellent dish with intense orange and mustard flavors. There was also a black garlic jus that was mouth coating and rich. Awesome dish.HOT POTATO: Playful showcase of contrasting temperatures in a dish. It was a nifty presentation that was full of truffled goodness. \u00a0DUCK: Here is where things got crazy tasty. 5 different preparations for duck with 60 different accompaniments.There was anything from olives to a port wine reduction to a menthol jelly. Lots of odd combos and many worked well. The foie gras pate was probably the most memorable bite of the evening.GINGER: A palate cleanser, very flavorful, refreshing, spicy and enjoyable. And I don't like ginger that much.At this point I was concerned about not getting the Truffle Explosion that I've read many reviews on. Another gigantic disappointment. \u00a0PUMPKIN: I wasn't sad too long after the first dessert dish. This was nearly on par with coffee and doughnuts from the French Laundry. Unctuous, not overly sweet and another awesome bite. \u00a0PISTACHIO: Served with toasted pistachios, pistachio gelato, black walnut cake, mascarpone and STRAWBERRY something. The black walnut cake was floral and very surprising. The pistachio components were absolutely awesome. \u00a0I saw the strawberry component on the plate, I'm not sure if it was meringue or what. I did explain that it was the seeds I was allergic to. Once the plate arrived, they did not say, \"hey, this doesn't have strawberry seeds in it, dig in!\" This dish was awesome without trying the strawberry anyway. \u00a0BALLOON: A green apple balloon with an edible string floated to our table. It was good, not great. \u00a0Think green apple Laffy Taffy. \u00a0MILK CHOCOLATE: Chef Achatz assembled an edible masterpiece in front of my guest and I. Hot chocolate, butterscotch, a cracker crust, hazelnut, violet syrup and frozen milk finished our meal. The hot chocolate was good, not as pleasant as everything else was. While he was making the dessert, I wanted to thank him for an excellent meal, but I fangirled and failed to say a word to him. Is Alinea the best meal I've had? No. $280 per person without wine for was not worth the coin. Flavors were amazing. Service was nearly flawless, warm and friendly. \u00a0It was an epic meal, but probably won't be returning. \u00a0'", "Date": "2014-02-08", "Author_Location": "Naperville, IL"}, {"Author": "Leah G.", "ReviewID": "YEuh23qWrCD9TuDtmzf9yw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I appreciate the creativity, but see a lot of this becoming more of a fad.

The cherry blossom had a gentle aromatic sweetness against the peppery radish and heat of the wasabi. This was also by far my favourite wine of the evening- bright, slightly sweet with a nice balance of acidity. Scallop with Citrus Aroma, and Fourteen TexturesFritz Haag 'Brauneberger' Riesling Kabinette, Mosel, 2010.-One of my favourite dishes of the night, it arrived as a caldron of seaweed bubbling and smoking from dry ice, upon which a stunning scallop shell was waiting to be opened. The scallop inside was perfectly cooked, sitting atop a pool of citrus orbs and garnished with something frozen by liquid nitrogen, giving it an interesting Styrofoam-like chew (in a really good way). There was also a little chili in there which created a really unique temperature sensation in my mouth- the scallop and everything inside it was smoking ice cold, yet the chili made my tongue tingle with every bite. Really pleasant.Artichoke with Octopus, Eggplant and AlliumLopez de Heredia 'Vina Gravonia' Blanco, Rioja 2003-This was probably my least favourite dish of the evening. I could have licked the plate clean of the Jerusalem artichoke puree and the perfectly caramelized pieces, but I found the octopus a little overcooked and chewy for me. I actually heard another table say the same thing after us.Bincho Tan with Tokyo InspirationTakatejin Junmal Daiginjo-shu 'Soul of the Sensei' Doi Shuzo, Shizuoka-ken Hitachino Nest White Ale, Kluchi Brewery-A very interesting presentation- this one arrived as a block of wood set ablaze with three unique elements- a deep fried shrimp head, a piece of pork belly and a beautiful square of raw beef. While I wasn't quite able to escape the overwhelming fattiness of the pork (which is beautiful when seared crispy, but a little off-putting when not), the beef was packed with so much rich marbled flavour that literally melted upon hitting my tongue.Veal Cheeks & Crispy Sweetbreads with Spring BountyEyrie 'Estate' Pinot Noir Willamette Valley 2010-A masterpiece of textures- I loved the fatty tender cheeks against the light and crispy fried sweetbreads, and that all of the otherwise rich flavours on the plate were tempered by the beautifully prepared spring vegetables.Hot Potato with Cold Potato, Black Truffle & Butter SoupEyrie 'Estate' Pinot Noir Willamette Valley 2010- A \"time sensitive\" dish, as the server explained- this dish required that we hold the dish carefully in our hand, remove the metal pick and allow the potato and butter to drop into the cold potato soup before taking it all down in a single bite. The result was an explosion of umami-rich truffle and comforting carbohydrate delight in a single two-temp bite.Duck Five Ways with 60 DIY Flavour AccoutrementsChateau Musar, Bekaa Valley Lebanon 2004- You would think for $250+ that we wouldn't have to play chef, but this was part of the fun. The way this worked was that we were given the flavour \"palate\" of 60 appropriate accompaniments to pair with any of the five duck preparations including parts like the breast, and foie. We were not told what anything was, but rather to select any two to smear on top of the bird and to simply use our instincts and senses- everything should work well. My favourite combo of the night? Caramelized banana and candied pecan on foie gras. Least favourite? Mint gelee and broccoli on rillettes. Yikes. Black Truffle Explosion Ravioli with Romaine and ParmesenChateau Musar, Bekaa Valley Lebanon 2004- Another dish with specific eating instructions. This one was served in a spoon that we were to bite down on making sure to keep our mouth closed. Why the insistence on chewing with our mouths closed? Well, unlike a traditional solid food ravioli, this one was packed with a light black truffle scented mildly salty broth that literally exploded into every corner of my mouth upon bursting. It was damn good. Ginger Palate Cleanser TastingThe Rare Wine Co. 'Boston Bual- Special Reserve' Madeira-A very satisfying way to acknowledge the divide between savoury and sweet- each little tiny bite of ginger took on a different flavour profile, that while all equipped with a pretty serious kick of heat, ranged from quite savoury to more sweet.Green Apple Helium Balloon The Rare Wine Co.

Napkins were twisted into flowers and nestled among tropical blooms. Each napkin contained a tuft of passion fruit cotton candy. We were instructed to take a napkin and eat the cotton candy as we entered the restaurant. Next, we were led up a clear staircase to one of the dining rooms (there were three upstairs and at least one downstairs).Osetra Cavier. I can't tell you much about the cavier, but there was a marble sized ball of butter that was crispy on the outside and exploded into liquid butter goodness that flowed amongst the delighted tastebuds in my mouth.Hot Potato. It was a shocking combination of hot and cold. Incredibly rich and indulgent. We both loved it.Black Truffle. It was a ravioli that encased liquid. As you bit into the ravioli pouch the liquid poured out in your mouth.Tuna Tartar. At least I think it was tuna tartar, but the best we've ever had in our lives. There isn't anything on our menu (that was given to us at the end) that seems to describe what we had.Okay:The service was really not that impressive. I expected it to be more attentive and personable based upon other Yelp reviews. We tried to engage our multiple servers but they seemed much more focused upon delivering and explaining our food than creating any sort of impression. I was incredibly cold for most of the meal to the point where I had goose bumps on my bare arms. I often hugged myself for warmth and snuggled back into the cuddly embrace of my chair. If the service was SO attentive I would have expected someone to at least acknowledge my discomfort.Besides, they even forgot to tell us about one of our dishes. In fact, we didn't even notice it was already at our table when we were seated. There were two tall vases of flowers and sticks. At the top were bowls of tuna tartar (described earlier in this review). After we were already served several courses, a server told us not to forget about it. We were like, forget about what? And that's when he pointed to the tall vases of flowers with the bowls on top.The price of everything was expensive. M went in expecting it to be a rip off and came away instead thinking that it was just expensive. Our total bill came to $827.42 for the two of us, wine pairing for just M (not me), a glass of champagne, and a cup of tea for me. Even while we were at the restaurant we thought about other things we could have done with that money. We discussed how there were less expensive restaurants that have delivered dishes that were 100% delicious and service that set the bar. For $827.42 Alinea should have KNOWN that our expectations were high. In the end, we came away only loving three of our 20 courses.Speaking of the 20 courses, I wouldn't have counted them the same way that Alinea did. They counted every dish as its own course. Some dishes were actually served at the same time and I would have counted that all as one course. Furthermore, I wouldn't have counted the tuft of cotton candy as we walked in to be a course.We were surprised that there were large groups of business people who didn't seem to understand the reputation of Alinea. Also, there were a couple parents who came with high school and college age children. It was just really weird to be at such an expensive and reputable restaurant with people who might not appreciate that expense.Alinea certainly was not the best restaurant I've ever experienced.

Using flash, moving around to get different people in the picture, and taking pictures OF THE WAITERS WHILE THEY ARE EXPLAINING YOUR COURSE does not fall under the category of good picture-taking-ettiquette. I feel like someone would have tactfully said something to these people at other restaurants in this price range. -The vagueness surrounding the drink pairings.

Not wanting to put up a fight or do something \"wrong,\" I agreed to full pairings, but my dinner partner still insisted on \"small pours.\" They poured the same amounts for both of us, but charged her $50 less when the bill came.

I felt like the meal was held in a good friends' house. Everyone was warm, sincere and helpful.If I'm being super picky: A lot of the dishes tasted really salty to me. I know salt taste is a personal preference but many of the them were a bit on the salty side. Additionally, I wouldn't do the wine pairing again. Unless you're very adventurous with wine, I'm not sure you'd appreciate all of the different wines, which I admit I like different wines but not to that extreme. It was cool learning all about the different wines and I liked the variety of wine and different location of the wines (they were all from different European countries) but to me, it wasn't worth the money. Although I know this is never going to happen, it would be cool to make each table separate from every other table so that if the table by you is ahead of you, no surprises are ruined.

I don't know how they're trying to cover this up, but this seriously needs to be addressed. \u00a0Here it is again.**Where do I begin? \u00a0A little background about me is that I've been to several Michelin recommended, 1 star and 2 star Michelin restaurants around the world, some at chef's table experiences, so I was very excited coming to this Three Star Michelin restaurant as I have never been to one with this standing before.I've read plenty of reviews on this site and saw several low ratings and disregarded them as oddities. \u00a0However, after being there myself this past week I would have to agree with all the low ratings.I will sound like an egotistical food snob, but I have to believe that people who gave Alinea 5 stars were dazzled by their presentation and were either tricked into believing what they ate was in fact a delicious meal or had to lie to themselves to justify the price.I will go into my experience at Alinea from the beginning. \u00a0First the ambiance.Everything about Alinea screamed a great attention to detail. \u00a0From the moment of finding their \"hidden\" restaurant as I saw no bright sign to indicate it's location to the heavy front door that gave the feeling of exclusivity, to the automatic sliding door in the foyer giving it a contemporary feel, I have to give Alinea's presentation a good score. \u00a0Some failures in feel however were the chairs. \u00a0Though the chair was comfortable, it's structure was reclined and the cushion was not firm, but rather let me sink in, making me have to lean back. \u00a0I found that it was quite uncomfortable while eating. \u00a0Now before everyone think's it's because I'm overweight, I'm not. \u00a0I am a 154 pounds 5'8\" male. \u00a0For a 2-3 hour 13 course meal, this is a very big negative. \u00a0Another failure is the table placement. \u00a0Due to some of the courses having strong scents, it was quite clumsy of their design to seat people so close to each other. \u00a0I felt that it interfered with my personal experience. (again before people start their raving, you must understand that this is a THREE Star Michelin restaurant experience. \u00a0Where all aspects of the culinary skills are being appreciated.)Second their service.The service at Alinea was quite excellent. \u00a0The Doorman was prompt, the entry host took my party's coats asked if we would need a cab at the end of the dinner and seated us politely and efficiently. \u00a0We were greeted at our table and received an explanation of the night and wine pairing choices. \u00a0Throughout the night we received ample attention without being smothered, which is always a fine balance. \u00a0I would give Alinea an excellent rating on service.Third the food.I'll break this down to several parts and be brief.visual:Visually Alinea's presentation is very good. \u00a0Some of the dishes are plated in a stunning fashion that I feel are there to distract you, but yes I admit that the presentation was very good.Smell:It was a hit or miss depending on what my neighbors were having. \u00a0Seriously, tables were so close that I was able to converse with them.Taste:OK, so this is the most important component in my opinion. \u00a0Everything else is to set the mood for this moment...and I feel that Alinea \u00a0fails to meet the standards of a Three Star Michelin restaurant. \u00a0I got the lower cost wine pairing with my meal and some dishes were completely distasteful without drinking the \"paired\" drink. \u00a0My second dish that I received was so bitter that I had to drown out that taste with a very sweet wine that was paired with it. \u00a0Now, I might have a strange school of thought, but when I think of a pairing, it's a complement to a dish to make it better, not a subtitute for a poorly tasting dish. \u00a0This happened throughout the meal where the dish was completely off and I had to drown out the taste with the paired drink.Final thoughts:Having experienced several great Michelin restaurants around the world, I was very disappointed with my experience with Alinea. \u00a0They were creative in their approach to form an experience, but they failed to capture my praise. \u00a0I would recommend people not waste their money at this establishment as your culinary adventure will leave you disappointed and still hungry at the end. \u00a0For the cost, they deserve a one star review for not \u00a0making their food taste delicious regardless of ambiance.This experience has left me surprised that the standards to receiving a Michelin Star, and even more so for three stars in the United States is low.My past favorite restaurants if people can travel: I would recommend Ciel Bleu in Amsterdamn, UltraViolet in Shanghai, Thoumieux in Paris.edit*: Also, I was confused why I didn't get my menu in the beginning of my meal and I was very disappointed that it wasn't signed by the chef. \u00a0It would take him 5 minutes to do as his patrons are all paying for tickets in advance", "Date": "2013-11-22", "Author_Location": "Glenview, IL"}, {"Author": "SHIRLE Y L.", "ReviewID": "bANicdQr8q0z8ajuta8oMw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went in Oct 2011their price is reasonable and it's world rank #6 in 2011!!!The way the present the food is very delicate and creativeMy friends and I would like to go back", "Date": "2014-03-10", "Author_Location": "Hacienda Heights, CA"}, {"Author": "Ryan L.", "ReviewID": "BcUuOumRZPS3HkkVeWb-Fw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think everything that needs to be said has been said about this place.

I've been dreaming of visiting you ever since I've acquired an unhealthy obsession with food. Sometimes on cold Chicago nights, I would curl up on my couch with my phone and ogle delicious food photos on Yelp (pathetic I know). Now, being a poor college student, spending hundreds of dollars on a meal made me a bit woozy. So visiting Alinea was a dream, and only that (decided I would one day visit when I'm a rich 80 year old prune)But then, my boyfriend decided to surprise me with a visit Alinea for my 21 birthday. And oh lordy the food was SO good. We were presented with a 13 course meal, and each dish was a surprise. The front of the restaurant is very unassuming - I'm sure there've been people who've walked right by the building and not known the wonders that take place inside. When you walk in, you go through a meandering maze and at the end encounter automatic sliding metal doors. You are then immediately greeted by hostesses and taken to your table. The food was all amazing. The presentation was mind-blowing. Dishes were fun, quirky, unique, and fun to eat. Waiters were attentive, really take care of you, and explain every dish. A few dishes that really stood out to me:-Hot chocolate: you are given a little bowl of hot chocolate before you are taken to your table... it was infused with abinao (what is this exactly..?), smoke, and spruce. The hot chocolate had so much depth to it... really new flavors. -Scallop: it was marinated in mirin and sesame, and you were presented with a burning hot rock on which you cooked your scallop however long you desired. The scallop itself was SO tender and the flavors were absolutely amazing. -Shrimp head: Now, I'm an avid seafood/sushi lover, and have been presented with shrimp heads multiple times, but have always avoided eating them (I mean... it just looks... weird). However, I took a bite of the shrimp head, which came with aioli, and it was amazing. Bursting with flavor and delightfully crunchy. -Maitake: O.M.G. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, but this was SO good. The dish itself had pumpernickel and black garlic, and the servers poured broth (which had been heated up on your table on a little flame) over the plate. This is arguably my favorite dish of the night. -Duck: five presentations of duck - duck breast, foie gras, and who knows what else (doesn't matter, it was all amazing). You were also giving 50+ different spices/toppings/amazing-ness on a platter (presentation was absolutely beautiful) to eat with the duck. The servers said there was no pressure to eat all of them, but I pretty much cleaned the platter. The duck was AMAZING. Rich, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. -Black Truffle explosion: Another favorite of the night... the dumpling literally burst in your mouth and you were literally overwhelmed with intense truffle goodness. Orgasm in the mouth.-Balloon: this one was really fun - a taffy ballon (literally looks like a balloon) made with apple taffy and inflated with helium. I managed to inhale all my helium and sounded like a chipmunk - got a good laugh out of that.-the final dessert presentation: really quirky and fun. To be honest, I was so full by this point that I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have, but it was delicious and probably one of the funnest dishes of the night.There were more dishes, but these were the ones that really stood out to me. Just a tip: DO NOT take photos with flash - photos are more than welcome (I definitely took like 50 photos), but take a picture with flash and the servers will ask you to turn it off. I wish they told us that at the beginning, especially since I'm sure 99% of the people who visit take pictures, and it'll save everyone the awkwardness of being confronted.

Is this the best restaurant I have had in a while? Yes. Is this the most expensive meal I have EVER had? Yes. Do I consider value when I rate a restaurant? Yes. Is this a five-star? No.Alinea has the most creative presentation of any restaurant I had ever been to. I saw other reviewers analogize their food to art and in some ways, I have to agree - but not necessarily in the flavors as much as in the presentation. For example, the helium apple taffy balloon was quite gimmicky but oh so fun. My dessert (chocolate pinata et al.) was presented on the table itself -- allowing me to finger paint with the dessert sauces drizzled directly onto the silicone table cloth. That was fun. Several courses were integrated into the table decor -- and the diner helps prepare the food. It almost felt like a partnership with the chef (if I dare to say so). The presentation of food was 10-stars.Thinking back, I feel like all the flavors are familiar. It's like having a meal of all your favorite flavors from every restaurant compressed into a single experience. Is any of the flavors truly unique? Not really. (I felt that a lot of their courses have Asian influences in the spices they used.) Are the flavors done well? Absolutely. Alinea does a very good re-introduction of everything I had already met. But I didn't meet anything new.My favorite courses are the 60 condiments and the duck foie gras (that was served as part of 4 duck tastings). The 60 condiments were fun and unique. The duck foie gras, they just nailed it in a way I haven't experienced in a while. Same with the snapper tartar served in a floating lily bowl-- again, not new in terms of flavor but they just did it so well and the presentation was wonderful. \u00a0I also loved the black truffle explosion -- but I wonder, how much of it is the chef vs. the pure amazingness that is truffles? It took me over 5 hours to finish the meal because my stomach just couldn't handle all the food at the expected 3 hour pace.

Sure, the attention whore in me really wants to be a drop in the bucket of 900 some-odd reviews. But I also want to express and document a surprisingly moving experience. Cue the tissues...I've lived in Lincoln Park for nearly 6 years without knowing that the minimalist grey building on Halsted housed Alinea. But then the cab dropped me off outside its doors, and I thought, \"Duh, this is totes Alinea.\" The doorman directed me down a narrow passageway lined with little pine trees. Was there mood lighting, too? There was certainly mood lighting in my head. It was a wintry kind of pretty, and it was strange. Pretty soon, I stood at a pair of stainless steel elevator doors.Just kidding, it's not an elevator. It was just made to look like one. The doors automatically opened up and I was greeted by a hostess on the other side. I said I was meeting a couple of other people that were already there and she motioned me toward my friends standing by the kitchen entrance. By the way, their faces looked like this: :D :D. We were so giddy. Someone promptly took my coat and handed me a cup of frothy hot chocolate. Still waiting on our other friends, the hostess led us upstairs and to our table. The decor is nice, but objectively quite plain. It's like the dining room of your very rich, but very stuffy friend. The word \"slate\" comes to mind. Our round table seated six, and was set with simple napkins and huge, cylindrical vases filled with purple flowers and ice water. It was extremely pretty, but every detail of Alinea has a purpose and we would come to use the vase later on in the meal.After the rest of our party had arrived and water specifications ordered (oh, don't think you'll be getting ordinary slices of lemon with your water-- instead, expect a tiny pitcher of potent lemon reduction), a waiter gave us a general rundown of how to approach the meal. \"We will tell you the best way,\" and \"some things are time sensitive,\" were emphasized. My table also ordered the traditional wine pairing for $150 per person. Highlight courses:SCALLOP: \u00a0I do not usually like scallops but this was just... succulent. Marinated in tangy Asian flavors and then grilled yourself on a super-hot rock. I could eat this everyday. SHRIMP HEAD: Don't look at the eyes. Don't look at the eyes. Don't look at the eyes. Oh my God, that is so delicious. The aioli was so creamy and flavorful, dripping down the edge of the glass. One of the ongoing thoughts in my head was that nothing at Alinea tastes like you expect it to, and this dish showed that.ONAGA: Many of my dining companions said this was their favorite course of the night. It floated in a small glass bowl atop of the aforementioned ice water vase. The fish was finely diced and oh-so-smooth. Fatty in the best sense of the word. HALIBUT: Uh oh, is that mole? I don't like mole. That's what I was thinking when this dish was being explained to me. Then I took a bite, and all of my negative notions of mole went out the window. Deep, even sensual flavors, but far less bold than the moles I am used to. The fish was so tender and that tiny blob of avocado puree is absolutely worth mentioning. I think it was just avocado and salt, but it was evidence of how every single component of Alinea displays the ultimate in execution. Nothing is arbitrary. DUCK....?????....!!!!!!: Sixty mystery flavors to mix with five preparations of duck. A shining example of how Alinea is unparalleled in using presentation to enhance taste. \"Mainstay\" courses like the truffle and hot potato were super delicious, but I didn't include them in my highlights because I felt that the flavors were safe. And now I'll say the only critical thing I have to say of Alinea: they played it relatively safe. Yes, with their chocolate explosions and crunchy shrimp heads, I still wanted more. Tasting new flavor combinations is a considerable component of my food enjoyment, particularly if I know I'm hitting up a foodie spot. Push my limits. Make me think, \"I'm not sure if I like this.\" With that being said, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and appreciation for all of the passion and labor that goes into Alinea.

Alinea is sleek and chic without making you feel out of your element or uncomfortable with the modern class of the restaurant. From start to finish, the service and food astonished me. Every course was an exploration for my tastebuds of new combinations and interesting twists on food I had never experienced before. As a broke foodie, this was the best example of food as art I've ever seen.

Standouts to me in presentation were the Lamb, Blueberry dessert, Green Apple Balloon and the White Chocolate finale.Best part of my night: Meeting Grant Archatz. Oh Em Gee I almost died when I saw him coming out to tables for the dessert course. Art at the table executed by the artist himself in person. The best chef in the country, in my humble opinion, pure culinary genius. I whispered to him...\"We're really big fans\"...and I'm sure totally creeped him out...but it had to be said!Alinea was the most amazing culinary experience I've ever had.

Alinea lives up to the hype in my opinion and is something not to be missed if you can swing it. For me It was a once in a lifetime experience and I will always remember it. Stand outs for me were: black truffle explosion, hot potato/cold potato, smoked morels (morels that were planted and harvested after a burn giving these fungi a nice smokey flavor. seriously!), assorted seafood (crab, lobster, razor clam, oyster leaf) which were served on this cool vessel made of seaweed, the taffy balloon and the white chocolate bomb desserts. I also enjoyed the lamb dish served with 86 different components for you to experiment with. The presentation is spectacular. So inventive, each course is a work of art.

YES2) Was it a extraordinary experience? YES3) Do the wine pairing? NO4) Would I go again? NO unless I became a millionaire in the near future.To further elaborate for those that need more explanation... ALINEA was an awesome experience. I've been wanting to check this place out for the longest time and I thought it was a perfect opportunity when I had a chance to visit my friend in Chicago this past weekend. I will not go into the details of the dishes since there are plenty of other reviews that do and it will ruin a few surprises of the whole dining experience. For me it was about the whole dining experience that made it worthwhile. If I had to simply describe Alinea, I would say Alinea = Art. I will admit the food was ok. I mean some of the dishes were divine. Others were mediocre. If you're planning on coming here just for the food maybe you should reconsider. But if you want an overall enjoyable, surprise filled dining experience most definitely come here! I read multiple reviews and had a fairly good idea what to expect and I still loved my experience at Alinea! As far as the wine pairing... After much deliberation I decided just to go with the standard wine pairing ($150 for 9 pours which equals about 3 glasses of wine... But I think it was more than 3 glasses). The pairing itself was quite good. The wine really did go well with the dishes. But towards the end it just became too much wine. I ended up probably not drinking about half of the amount of wine they give you. And believe me I am a drinker! Although I did enjoy the wine pairing, I would have been perfectly happy with just a glass or two of wine. And the sommelier will most definitely be willing to help you out in your wine selection. So for me I didn't quite think the wine pairing was necessary. Now would I go back? No... Just because it's a lot of money and with that money I would want to try other expensive restaurants.

It was by far the most creative, well served and beautiful dinner my wife and I had ever had. Alinea burst the bubble(literally and figuratively) on my molecular gastronomy naivet\u00e9. It was also the most expensive so you get what you pay for.I feel like I could write about book about our dining experience at Alinea but given the lopsided profit/effort ratio I'll stick to the highlights.Upon walking in we were transported into a snowy, windy pine forest with blue lights and warmth despite the appearance was cold. Pretty cool.We arrived early and were offered hot chocolate. Not the usual fare of course but chocolate with salt mixed in with a pine foam on top. I never knew this before but I LOVE PINE FOAM. As weird as that sounds.Hot Potato Cold Potato. Like the LOTR MEME I once thought all you could do with Po-ta-toes is \"Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew\". Well, that and make French fries but Grant Aschatz has openend my eyes to much, much more. Drinking down this truffly mix was a joy.Balloons. I doubt many people considering going here have seen the rocky horror picture show but if you've heard of it you know that at the end they bring out red balloons to de-verginize you for seeing it the first time. I thought that's kind of what was going on here, thankfully not, would have been really weird. This fun snack was comprised of apple fruit leather and helium. You would bite your balloon at the top suck in the air, laugh with a really high pitched sound and enjoy the apple flavor. It's definitely the lightest desert I've ever eaten!Spolier Alert! Don't read if you plan on going! Explosion. WTF is this guy doing I thought to myself as a Chef walked up to my waterproofed table. Magic I decided as I saw him starting to artistically add lines and dabs of sweet tasting sauces all over the table. It was a great work of art, reminded me of the tricks they have at Hibachi restaurants minus any heat. Biggest surprise came right at the end when what I thought had been a clay jar exploded on our table to reveal chocolate shards, cotton sugar, dry ice and other sweet flavors.Interesting Fact: Did you know Alinea has their dishware made custom for them no other place has it? Yes, that's how they have those dishes with needles sticking out of them, i.e. ginger or Hot/Cold potato.The last dish had a sour note. I went to my car directly in front of Alinea and found a parking ticket.

The first course was cider immediately inside the door you are to enjoy the 10 steps it takes to give them your coat. No clue until I saw it on the menu that was part of the meal. Best bite on the menu: Truffle explosion. Though this too was touted as a shooter and must be taken in one bite quickly as it explodes. Delicious - just wish the best part of the meal could be savored.Service: Pretentious as a 20% tip is required and pre-paid. That's right. Tip is pre-paid. I always tip above and beyond for service but pre-paying makes it a salary not to insure proper service.Dessert: Final course is served off a sheet of rubber. That they reuse. Rubber is typically porous. Could it be properly sanitized for the next guest? The chef creates the dessert presentation himself which is cool - except he is so inside his own head he doesn't smile, say thank you, or do anything at all besides announce the components. Way to bring the whole experience down. The guy that filled my water was friendlier. \u00a0(PS - no tap water only bottled)Dress code: Variable. Reviews say no jeans but two men were wearing jeans.

To set expectations, the meal, including wine pairing, totaled $564 per person in our party of 6.Now, I'm no stranger to spending a lot on fine dining- The French Laundry, Benu, Daniel, Cyrus, and the Bazaar were all extravagant and decadent dining experiences I've been fortunate to enough to try.

Were the dishes innovative and unique? Yes. Was presentation whimsical, playful, and imaginative? Yes. Was service attentive and informed? Yes. However, was the experience as a whole better than others in this class? No. Was it worth it? NO.Maybe this comes down to personal preference. I'm more a fan of precise, classic plating techniques over the Jackson Pollock style presentation I found on most of the dishes here. Dessert was *SPOILER ALERT* served by Grant Achatz himself LITERALLY shattering a filled white chocolate egg all over our (nicely prepared) table. We were then given spoons.I also had issue with the distinct lack of traditional luxury ingredients. I understand the idea behind creative and non-traditional use of ingredients. But for my money, I'd rather have a nice scoop of caviar rather than a crazy, what-am-I-eating composition of discarded corn products (corn silk, corn smut [huitlacoche], and corn husk). Indeed, the waiter rather cheerfuly informed us that yes, in fact, we were eating trash!The myriad rules and regulations were also off-putting. Buy your ticket online. Wear a jacket.

I made my reservation at Alinea for the same evening that I was flying into Chicago. Unluckily for me, my flight was late. I called them as I was en route in a cab and they were super understanding about my predicament, tucking my suitcase away nicely upon my arrival. I was dining solo for the night and was impressed with how well timed the courses were. A course would get cleared away and I wouldn't get more than about 2-3 pages into my magazine before the next course arrived! At the end, they give you a copy of the tasting menu. I asked if Chef would sign it, which they readily agreed to. Since he wasn't at Alinea that day, they took down my home address and a perfect, beautiful signed copy of the menu arrived in the mail less than a week later!Would happily dine here again.

This place is booked for at least two months out.- Mental prep - don't over-hype this place before your first visit. Like most other fine dining restaurants, this place is very, very good. However, if you keep thinking this is supposed to be the #1 rated restaurant in the U.S., you're likely to leave disappointed (like my wife and I).- Dinner for the 6 of us took over 6 hours to complete. Make sure you go with fun, good company. Even for couples...it's hard to have a 3-hour dinner together...we saw many bored couples that didn't talk.- Dress nice. Real nice. 'nuff said.- Don't go cheap here. If you are already spending this much on dinner, might as well get the wine pairing (if you like to drink different kinds of wine). Or, if you're like us and don't drink that much, just get a bottle. Expect to spend about $800 - $1,000 for two people. - The food profiles are innovative and presentation was visually stunning. It takes a true genise to come up with each course. However, my wife and I were only \"knock our socks off wowed\" by just a few courses. We particularly liked the razor clams, crab, and mushrooms served on heated stones.- Service - it's nice, but less formal / attentive than what I would expect at a place like this. Not that we enjoy a place that is super formal and stuffy, but it felt a bit too casual for us. - We also would have appreciated a bit more explanation of what we are eating before each course. Our waiter just didn't know or wanted to spend the time to explain. In fact, it was a bit annoying that he wants us to guess what we were eating. Really annoying, now that I think about it again. We paid good money to eat there, show an effort to explain things.- Just to be clear, none of the courses tasted bad. We were just looking to be wowed by each course...and it didn't happen.- Dessert - while seeing them prepare it in front of us was cool, it really wasn't that complex and the taste was a bit disappointing. - Valet - it's only $11, do it.

I think my jaw hit the floor. Then, he said that he was going to create my last dessert course himself on my table.

I heard recently it was rated 3 Michelin Stars, good for you I supposed.At the sake of what my friend hates people doing on Yelp, I seriously, desperately, crazily wanted to like this place. From Chuckeats to my foodie-tastic Yelp friends from home, everyone had been raving about this place and somehow I lucked out on scoring the last reservation on Independence day at 6 pm. Awesome!But that's pretty much where the good experience ended. I specifically spoke to the reservationist on the phone about bringing a fine bottle of $200 wine that I had been saving for this occasion. She neither mentioned their alcohol policy nor told me anything about my wine. Chicago is a BYOB centric town, so this was my expectation.When we first arrived, I brought out the bottle and one of the waiters stared at me and said \"We don't do that here.\" It wasn't rude, it wasn't friendly, it wasn't polite but in the end he just looked at me like I was some dumb foreigner. I tried to explain that I had told the reservationist on the phone and no one told me it was a non-BYOB place. He got into an ARGUMENT with me over this, and in the end I had to say, you know, I will put it away. He basically captured the attention of the whole dining room area, so everyone was entertained I suppose. Classy.My goodness, if I were a restaurant that perhaps did not mention to the guest that they were not BYOB in a BYOB town, I would at least be nicer about it.Then, the food. We opted for wine because I wanted some but their choice was mediocre and the bottle was $100+ for .. mediocre. The food came, and it was a confusing string of random servers, not our server, and then our waiter changed, and then it was a waitress, and then I ended up having to ask for water 6 times. I expect this at Chili's, I don't expect to pay $600+ for a meal and have to ask them to refill my water when it's empty, not once, but 6 times.I expect consistency, the servers, the waiters, the people putting food in front of you. I expect them to know what they're talking about and if asked what the gelatin is made out of, I expect them to know. If they don't know, then they should ask and get back to me, not run away and not murmur a word. Who does that?Every dish was subpar because although it was elegantly presented, the flavors clashed, the play on traditional cooking did not work out and half of the time the waiters didn't bother to even tell us how to eat it. If you make it complicated with no instructions, perhaps we're not enjoying it correctly?In the end, even the main dish, the steak, I had high expectations, but mine was cold and the bf's was warm, hence ours were differently cooked thus did not taste the same even though we both opted for medium rare. When I got the bill, I just felt unsatisfied. I've been to restaurants fancier and pricier, I've been to other 3 Michelin stars and some 2 Michelin stars that deserve one more, but the food here did not do it for me, especially with all the confusion. The service was terrible, who argues with a guest and makes a scene in front of other guests? And the whole evening was stiffly subpar and awkward after the experience. Ugh. Will not be back.

truly a one-of-a-kind experience; while I enjoyed the food, Alinea works better as an \"experience\" rather than a \"meal,\" which makes it (for me at least) one to go to once but maybe not one that I must seek out again***Alinea is considered one of the best restaurants in the country. \u00a0Alinea specializes in progressive cuisine (molecular gastronomy), but it one-ups similar places (like The Bazaar and Baume) by not only playing around with how the food is cooked (but also how the diner experiences it).Alinea has a set tasting menu with many courses and chef Grant Achatz shows incredible range by highlighting how he can put out fresh and vibrant Californian-like flavors (steelhead roe with watermelon, kaffir lime, cucumber blossom), classical flavor combinations with strong cooking technique (morels and hon shimeji mushrooms with cream and a red wine reduction), and creative interpretations on traditional dishes (like the peach, basil, burrata, balsamic, and almond plate, which combines the elements of a great salad, cheese plate and dessert all into one).There were other great things as well. \u00a0There was dehydrated yuba (tofu skin) that was wrapped with shrimp, miso and sesame seeds. \u00a0The crispy texture and flavor were both pleasing. \u00a0Another great dish was their farm salad, which was also a clever presentation. \u00a0There was a base of tomatoes (very fresh) and gazpacho (very tangy) that also came with goat cheese, carrot and red onion. \u00a0The table's centerpiece (a herb and greens garden) was used for the salad as you snip desired herbs/greens and then mix into the salad.I wished though that they didn't alter the goat cheese. \u00a0They must have freezed it or something to give it a different texture. \u00a0Unfortunately, it wasn't really a texture improvement. \u00a0It came across like cold goat cheese that had been in the cold part of the refrigerator too long and thus not in harmony with the other ingredients.Similar to the farm salad, the short rib pasta combined both a playful presentation as well as an interactive approach. \u00a0You dress the pasta sheet yourself with the many ingredients provided (olives, garlic, blackberry, smoked salt). \u00a0The flavors were strong and the beef was tender, juicy and savory.The meal could have used more meat though. \u00a0They did this one dish called (agneau), which was very dainty portions of meat (lamb I think) that came with crispy potatoes and a rich sauce. \u00a0The combination of ingredients produced a satisfying flavor, but the meat was dry (in addition to being very small). \u00a0Unfortunately, it was the only other meat dish and it did not have the impact of other meat dishes I've had at similar restaurants.They did a lot of seafood dishes though and they were good. \u00a0There was a nice scallop in a light broth as well as razor clams in XO sauce (a spicy-sweet-salty Asian sauce). \u00a0There was some moist mackerel that was made very fragrant with the addition of juniper as well as a fritter of hamachi (made fragrant with a vanilla bean).A lot of the other items were small bites and all of them were at the very least good (with some of them standing out more than others). \u00a0The black truffle explosion ravioli was good and flavorful (even if the pasta was a little too thick). \u00a0I also liked their lemongrass shooter with gelee, dragronfruit, Thai basil, and lime.Pricing was high, but Alinea is a one-of-a-kind experience. \u00a0Still, despite the many-many courses, I left a little bit hungry. \u00a0The experience was very satisfying, but when just considering this as a meal, I did not leave Alinea as content as I did after my visits to Ria or Avenues.Service was incredibly professional and polite (as well as unbelievably meticulous with immediate recognition of diner needs), but it was a little too formal for my taste. \u00a0The formal service here seemed consistent with other Chicago fine dining spots so it might just be a difference between West Coast dining and Chicago dining.The service also seemed a little too rehearsed for me. \u00a0It probably guarantees a consistently excellent service experience, but I prefer waiters/waitresses/servers who can identify customer preferences and thus customize the experience for each diner (Baume, The Restaurant at Meadowood, and The Village Pub are great at accomplishing this).In the end, the service though is very strong and the food has a big wow factor. \u00a0Alinea provided an experience unlike any I've ever had at a restaurant (or expect to have in the future). \u00a0And this makes Alinea a must visit if you love food (and even worth a special trip to Chicago). \u00a0But you should consider extending your trip because there is no shortage of very good restaurants in Chicago.Valet parking is available. \u00a0Street parking also seems to be available.", "Date": "2011-08-12", "Author_Location": "Playa del Rey, CA"}, {"Author":

In total contrast to what was going on downstairs in the kitchen, I was seated in a silent dining room upstairs. I had the pleasure of eating with a top chef from Holland who had just finished externing in Mr. Achatz's kitchen for the last two weeks. So aside from being in the number-one restaurant in the nation, it also didn't hurt that I was across from the best dining companion in the world. Service began with with a waiter (you will have about 10 throughout the night, which is why I say \"a\" waiter as opposed to \"our\" waiter) asking if we had any food allergies. Then, he proceeded to discuss the wine options: a tasting to go alongside the 22-course menu, or we could peruse their robust wine list. I had no doubt their collection of wines would be stellar, but we intrinsically opted for the pairings, so as not to skimp on this experience one bit. And so it began with a champagne cocktail sent up from Grant. Cheers to that. Throughout the service, the wait staff was like an acting troupe in the way that they dramatically and believably presented each course and wine pairing. From the way they pulled out the table for me to use the restroom, or the way they switched my water glass when my lip prints started to pile up, or how they unfolded my napkin on my lap...it was all done in such a theatrical way. I felt like a queen. As the courses arrived, each one was more unexpected than the last. It was so hard for me to focus on what I was eating at the moment, because I was still in awe about the last thing I put into my mouth, yet was anxious for the next dish to be dropped. Sounds like a personal problem, I know :-) There were so many other elements besides consumption going on during this perfectly paced, 3.5 hour meal. The chef truly piques your curiosity and plays with all your senses. You can tell he has a sense of humor as well, as there are times you are challenged to \"play\" with your food. You'll notice that some of the hardware used to serve the dishes are designed exclusively for Alinea, for your meal. What an incredible thought. At one point, the silverware and china gets replaced with something that looks like what French royalty in the 1500's ate off of. I felt like I was in different places and times throughout the night, all from the corner table in an unmarked Lincoln Park restaurant. I truly don't want to go into detail about the dishes, as everyone deserves to be surprised when going to this place. I will say that you won't be disappointed by anything, at all. And even after 22 courses, you won't be \"full\" - you'll be completely and utterly satisfied on every level, however. The absolute highlight of the night was dessert for me. Sure it was delicious, but the real bonus was in Grant coming to the table to prepare it in front of us himself. I will never, EVER forget that moment. It was like watching Da Vinci paint the Mona Lisa. Needless to say, Alinea is not a restaurant. It was a museum. I didn't arrive hungry to scarf down food. I came to pay admission and wander through each exhibit and learn something, experience something. I would highly recommend this experience at Alinea to everyone who can appreciate the art behind food and exceptional food service. There is an energy within this institution that is literally life-changing. I left exhausted, like my mind had been blown for 3.5 hours straight. It was a feeling I've never known before. This experience comes with a price tag. If you can afford it, do it. If you're a foodie who can't readily drop this much on a bill, understandable. But save up for it and treat yourself fully. Trust me, your brain will not have space to worry about money when you are going through 22 plates of utter perfection.

My boyfriend randomly took me here for a late-night dinner the night before I left for a weekend trip without him. I knew all about Alinea. I knew I was tired after a long day. I knew it was a terribly rainy night and I looked horrible. I also knew how much of his paycheck would go into the meal. Needless to say, I was pretty angry at his extravagance (though I knew he did it all in love), and I was not at all in the mood for a fancy shmancy dinner like this.So dinner definitely started off on the wrong foot. Luckily, by the time course 6 came around, I had gotten over myself and I started to feel like a kid in toy heaven. Actually, I felt like a judge on Food Network's Iron Chef and I was LOVING it. The bf, though, was scarfing every morsel down as if his life depended on it. That kind of made me sad, but I didn't let it get to me too much and I proceeded to smell, observe, and savor every course with absolute delight. And some of those courses were seriously unique and amazing. Like super wow. And our servers were sooo kind, so professional, and so hospitable.After 4 hours (a little past 1 a.m.) and 22 courses later, I was completely full and content and ready for our final dessert course of the evening. Let's just say that this dessert course was extra special. Because it came with an engagement ring. Haha. Who woulda thunk it?

Everything started out great and ended quite badly for me. So my birthday was kind of ruined. Want to know why? Please read on....I am giving Alinea five stars because this was a dining experience like none other delivered by a staff that if they put their mind to it could save the world from every single challenge this globe is facing.The restaurant is impossible to find from the outside as its entrance is intentionally hidden at the end of a rabbit hole like cave in a typical building like every other on the street.Be on time, this is like showing up to a theater, you have to be at your table at the time of the reservation.Dress appropriately: Men should wear a shirt and a jacket, women should dress up like they're going out. Jeans are probably not a good idea. This is a formal affair, dress like a formal affair. On the other hand, as a proponent of casual clothes and being comfortable while you eat, I would like to recommend that you not overdo it with ties and uncomfortable getups. Be comfortable but sharp looking and you will do fine.Once inside, you're seated at your own table, briefed about the meal ahead, asked about your preferences in terms of refreshments, offered the wine matching option.The restaurant is softly lit, and relatively quiet. Watch out if you have a big voice like I do -- you will have to remind yourself to talk softly.Before making a reservation at this restaurant, please check their website first to see if the ingredients in the individual courses agree with your dietary restrictions. I have seafood allergies, specifically shellfish. If you inform Alinea ahead of time they will make accommodations for you in the course line up.There are two options 12 course meal and 24 course meal. We made the mistake of being over-enthusiastic and picking the 24 course meal with wine pairings.Every piece that was presented to us was unique, delicious, and a work of art in itself. I am sure every other reviewer has attempted to describe the line up and such. I won't go into all that detail here.I HIGHLY recommend first timers to get the 12 course meal. You think you can do the 24 but you're wrong and you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. It's not the quantity of the food that's the problem, it's the number of ingredients.By the time we hit #18, neither my mother nor I wanted to see food ever again for the rest of our lives because the number of ingredients in our tummies was probably about in the hundreds. Take that and mix it with the 12 wines we had tasted by that point and you have yourself one hell of an upset tummy.I literally turned green after #16 which I think was the lobster -- which I have not reacted to before although it is shellfish. So I had a small tiny piece of it. I got very ill in a very short period of time but I assumed it was a temporary thing and that it would pass. I was not about to lose my dinner or anything.But the feeling of something horrible is about to happen never passed. When we hit course #18, I called the wait staff and told them to stop bringing us more food and bring us the bill. They were super nice and courteous about our early departure by the way which made me feel even worse than I was feeling for leaving.We got the check; Alinea was super nice to us with the check, they discounted the courses we did not have, and the wine we did not drink. This was a class act. I was ready to pay the full amount and leave as soon as possible.Needless to say I barely made it to my room at our hotel to find my insides boiling up and refusing to stay in me. I hate to say it but I lost all 300 dollars worth of exotic spices, meats, foliage, vegetables, and beautiful design down the toilet in less than 15 minutes.I was sick for the rest of the night and it kind of ruined my birthday. After this incident things did not taste right for two weeks. Everything tasted salty to me.To this day the smell of peanut paste ( a flavoring that was omni present in almost every we ate at Alinea) makes me throw up a little in my mouth. Ok I kid about that part. :-)Am I complaining about Alinea? No, not one bit. These were a bunch of beautiful, talented, hard working individuals that put on a feast and show for all senses.I think this restaurant helped me realize my dislike for multi course meals and fusion cuisine. So the problem is with me, not with Alinea.Let my story be a cautionary tale. If you have not done this before, proceed with caution, get the tasting menu -- 12 courses and not the grand tour -- 24 courses.Do not get the wine pairings unless you're an experienced wine connoisseur -- as it adds up in terms of volume fast and you end up mixing champagne, white wine and several red wines -- a recipe for disaster for someone like me -- a light light drinker.", "Date": "2009-04-16", "Author_Location": "Austin, TX"}, {"Author": "Mimi L.", "ReviewID": "8cjjcyiOpdAJdUANN90cvw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I traveled to Chicago in December, in the winter, in the cold, and with wind.

We walked in only seeing walls and no door. So what did we do? We continued walking and prayed for a door to appear. \u00a0All of a sudden *poof* a secret door slid open on the left and we walked through and was greeted by a hostess. We waited a few minutes while our table was being set up and took a glimpse of the kitchen. The kitchen was immaculate and things were moving like clock work. While walking upstairs to our table I saw that the room was very modern and minimal with a touch of techno . I don't know. It's hard to explain. We were seated, greeted, and given a snippet of what was to come. The menu was not given to us because they wanted it to be more of a surprise. \u00a0Once situated, the meal began and we were served 22 courses of gastronomically incredible dishes.

Okay, so tickets were booked for Chicago and I called one month in advance to make reservations at Alinea. I got a busy signal for 2 hours straight, but I finally got through and reservations were made. Success!Okay, my party and I got here and nearly missed this place. The outside looked like some type of garage until we saw a small folding sign on the ground that says \"Alinea.\" Bingo! We were taken to our seats. We were the first ones to arrive and it felt really awkward at first because there were so many servers around and they were looking at us. My party didn't really talk much because it would echo off the walls since it was that quiet. After 10-15 minutes more diners showed up...*phew the awkwardness was gone.So here is the dinner in a brief summary:-Very interesting, nothing I have experienced before-Assembling was needed in some dishes-Everything was delicious-Loved the concept-Nifty plating techniques-Delicious foam...yes foam with taste!-Took a shot of the \"aquarium\" and had a leaf stuck in my windpipe...haha that wasn't fun-The glasses were never half full-Explosion...wow that was something, wished there were more of those-The waitstaff warned us on some foods not to eat with mouth open or it would end up on ourselves or the person across from us (I wonder if anyone really got food on others)-We were also warned not to lick this ice cold lid-thing because apparently someone in the past done it and their tongue got stuck - at least his tongue was stuck to something yummy-The dessert was AMAZING, it was beautifully put together by Chef Grant Achatz himselfSo how was the experience? Definitely worth hopping on a plane for and planning everything around this 4.5 hour dinner for. Every dish was like Christmas because you don't know what is going to come out next. And as for me I was like a kid, who couldn't wait until Christmas to open my presents - that I broke the rules and opened lids and such when they told me not to. I still remember one of the waitstaff said to me, \"You just couldn't have waited 20 seconds huh?\" Haha. The whole experience was very interesting and fun. The servers were really friendly and funny, which I thought they would've been more uptight because of how fancy this place was. My party and I had a great time here!

In the 2011 edition Alinea came in at number one in North America and number six in the world (the top five venues are all in Europe with the number one ranking awarded to Denmark's Noma). I have yet to dine in any of the top five restaurants, but am having a very hard time envisioning a meal better than the wonderfully creative, phenomenal meal I just enjoyed at Alinea. Imagining food more exquisite is like trying to visualize a color that does not exist.After months of anticipation tonight was my birthday dinner at Alinea. The entrance to Alinea is nondescript and easy to miss. Once you open the unmarked door you stroll down a long modern hallway and eventually are greeted by a host; you are then ushered inside for the start of a magical culinary journey that is far more than just a great meal. Alinea does not just have the best food in the U.S., but likely has the best staff as well. For our four hour long, twenty course meal we were completely pampered by our team of servers. Despite being such a high end venue, there is a fun vibe; the servers (despite being impeccably polished) are laid back, interact with you quite a bit and exhibit wonderful senses of humor; the experience is not at all pretentious as one may imagine. All the staff were great but Johnny in particular stood out as probably the best server we have ever had. Jason deserves kudos as well. My wife does not have the most adventurous palate, but the staff was very flexible with making substitutions. Out of the twenty courses there was not a single dud. About a half dozen of them were so awesome they were mind blowing. Each course has such a unique presentation; the food looks like modern art, \u00a0but tastes better than any more traditional fare I have consumed. It is hard to do the food justice in a review as the experience of dining at Alinea really exercises all the senses and is a transcending experience; several of the courses even utilize non edible scents to interact with the taste of the cuisine (as well as to evoke memories) such as maple leaves that are scorched, creating the effluvium of burning leaves wafting throughout the dining room.I do not want to describe the courses in detail as being surprised magnifies the experience, but will touch upon a couple of highlights. The first few courses are seafood and the most beautiful was presented on piece of petrified driftwood draped with seaweed and topped with four delicious shellfish dishes artistically doctored up with different flavor components, still sitting inside their shell. The mushroom dish and the venison were my other favorite savories and all the dessert courses were amazing, but the final course - a sort of chocolate pinata broken open at your artistically decorated table (with an assortment of sauces) was out of this world. Alinea does not have a full bar as Chef Achatz believes that hard alcohol would dull one's taste buds to the delicate flavor combinations of the food. There is a fairly large wine list and they offer a standard pairing ($160) or a reserve pairing (about $250) or wines by the glass, bottle and half bottle. While the food is expensive ($210 per/person), there are some reasonably priced wines (bottles start at about $55). My appreciation of fine food far exceeds my appreciation of fine wine and I was not made to feel at all bad for ordering one of the more inexpensive bottles of wine. There are also all sorts of different waters to choose from (including three different sparkling) and at the end of the meal coffee is served in a French press.To cap off our meal we were presented with a copy of the menu and a folder to safely tuck it inside. My wife had made Alinea aware it was my birthday and in addition to serving me an extra dessert course they even had a happy birthday message printed on my copy of the menu. We also were invited for a kitchen tour at the end of the meal and then were escorted outside by a staff member to a waiting taxi. Despite the experience lasting just over four hours it was one I did not want to end, but will take with me many happy memories (and a very full belly). This was truly a meal fit for a king; the most beautiful food I have ever seen, some of the best food I have ever tasted and the best service I have received. I have now had the privilege of enjoying Grant Achatz' three main venues (Alinea, Next and The Aviary); Achatz is an absolute genius and is truly the master of modern cuisine. Someday I would like to try one of the restaurants in Europe that Restaurant Magazine has ranked as superior to Alinea but I am fairly confident that Alinea will remain number one in my book. I would not be surprised if Alinea ascends higher in the rankings before I make it to one of the other venues as I have the feeling that as good as Achatz is now, he is yet to reach his prime and somehow will continue to improve and set new trends.", "Date": "2011-12-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Valerie J.", "ReviewID": "fyQhE1g1BqjkLeHha1V3eg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Oh Alinea....My Boyfriend Adored eating here, and it was an experience of course. \u00a0I particularly loved the hot and cold potato soup....

I can't even describe this one because it was a medley of the strangest flavors popping in and out of my mouth. \u00a0This dish ends with a sip of watercress soup served beneath the jello.7) Halibut - black pepper, coffee, lemon: One of my favorite dishes of the night and presented in a snowy-white art form. \u00a0The fish was perfectly cooked, the hint of coffee flavor permeated occasionally, the crunchy \"shrimp chips\" and the flawless cream sauce played together in a strange, but perfect harmony. YUM.8) Rabbit - Parfait, rillett, consomm\u00e9: A three-tiered dish (literally, served in a 3 tiered cylindrical bowl) beginning with a cool rabbit parfait on the top layer that was creamy yet refreshing, culminated to a rabbit meat medley (a cube of shredded meat alongside a fried ball of meat) covered in king trumpet mushroom and surrounded by butternut sauce, and finally ending with a clear rabbit broth kept warm by a hot stone and flavored with a stick of cinnamon.9) Wlid mushrooms - pine, sumac, ramp: Loving this mushroom medley of wild mushrooms from the Fresno foothills in CA (what what)... weirdly spongy but super flavorful... another favorite.10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter: Another creative sip of soup served on a mini wax bowl with a pin poking through, spearing a bite of potato, black truffle, and frozen butter. \u00a0Pulling the pin releases these items into a cold potato broth... this dish was particularly different.11) Short Rib - olive, red wine, blackberry: Yet another favorite dish. \u00a0Earlier during dinner we were presented with 2 red \"flags\" in criss cross formation, which seemed a strange table decor. At this point we realized that this \"flag\" was an edible homemade tomato pasta. \u00a0This pasta was then draped over a metal, cradlelike contraption that made space for the most tender and tasty short rib I've ever eaten. \u00a0A plate of sides and sauces containing sea salt, olives, blackberry, sour cherry were all fair game to garnish this \"pasta short rib wrap\". \u00a0Likely the most luxurious \"wrap\" I will ever eat; I was blown away.12) Hamachi - West Indies spices, banana, ginger: served on a smoldering piece of cinnamon, this fried dish had a very \"Indian\" vibe to it although the banana felt like the centerpiece.13) Canard - a la Cussy: Lots of \"best of\"s during this meal, but this was the BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD. \u00a0A puff pastry stuffed with duck innards, foie gras, cock's crest (first time trying... it was good), and topped with the 3 most tender slices of duck I've ever had along with a tiny piece of fried duck skin. \u00a0I was getting really full at this point but I had to push through... 14) Venison - cherry, cocoa nib, eucalyptus: Once again, most tender piece of venison I've ever had. \u00a0Not gamey, served on a \"lily pad\" like presentation that covered the bite of deer heaven.To be continued... yelp's 5000 word limit can't stop me...", "Date": "2011-03-19", "Author_Location": "Berkeley, CA"}, {"Author": "Anisha A.", "ReviewID": "KJ6NvHo8YoxX0cLHJ5vYww", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit, I'm a sick, twisted person who went out of my way to find fault with Alinea.

There's not much to notice inside as well with the minimal decor, but you're not here for the atmosphere. You are here for the food, presentation and service.The food was amazing (I loved every little course), but the presentation was even better. Every course kept getting better and better (both taste and presentation), but it was the last dessert course that really blew me away.

The only tell-tale sign was the valet notice and doorman standing by the bare doors. I was greeted by a narrow neon red hallway and my world was suddenly transformed once the metal doors opened. The hostesses and servers operated seamlessly. After reconfirming our lack of dietary restrictions, our courses came promptly, one after another. All 20 of it.A set of 3 cocktail amuse bouche opened our tastebuds. A cooling sour lemon with sweet grapefruit, a spoonful of apple brandy hard jello and a shot on a stool of squash with foam on top. \u00a0Each one seems to be progressively stronger in alcohol taste. The GOLDEN TROUT ROE had light coconut flavours , and the zest of tangy-sweet pineapple. \u00a0What an interesting and unique combination of flavor that will always remind me of Chef Achatz!The Japanese inspired YUBA was a long crunchy twig that was wrapped with shrimp, sprinkled with sesame seeds and dipped with miso. Presented alongside with the Vietnamese inspired CHAO TOM which is a sugar cane cube infused with shrimp broth, topped with mint and chewed until the flavours are extracted. A beautiful twist to the traditional Vietnamese dish!The STRIPED BASS was complimented perfectly with sweet vanilla froth and sourness. \u00a0A pinch of black pepper and sesame, along with the light crackers gives it the crunch that contrasts flawlessly with the supple fish.A shot of CELERY JUICE held a shell of horseradish ball encasing apple juice. What an exotic flavor from everyday fruit and vegetable! The horseradish was slightly spicy like wasabi (which is made of horseradish) and the celery juice and apple juice mixed well together. A distinctive three layered dish of RABBIT Top layer; eat it like a parfait, a sheet of squash and pine nuts were accompanied by thin crunchy stems. Then rabbit rillette was accompanied by balls of potatoes? Afterwards, sip on the consomm\u00e9 made from the rich broth that soaked the cinnamon stick. Unfortunately, I thought this was a little salty for my liking.A smoky aroma filled the room; it was from the burning fig that held the PHEASANT TEMPURA with walnuts together. Light crunch, very unique and the pheasant was very tender but I'm not a big fan of walnuts. One of the most interesting dish was the create-your-own SHORT-RIB RAVIOLI with a variety ingredients of your choice! Including sea salt, olives, blackberry, onion etc. I made sure to put everything in my wrap. It was delicious, and the chilled pasta wrap was warmed by the slow braised short rib. The creativity and hands on experience does not end here!Next up was a shot of temperature sensitive POTATO with black truffle. Warm truffle paired with icy cold potato and mushroom. What a scrumptious sensation!Then our server poured us a GRAPE SODA to match with the extremely tender PIGEONNEAU on a light puff pastry. BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION blew up in my mouth! Keep your lips shut for this as you don't want luscious rich truffle spilling out of your lips! Cheesy, creamy truffle. MMM! A spoonful was delectable and satisfying.To pave the way to desserts, an unusual sweet-savory set of three came. A PINEAPPLE SUGAR SHEET dusted with ham flavoured powder. Be sure to eat it with the powder facing up and you'll keep the table powder-free! Slightly sugary, more savory. A crispy bacon glazed with butterscotch and a cup of liquefied caramel popcorn made a sweet drink. An exquisite transition from main course to dessert!An inflated pillow infused with earl grey permeated the room while we cut up EARL GREY COOKIE topped with white chocolate and crunchy strips. My favourite dessert is the tube of bubble gum flavoured CREME FRAICHE. Jelly like in the tube, suck it out and all three layers combined. A chewy consistency of mini tapioca balls and fruity-bubblegum flavoured. Ending the night was the full blown dessert, a CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM frozen by liquid nitrogen. Surrounded by huckleberries, nougat and a dollop of vanilla cream. The crisp sheet decorating the final piece stood out from the soft and cooling ice cream. Service was impeccable. Napkins replaced, water droplets and crumbs wiped off, each course explained thoroughly, and came and left in a syncronised fashion, gracefully and efficiently.***Tip: Business formal dress code suggested. We made reservations at least a month in advance. Cancellation costs $100 per person! Tasting menu was not that filling but still left me about 80% full. I liked being there at 5pm because we were the first ones to get seated and we were the first ones to get our food. Favourites: Very friendly service, not pretentious at all.

The restaurant was bustling with people. \u00a0There were a ton of people dining, and a ton of people working. \u00a0Everything was well partitioned, though.Service was good. \u00a0Somewhat robotic, but in a good way. \u00a0Somewhat casual, but in a \"not stuffy\" way--as opposed to a casual because we're lazy way. \u00a0We had 4 or 5 people who seemed to be serving us (we seemed to have two waiters, a few expeditors, sommelier for wine), but it still felt personal. \u00a0There was one minor service hiccup that was probably the result of too many people doing too much different stuff all at once; one of the waiters came to give us new glasses and take our glass of wine that was just freshly poured by another waiter less than a minute before. \u00a0We told him, and it was not a big deal at all. \u00a0The wait staff was willing to engage in conversation and even crack jokes, which is always welcomed by me. \u00a0Upon leaving, the waiter also led us to go inside the kitchen, which was also a nice treat.The food here is art, and many apparently feel the need to bring their cameras. \u00a0That's perfectly OK, but I wish everyone had enough respect for my $900 meal that they'd turn the flash off while taking pictures. \u00a0There were some great people watching opportunities. \u00a0Chico's was definitely in fashion for the women, many of the older women there were ber-stylish. \u00a0I'm not sure I agree that a \"jackets required\" policy for men is necessary for this type of restaurant. \u00a0There were a lot of men in unmatched blazers, and it just seemed unnecessary and too old school for such a cutting edge restaurant.The only question left somewhat unanswered in my eyes: is it really the #1 restaurant in the country--or even Chicago? \u00a0 We pondered it while we were there, looking around, wondering \"could it be?\" \u00a0I'm honestly not sure of it, but I'd put it at either #1 or #2 of the top dining experiences I've had (for those that are curious what the other contender would be, that would be Tru---but maybe that was exceptionally amazing to me given that we were in the semi-private dining room). \u00a0Alinea is a foodies paradise, and something everyone should experience. \u00a0It's definitely way up there in the rankings, and after going to a place like this most other restaurants will pale in comparison.", "Date": "2006-11-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jules D.", "ReviewID": "b-TUwDn3ygyZAWdRfuQPsg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Saturday night, party of 5, did the tour, two in our party did the full wine pairing, one requested a beer pairing.So many reviews that I will make this to the point...+ Food - amazing in presentation, originality, and taste (5 stars)+ Atmosphere - clean and modern (5 stars)+ Craig Sindelar (5 stars) Our sommelier was thrown for a loop and snippy with our table when a member of our party didn't care for wine and asked for a beer pairing. \u00a0He had to call in the head sommelier, Craig Sindelar, to assist. \u00a0Mr. Sindelar was absolutely knowledgeable and capable in meeting our needs.- Service 3- some very professional, some very pretentious, actually we were in ear shot of them making derogatory comments about other patrons all evening. \u00a0It distracted our table at times. \u00a0They spoke of how guache it was for one table to order a particular wine, how another table didn't use their utensils \"properly\", how someone seemed childish for being excited and in awe of finally going to Alinea. \u00a0I own the Alinea book and have identified some of these mean spirited people, but I won't publish the page numbers because I don't want to make them feel embarrassed as they did to others the evening I was there.Bottom line...it is a treat to dine on thoughtful and precise cuisine in such a beautiful atmosphere. \u00a0I applaud the genius of Mr. A and his team. \u00a0I will probably try it again and hope for more respectful service.", "Date": "2009-12-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Vivian Y.", "ReviewID": "f99TvELK6Ls4OniI67SgrQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are so lucky to have received a $300 gift certificate for Alinea for our wedding so we were able to come here but it was also an additional $400.00 out of pocket after tips. \u00a0(12 course tasting + wine pairing each, no other extras!!)Enjoy a little food porn from Alinea - I took these pictures myself and thank god we were seated downstairs which was nicely lit. \u00a0Alinea was awesome enough to let me take home a copy of the menu indicating all the dishes we ate too!

While the 12-course tasting menu will set you back $135 and a good four hours, it is unlike any culinary experience I've had yet.It may seem counterintuitive, but the best way to experience Alinea is without expectations. Yes, you've read the hype and you've heard the buzz about molecular gastronomy--but you've never had bacon for a palate cleanser and you've never dreamed of adding soy sauce to your dessert. So when you hear adjectives such as good, orgasmic, or weird, you're really only hearing expletives that are void of meaning. Because unless you've been intimately acquainted with the likes of Homaro Cantu, Heston Blumenthal, Wylie Dufresne, or Ferran Adria, you will really have no baseline with which to compare Alinea to.COURSE HiGHLIGHTSCourse 3: Monkfish - banana, onion, lime // Cauliflower. Our only other seafood dish was Monkfish (vegetarian Cauliflower), prepared in a mousse, tempura, and steamed with banana and lime sauces and garnished with an onion paper. Above all, this was a lesson in texture with the creamy mousse, crunchy tempura, and silky monkfish. The banana and lime sauces cooled the dish, while the onion paper dissolved swiftly in our mouths.Like any good lover, Achatz means only to give you a taste of what he's got in store for the rest of night. Our first four courses were merely child's play--dishes that were fathomable and gently teased us into oral foreplay. So just when we were starting to get bored...Course 5: Apple - horseradish, celery. We were told to throw back the shots and to open our mouths wide to take in the entire ball at once. Once inside, there was a cytoplasmic explosion of apple juice. It was strangely pleasant and slightly erotic all at once. Paying careful attention to the progression, this first eruption was gentle, easing us into the experience. Once the liquid went down, we were left with the essence of horseradish but with only a hint of its heat.The remainder of our savory courses paid homage to the regional cuisine with a Midwest-lean towards rich, protein heavy dishes. Course 6: Duck - mango, yogurt, pillow of lavender air // Turnip. The Duck (vegetarian Turnips) was prepared in a manner befitting of pork with duck rinds, duck bacon, and pulled duck. As with the other fruit sauces, the essence of mango really shone through and for added pizazz, the whole plate was set atop a pillow of lavender air, which diffused directly into our olfactory systems.Course 8: Black Truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan. Though it came sans meat, the Black Truffle ravioli was no less rich. Although benign looking, the pasta membrane actually housed a robust, truffle scented broth that exploded upon contact. The single ravioli captured the soul of an entire pasta dish and would have sated any craving for Italian, no matter how small or large.Course 10: Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme. Our prayers were answered when an interlude came announcing the arrival of dessert. While the vegetarians got a Honeydew jelly to cleanse their palates, we were served dehydrated Bacon. With the OC Fair currently in tow, it was a stone's throw away from a caramel apple. Served on a rocking apparatus, it was highly whimsical and an inventive way to bridge the salty to sweet transition.Our last and final dish was Course 14: Caramel - meyer lemon, cinnamon perfume. I will never understand how you tempura a viscous caramel and lemon, but the taste of churro sent me yearning for home. How many licks do you think it take to get to a center of a caramel tempura ball the size of a golf-ball? Alinea's answer is one.The staff read our minds (or eavesdropped on our conversation) and asked us if we wanted to see the kitchen at the stroke of midnight when our meal ended. The kitchen was starting to wind down, which gave Chef Chad a chance to explain to us the wax molds he was working on. No sign of Grant Achatz, but Chad was good enough eye candy for me.In closing, Alinea is not about what you do or don't like. It is about the appreciation of an unnamed sensation, a flavor that leaves you at a loss for words, and a culinary innovation that is only beginning to take flight in the United States. It is the technology of the early adopter and the beta version of a cuisine that is not yet commercially viable.Some art forms are more accessible to the intellect--others, just need to be studied to be appreciated.

I want to add that you cannot compare the expense to prior dining experiences, but rather to some other entertainment, or even travel. Here's a scenario: you get a couple choice tickets to the theater, orchestra, Hawks game, whatever ($200?), have a reasonably priced meal with wine for two before or after ($150?). There. You're about at the price for two for Alinea, and since Alinea dining averages four hours, you've spent the same amount of time either night. Compare the price to that, not to that of your (current) favorite restaurant. And I'm willing to bet that Alinea would be the one of the two options above that you remember for the rest of your life. It's definitely more out of this world. My wife and I do not have money fights. She's a teacher, I'm a community college mid-level administrator.

Due to the 24 courses, I won't write a bunch of comments about each, but rather primarily rank the dishes and mention the highlights for each dish. I prioritized the dished by a 1 (dishes I loved), 2 (dishes I thought were good) ,or 3 (dishes that I didn't care for). I had 11 #1s, 8 #2s, and 5 #3s. The pictures really do more justice for this place than my written review. To sum up this dinner, I'll say the same thing I told one of the sommeliers, \"Thank Grant's parents for having sex.\"#8 CroquetteCheese filled and one of the first times I thought salmon roe actually complimented a dish, rather than overwhelm it with salt.#19 OctopusThey hand this dish to you so I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it. A well prepared dish.#1ChanterelleThe presentation on this one was cool. It comes on the plate within a cylinder. Then, they pull the cylinder and the dish pours out on the plate. The flavor on the mushroom cream propelled this one to the top.#16 AppleFresh flavors of apple and celery. Cool interlude between dishes.#15 MonkfishThe monkfish was presented three ways: fried, grilled, and pate. Very good, but too normal for Alinea.#12 DuckThey bring this one out on a pillow that is filled with juniper air and then puncture it, so there is this aroma of juniper. Pretty cool. The dish itself was good, but not memorable.#7 Black truffleOne of the best tasting dishes I had. He knows how to use truffles. The serving dish was cool because it had an opening in the bottom. #6 Short ribOne of the best presented dishes I had, next to the coconut. Layered with Guinness (beer) gel, it looked liked a piece of art and tasted great. I could have done without the peanuts. The rating was more for the presentation.#20 Yuzu Nothing special to me, but the flavor was good. It was a yuzu flavored with saffron and sprinkled with powdered sugar.#10 ChestnutI love maple so it may be my bias. The chestnut base had a good flavor too.#11 PersimmonTwo things stood out on this one. The ginger liquid filled ball, it's explosive and I liked it. The brioche pudding was the star of this dish, very rich. I could bathe in this stuff.#14 Licorice cakeIt was a chocolate-licorice cake and it was well-executed, I could have done without the hay on the top. You are supposed to put the whole thing in your mouth without the use of your hands. I think women could learn a lot from this dish. #22 King crabNot for me. I didn't care for the gel around the crab and the rice on the side looked nice, nothing special on the flavor.#24 SkateRumor has it; the chef calls this one, Master of the Universe. I forgot to asked why they served it with bananas, it was odd to me. And way too much powder on the plate. It was the only dish that I thought didn't work. None of the flavors went together.#21 PinappleLike the yuzu, it was good, but nothing special. #4 LambOne of my favorite for the presentation and the quality of the lamb. I would consider it a simple dish, each lamb piece with a different sauce, but it was near perfect. I also liked the change to chopsticks. It was served on this hot coal that seared the bottom of the lamb. That's hot.#5 Hot potatoOne of his signature dishes and for good reason. It's a warm potato ball in a cold soup with truffles. You pull the pin out and the potato falls in the soup. Again, the presentation and the truffles make the dish.#18 VenisonJust way too much granola for the venison. Once you take the granola off, the meat goes well with the accompanying sauces.#13 Foie grasThis was the chef's complimentary dish. I just liked the fact that I could get foie gras in Chicago. It was a foie gras mouse encased in cinnamon bun dough. Sweet goes with foie gras and it worked well. #2 OrangeI'm certain there is cocaine in this dish. It's the one I still crave today. That olive oil ice cream is something Ben or Jerry should look into to. Looking around a lot of other people seems to like this dish, also.#3 CoconutI'll remember this one for some time. It had the best presentation of the evening. The coconut ribbon across the middle reminded of the 60s when brides use to wear white to weddings, I miss that color. Taste wise, the cornmeal cake was the star.#17 Chocolate - passionfruit, kaffir lime leaf, soyNot sure if it was the wine kicking in at the time, but I stared at the chocolate for a few minutes. Like in that one Seinfeld episode when Elaine stop having sex and she was starring at the tires go 'round and 'round. I just thought it was cool how they coiled the chocolate. #9 CaramelIt came wrapped around a cinnamon stick, crisp on the outside and a rich, juicy bite of caramel on the inside. Great dish.#23 BaconIt's just bacon with a strip of butterscotch. I would take this one off the menu.", "Date": "2007-02-27", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Merrill H.", "ReviewID": "ewX07S3XS8QHOxDtDwtunA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really can't top Monica T.'s review on the food, so I'm going to review their valet.

I've been wanting to eat here since I had satisfied my craving for the French Laundry a couple years ago. I was in town for a convention and totally had to make plans to come here. Originally I had signed up for the 12-course Tasting menu but my buddy who was also a foodie and I changed our minds to the 24-course Tour menu as we were waiting for our table in the lobby area. We asked if this was possible and the great Chef Achatz told our server that it wouldn't be a problem. Suffice it to say it was definitely a new and enlightening experience. I had never eaten at a progressive American/avant garde/molecular gastronomy restaurant before. This has definitely opened my eyes about what food is and can be. Every course was a mixture to tease all the senses. The presentations were beautiful and playful. The servers were knowledgeable and clear with their instructions on how to go about eating every work of art. The 24-courses came through pretty smoothly and quick, probably because we were on course to be the last ppl there that night. Our time there came at just under 4 hours so that was much appreciated. We also got Chef Achatz to sign our menus. As we were waiting for one of the staff to flag down a cab outside, I noticed the curtain to the entrance of the first level dining room slightly closed. So I peeked into the dining room and surprisingly saw Chef Achatz sitting with his back towards me at one of the tables with his laptop.

Once you figure out how to get in you have three or four friendly faces all ready to take care of you. It seems as though they could see you through the door. We were promptly brought to our table upstairs which I didn't find particularly comfortable. It was a little stuffy and sterile but I respect the modern aesthetic. Before I knew it, we were served the first course of Steelhead roe, curry, and coconut. This first dish was very bright and a great way to start the experience. We decided to go with the wine pairing as well which started with a champagne cocktail. Course after course came out of which three or four really stood out. The fourth course blew us away. Dashi broth was made at our table in a Japanese siphon coffee maker. Moments later a plate was laid before us with what looked exactly like tofu accompanied with daikon and carrot. Then the dashi was poured over the \"tofu\". Except the tofu wasn't tofu at all, but a scallop mousse that was fried. Not only did this morsel look like tofu, it had a consistency that was nearly identical to soft tofu. It was the first time during the meal that I started to understand what all the hype was about. The next dish to garner my attention was the \"lamb........?????....!!!!\". I've never been an enormous fan of lamb but that's because I didn't know it could be like this! The lamb came out perfectly cooked three ways; osso bucco, belly, and loin. It came with a wonderful jus or reduction of some kind which could have easily finished the dish. At Alinea they took what was a beautifully executed dish and ramped it up with a few condiments. Well... 60 condiments to be precise. They must have added a few since we visited, as they now call it Lamb 86. That dish was a lot of fun and tasted phenomenal. Immediately following our Lamb we were presented with a small dish called Truffle Explosion, which was exactly what it sounds like. Is there anywhere else in the world that has a truffle course? This little pouch punches you in the face with the most decadent umami flavor... I'm having a hard time coming up with the words to describe it... it's that good. Anyone that's familiar with Alinea and Grant Achatz is probably aware of the elaborate desserts they prepare. The final course certainly did not disappoint in that aspect. Painted table... cotton candy... liquid nitrogen. I'll let the rest be a surprise. There were, however, a few things about our four hour dinner I was not super excited about. The Wooly Pig comprised of ham and squid was good, but not great. It had nice texture but lacked a little in flavor. One of the last courses was a helium balloon of green apple. It was really sticky. A woman sitting next to us got it in her hair, which I'm sure she had a hard time getting out. It was fine, I suppose, if you like sour apple. In the chef's defense I would not say I love sour apple. That being said, I think he deserves a lot of props for figuring it out. It must have taken a lot of trial and error to perfect something like that, not to mention that it is the most whimsical thing I've ever eaten. I am really happy to have had the experience at Alinea but would not spend the money to do it again. I know Alinea is a molecular gastronomy restaurant but I wish they would lean just a little more towards perfecting the flavor and just a little less on the tricks. I love molecular gastronomy when done correctly, but I left that night deciding my next fine dining experience will be more on the rustic side. After we got home and looked up some of the wines, I realized just how expensive the wine pairing was. I intended to write that it was overpriced. However, I have never had wine paired with a meal so well, so that would not have been fair. I certainly don't regret it. After all, you are not just paying for the wine but for the knowledge the sommelier brings to the table and his ability to heighten your experience. That aspect of our evening was truly astounding. The biggest piece of advice I can offer if you're planning on dining at Alinea, is do not look up a bunch of videos and pictures of the courses you could possibly be served. This is one thing I truly regret. Being surprised from course to course would have been a lot more fun and enjoyable experience. I'm sure a restaurant like this changes their menu often, so hopefully I didn't ruin too much of it for you.

every piece is intricate - and most of the flavors are very good. \u00a0The ingredients are for the most part to-notch, and the wine accompaniment ( we chose the standard one over the more expensive one - our only choice of the evening ) generally worked well, though it was never made exactly clear how many courses a particular pour was meant to accompany. \u00a0We shared a wine pairing, which may have been too little for the amount of food - in contrast to our experience elsewhere and some advice here.At several points, we are led in anticipation by serving equipment being placed early or parts of the dishes being arranged some number of courses beforehand. \u00a0Some courses were served in multiple stages. \u00a0Some courses were prepared at the table in some way. \u00a0Dessert was impressive and tasted good too. \u00a0I'm not going to say much more - menus are only presented afterwards, and the intent is to surprise and delight. \u00a0You can look it all up if you like spoilers.Having said that the flavors are good, and the presentations are as innovative ( and at times beautiful ) as anything I can compare them to, I have to come to my main complaint about the food: it seems to exist in a cultural vacuum. \u00a0Modern food like this *needs* some context to it. \u00a0A place like The Fat Duck may have odd preparations, but they are always hung on some familiar context. \u00a0I was missing that context at Alinea. \u00a0I had many dishes which tasted wonderful, which were new and different and at times weird, but they did not, for the most part, make a connection for me with anything familiar. \u00a0Those which did attempt to connect themselves to a more familiar dish or serving method lacked any real sense of humor about it. \u00a0This is really where things fell flat to me. \u00a0I was plenty surprised, but not always delighted.I realize that this is an esoteric complaint. \u00a0But for me, it's what made this about the third best restaurant experience I had in a week in Chicago ... without even considering the price and the hype. \u00a0Frankly, my dinner at Moto later in the week stood up in all the places Alinea fell down.", "Date": "2011-07-06", "Author_Location": "Sunnyvale, CA"}, {"Author": "Steven E.", "ReviewID": "Ws-ej2XxC0Dd5MobZVe8dQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its an experience!! i had to go to McDonald's after!!", "Date": "2014-03-10", "Author_Location": "Rosemead, CA"}, {"Author": "eileen b.", "ReviewID": "cisCCoNuTs64aX53fsxRZg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people just go to dinner for food and drinks, but I want a complete dining experience and that's exactly what I got at Alinea.

Apparently this restaurant is really hard to book reservations for but luckily one of my friends called and they had a cancellation so they were able to fit us in last minute. First off this is a very unique restaurant. Totally different from any restaurant I have been to. It was an experience unlike any other. \u00a0It was entertaining and a feast for your eyes but I must admit not a feast for your tummy. You can definitely tell that the chef put much work and thought into the presentation of each dish.We ordered the tasting menu which came with 13 courses. Every course was unique and different. \u00a0Some courses were really good \u00a0but some I thought were just ok. You could do wine pairing with the dinner but we opted to order just a bottle of wine. Which I think is the smarter approach. The wine pairing cost an additional 120 per person on top of the 150 you are paying per person for the tasting menu, if I remembered correctly. It definitely was not a cheap meal and will take a big chunk out of your wallet.So why the three stars you might ask....the staff I thought were pretty uptight. We tried to take pictures of our food and at times our flash would accidently go off and they would come up to us right away and remind us that we need to stop using the flash. What's the big deal right, I am sure no one is bothered by it and if we are paying the price that we are paying I feel we should at least be able to take pictures freely. On top of that there was no music at all in the restaurant and it was really quiet. I felt so uncomfortable and felt like I couldn't talk or act freely. I felt like I was being watch like a hawk by the staff, it was not a very comfortable atmosphere at all. I wish the staff and atmosphere would have been a little more relaxed and chill, it would've made the experience so much better. Total price for the four of us was around 800 bucks. A big thanks to our friend who was so generous to treat us to this very pricey dinner.

You've heard the stories, or maybe you've read up on molecular gastronomy. Then you arrive and the doorman gestures toward a dark, Willy Wonka-esque hallway that gets more narrow with each step. You think you've hit a dead end when, seemingly out of nowhere, a door slides gracefully open. As you gaze upon the host's smiling face, you realize: that moment outside wasn't a moment after all. This feeling is going to last as long as your dining experience does.And so, it begins. Each course will come out, meticulously plated, with an experienced and friendly waiter right beside you, explaining how to eat what's been set forth in front of you. Without giving away too many specifics of the ever-changing menu, I will say you're likely to find yourself sucking up one course through a test tube, kissing another, eating one course without any hands, and another directly off the table.Intrigued? Then I'll continue!Should you choose to do wine pairings with each course, which I strongly recommend, the sommelier will pour you a smorgasbord of varietals, including a few you've probably never heard of before (ie: Zibibbo). With each pour, there will be an accompanying story about where the wine came from, and why the flavors within make it the perfect pairing.Overall: Grant Achatz's progressive style of cuisine is pure genius, and the experience is joyous and genuinely enchanting.

I maintain a fantasy to do list that helps me keep track of restaurants, hotels and attraction all over the world that I want to try. Trio in Evanston, IL was on that list but every time I visited Chicago I couldn't justify taking a long cab ride into an area I was unfamiliar with just for a meal. Then one day I read in some travel magazine that Grant Achatz was opening his own restaurant in the city. I was about six weeks out from my next trip to Chicago so I made a reservation. There isn't much I can say that the 180 reviewers before me haven't already said but I'll put my own twist on the Alinea experience. And forgive me if this analogy is a little crude but I think it works. Alinea is to eating what a Roman orgy is to sex. There I said it and I'm going to stand by it. Alinea is over the top and unlike anything else in the mortal world when it comes to food. Once you sit down in your normal chair at a normal table you will have done the last familiar thing that you typically associate with eating. Is the food served on a plate or in a bowl? No....well at least it isn't for most course. Do you eat it with a fork or spoon? Typically not. Will you eat food in ways you never imagined? Yes. And that is part of what makes Alinea so special. When I signed up for the 27 course with a wine pairing I expected it to follow a traditional tasting menu. Begin with an amuse bouche, move onto an appetizer or two, soup, salad, fish fowl, beef, cheese, dessert, petit fours, check, pay and goodnight. As each course progresses the wines grow darker and bolder and end with something sweet and syrupy. Not so at Alinea. You are all over the place right out of the gate switching from beef to fish to vegetables to soup. And the wines bounce back from red to white to sparkling to port. And it works. In fact it works so well that I am surprised more restaurants aren't trying to break the mold and copy Mr. Achatz. The service is flawless and anything but intimidating. Each server is very well educated on the preparation of each dish as well as the origins of the ingredients. Being a total food geek I asked several questions about each course all of which were answered as if I had sent in my inquires prior to my arrival. Alinea is expensive but if you love food and want to be entertained for four hours in addition to being very well fed it is worth every penny. I'm going back in 2009 and can hardly wait.

The center of the dish is what \"seafood chowder\" would taste like if they served it in Heaven. \u00a0Clams and Scallops in cream but with fresh celery, herb sprigs, and a surprisingly sweet addition of tiny melon balls.Tomato with olive oil \"snow\" and olive-fig \"chocolate\" sauce. \u00a0Served with fresh figs with a large tomato plant brought to the table to proved an \"aroma\" addition to the course.Butterscotch Bacon and Japanese Cedar Smoked Date Parfait.Foie Gras with Fennel and Shiso (Japanese Mint) on a fork - just warm enough the Foie Gras melts like butter in your mouth with savory delight and a slight crunch from the Fennel. As you finish the Foie Gras, you drink the fresh Japanese Peach juice in the bottom of the glass for an explosion of lightly sweet fruit that clings to the fats on your tongue from the Foie Gras.Crab Parfait. This one was hard to wrap my brain around. The flavors were of ginger, spices, and carrots - like a delicious carrot cake. The texture was like a fluffy and airy parfait. Then at the bottom was *POW* king crab in gelatinized duck fat. The contrast of the flavors and textures was basically overstimulating all my taste buds.Two types of Rhubarb on Goat's Milk Cheesecake: A freeze-dried crunchy rhubarb sorbet and a transparent rhubarb \"glass\".

The weight of the plates slowly diffuses lavender from the pillow into your table area as you eat the delicious cheesecake and rhubarb dessert.All the food was absolutely amazing and definitely 5 stars. \u00a0The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I also got the wine paring (which raises the price to $500/pp from $300/pp after tax and tip) and I felt the wine pairing was not worth the extra $200. \u00a0I guess I am pickier with my wines and prefer mostly earthy reds -- the wine pairing was mostly whites, champaign, and a strong aquavit (and fire-water is not ideally the first thing they should serve on an empty stomach for a 25 course meal).I would highly recommend the tour with just one or two glasses of wine or beverage ala carte and you will save about $160-170 over the full pairing.", "Date": "2009-08-30", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sheena M.", "ReviewID": "g2y3-XbTL6HdR_FfiNC9Gw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have you ever been to Wonderland? How about Oz? I have, in the form of Alinea. I never knew these whimsical places actually existed until I brought my palate here. Course after course I fell deeper down the rabbit hole. Words like creative and unique don't even come close to describing the fare served at Alinea. Grant Achatz really is our modern day Willy Wonka.As our 4 year anniversary approached we really felt there was no where more suiting than Alinea to spend it in. Chicago has become a favorite city of ours and I, a huge fan or Mr. Achatz. We made our reservation for the 29 course \"tour\" menu and started counting down the days. As we made our way down the pink glowing hallway my heart was racing with excitement. Even though we were 30 minutes early for our reservation, we were greeted by name and sat anyway. We made our way up the stairs my eyes darting, looking for even a small clue as to what our evening would bring us. The minimalistic decor provides a blank backdrop so the food really is the star. A caterpillar like cascade of purple flowers sat behind our dinner table and set the tone for the whimsy to come. The overall feel of the atmosphere is genuinely fun. There was a level of service and class without it feeling stuffy or pretentious. No dish was ever explained in a condescending manner, no waiter was rude, and the room filled with laughter as the courses continued to arrive. \u00a0Some dishes shined more than others, some were true to the \"molecular gastronomy\" fad, while others simply showcased simple and amazing flavors. The dishes to me that were the greatest stars of the night were as follows:Course 5- A do-it-your-self pork belly spring roll. At the beginning of the meal we were presented with 2 sheets of rice paper beautifully draped over a small wooden stand. In the papers were flowers and herbs. When the course arrived, we assisted in constructing a sort of tee-pee for the rice paper to sit in. Sweet and succulent coconut curried pork belly was spooned into the center and you chose your own additions off of a plate of 11 ingredients. I choose black sea salt, lime, onion, and additional herbs. I wrapped it all up and was wrapped up in the flavors of that dish the whole night. It was by far my favorite. It was like Thai street food made glamorous. Course 10- Thai banana with a square of frozen Guinness beer with mustard and pecans. I truly wished this course was more than one bite, it was the definition of balance. Course 12- Powdered peanut butter, when mixed with your saliva returned to an original creamy peanut butter texture followed by Cayenne pepper. In terms of creativity, I felt this dish stood out amongst the rest. The way the flavors developed from peanut to pepper was indescribable. Course 13- Foie Gras, which seemed to be frozen, pushed through a sieve, over pear and white wine sorbet. My boyfriend and I both couldn't stop talking about this dish. It was like heavenly Foie ice cream. I wanted another scoop! Course 18- Part of what was called \"cocktail hour at Alinea\". A passion fruit Hurricane with all the traditional New Orleans flavors. This drink was like first sip of ice cold Kool-aid on a hot summer day when you are 8 years old. It was perfection.Course 23- One pound cake bite with strawberry and lemon sitting on a bed of almond sugar. We were literally instructed to enjoy this dish like fun-dip. Eat the pound cake then lick the vanilla bean and scoop up the almond sugar. Besides the fact that it was pound cake perfection, any chef who uses fun-dip as inspiration gets an A in my book!Course 27- Earl gray cookies, lemon custard, candied pine nuts, and caramelized white chocolate served on a pillow of Earl Grey scented air. Can I say anymore? This dish was really like cookies and childhood. It was playful, rich, sweet, and had a wonderful presentation.5 hours later, I was on a culinary high. My belly was near the point of exploding, but it was all well worth it. I love that the whole meal brought you home and brought you back to childhood. The raspberry transparency was like a grown-up fruit roll up. I even caught myself making little faces as I ate it. I loved course 24, which involved us sucking gelee (grown-up Jell-O), creme fraiche (grown-up pudding), and Bubble Yum out of a tube. What is more fun than that? Even the playful nature of the dessert that is prepared on your table was simply a chef playing with food.

When you go to Alinea, be prepared to have your world spun around and turned completely upside down because this experience will completely change the way you think about food (in a good way, of course). Alinea might have just been named the best restaurant in the US (#7 in the world) for 2010, but to me Alinea will always be one of the best experience I've ever had in my life. Chef Achatz have done everything from the minimalistic decor, the use of scents in some of his dishes (lavender air slowly coming out of a pillow that your plate is sitting on), the use of visuals (\"plating\" food on a silicone mat on your table right in front of you), the use of unique serving \"vessels\" (a piece of bacon sitting on a swing, come on man!!) to get you to indulge in your senses during your time at Alinea. The \"truffle explosion\" that I had was probably the best bite I've EVER had in my life. I'd love nothing more than to find the remote control that control my life and just hit pause there for a little while (and then maybe rewind and play in slow motion after that). For what it's worth, I would recommend the tasting menu (~12 courses) as opposed to the tour menu (~20 courses). I left feeling pretty full (and a little drunk) after doing the tasting. Do yourself a favor and go with the wine pairings. Some of the pairings were unbelievable!!! I think that night we ended up getting 14 courses with 9 different wine pairings!!The bottom line is that, yes, this is an outrageous price to be paying for a meal (especially with the wine pairing). But this is a once in a lifetime type experience (unless you've just got a lot of money to burn). You're pretty much paying a premium for perfection. Know that EVERYTHING has been thought out as to make you experience what the geniuses at Alinea want you to experience. You just have to hang on for a few hours for the ride of your life.Note: I called ahead to ask about the camera policy (I didn't want to be rude and understand why some restaurants just don't allow photos all together). But Alinea only forbid flash photography (just turn up your ISO and turn off your flash).

As much as I consider myself a foodie, I'm just not big on writing about food. And even though I've had the pleasure of \"collecting\" over 20 Michelin stars from dining standards like Wolfgang Puck's Spago to bucket-list restaurants like Thomas Keller's The French Laundry and Per Se over the past few years, I've never really felt compelled to write a review about any of them. Then I dined at Alinea, Grant Achatz's Michelin three-starred restaurant in Chicago at the forefront of American molecular gastronomy.FOOD: First things first: at Alinea, unlike the aforementioned The French Laundry and Per Se, food is as much about spectacle as it is about taste. The plating and presentation of the dishes here were by far the most creative I've ever experienced. A few were gimmicky (e.g. four pieces of seafood entangled in seaweed atop a giant piece of driftwood), but most were functional - and all were extremely fun, especially the green apple balloon and the \"cracked\" white chocolate egg. Now if you're worried that Chef Achatz is all style and no substance - as I was - let me reassure you: some of his dishes were among the best I've ever eaten. The aforementioned \"four pieces of seafood\" were the best bites of crab, lobster, and clam I've ever had, the corn dish was out of this world, and you can't go wrong with two of Chef Achatz's signature dishes: \"Hot Potato, Cold Potato\" and \"Black Truffle Explosion.\" My sister and I also went to town on the final dessert, the \"cracked\" white chocolate egg that covered the entire table, and finished the entire thing, which was no easy feat considering it was the 19th and final course - and also the largest.SERVICE: Like any Michelin-starred restaurant, the service here is top-notch - dishes always arrived with razor-like synchronicity, every course was explained thoroughly, crumbs were always brushed away, and my wine glass was never left empty. If I have one complaint, it's that I felt the service here was a bit more relaxed than what I've experienced at Thomas Keller's restaurants or at Joel Robuchon's three Tokyo establishments. The servers were always professional, but they had a more casual attitude than what I'm used to at restaurants of this caliber. Some people don't like the \"stuffy\" atmosphere of fine dining restaurants, but if I'm gonna pay an arm and a leg for a meal fit for a king, I don't mind being treated like one.AMBIANCE: Other than the darkened entrance hall with its neon outlines and grassy walkway, I was not particularly impressed by the decor of the restaurant - it's mainly black and white with accent lighting in various shades of neon. But I think that's kind of the point. Each of the food presentations here is like its own work of art, so the restaurant itself is like the blank canvas upon which these works of art are presented. Nowhere was this more obvious than during the \"cracked\" white chocolate egg dessert course, which utilized the entire table - covered with a latex tablecloth, of course - as a canvas. I will say, though, that the noise level in the restaurant was a bit on the louder end, which again created a more casual atmosphere than what I'm used to at Michelin-starred restaurants.VERDICT: I'm not an easily impressed diner, and I don't like writing food reviews. But Alinea surpassed all of my expectations and then some, and my dining experience here prompted me to do the unthinkable: to write a review on Yelp!. And that's just it - you don't just have dinner at Alinea; you have a DINING EXPERIENCE.

Your Welcome! Respectfully, -Alinea- Now, let's begin this review. 5 stars across the board. This is a dining experience...a whimsical adventure using the best of your senses for food. Smell, Sight, Taste. The haute cuisine is like no other in America. They have been heralded the closest successor we may see of \"El Bulli\" recently, speaking to the immense impact they have had on the culinary world. The beauty of Alinea is the focus on one ingredient in each dish and bringing it to life. Surprisingly it is usually NOT the ingredient you would suspect, making it so much more interesting. Example: dishes based off Hay, Chestnut and Rhubarb to name a few. Don't worry, Duck, Waygu, Truffle and many others are there as well but those are luxuries you would expect! Course after course you are drawn into the dish with strong scents while you are instructed to close your eyes....or Sight, while you marvel at the presentation of a dish. It's something you should never miss. The service is unlike any I have ever seen, your \"team\" of wait staff help bring the dishes, share insight on the construction of the dish, explain the wine pairings and quickly get you set for the next course. Warning - This is an expensive meal and is not meant to fill you. This is about the passion of food being on display like the art it truly can be when a chef isn't afraid to break out of the mold and turn it into something exquisite.

Alinea has a vast wine list that is filled with treasures that are surprisingly (relatively!) reasonably priced at a fraction of the markup of many high end restaurants. Sadly, though, unless you're dining with a big party, it's pretty impracticable to limit yourself to a single full bottle for a meal that covers the entire spectrum of familiar flavors (plus some that are totally new to even well experienced first-timers.)

I've been to quite a few michelin starred restaurants previously such as French Laundry, Chez Dominique, Village Pub, Spruce, Lumiere, L2O, etc. These were very good restaurants. However, Alinea has really brought food, and good food to a different level. The courses themselves were tasty and mind-blowing. Further, they made the whole dining experience very unique and seamless. First, they had completely avant garde ways of presenting food by going beyond the conventional utensils such as forks and knives. They would serve food on seaweeds, a tube, and a rack, etc. (yes, I did say a tube). All these would become gimmicks if the food themselves were lackluster. However, the food was incredible!Chef Achatz and his team really know how to play with texture, flavor and temperature. I can spend the whole day talking about each course, there're a few really stood out in terms of contrasting different textures, flavors, and temperatures. The hot potato cold potato, the tempura shrimp vanilla bean stick skewer, liquid black truffle ravioli, etc. \u00a0They offered not boring small dishes in between courses to make you marvel: how did they do it? such as the thin layer of shaved ice frozen on a cone like ceramic holder, all I could taste was refreshingly lemony flavors in the texture of snow! One of the desserts definitely made me fall in love faster than ever. There were so many tiny various sizes of cubes in different flavors, on the plate, there was some small swirl of sauces. Each of them were small, but each of them had an explosion of flavors!! I was almost moved to tears...:)The course-to-course pace was well managed. The servers were amiable, professional and knowledgeable. We also ordered wine paring, the wine concierge was great.The whole dining experience was like an amazing show, with seamless flow, excellent performance and wonderful surprises. We really felt like we looked at food differently after Alinea. The experience was memorable. Excellency doesn't come with a cheap price tag. :) The meal for two people including wine paring came down as close to one thousand dollars.

Walking in, however, we were transformed into a truly magical experience with decor that was stupendous.We had the 13 course tasting menu and enjoyed every minute of it. The presentation of each course was amazing and the food really good. If there is one thing both of us questioned, it was the sheer volume of pureed or \"foamy\" foods. I did get a feeling much of what we were eating was prepared earlier, which is a bit disapppointing.Service was better than I expected. I can afford, thank God, this kind of restaurant and pretty much any restaurant in Chicago. Yet, I don't feel I have to act like I can, nor do I feel the servers must be snobby to make me feel special. I KNOW this is a special restaurant and I know that only certain people can afford it. But SOME (not all) of the staff were a bit pretentious. Could they afford to eat there if they did not work there?My particular server was really good, and I liked the fact that the entire staff worked together to ensure your meal was always moving.After the meal, we took a peak into the kitchen with our waiter and about a week later we received an autographed copy of our menu, which really meant a lot to us.Would I go here again?

Well, it happened to me, and truthfully, I almost couldn't go. \"Couldn't go??\" you shout? \"Are you crazy!?\" Well, working until 9pm on a Wednesday night leaves little room to arrive at a 9:30 reservation. But thanks to my managers who let me leave early and the fact that I changed, met my boyfriend, and practically broke the speed of sound driving there, we arrived right on time! ::phew::Now to the main event. I was so nervous walking in, it was almost as if I was going to meet the President rather than sitting down to dinner. You walk down a long corridor and sliding doors open where lovely servers greet you warmly. To your right, you catch a glimpse of the kitchen where the best food is being prepared just for you. How exciting!My boyfriend, his friend, and I were seated upstairs. We were fully prepared to do the 23 course \"tour\" as it is called, but we did not get the wine pairings with it. Instead, we were encouraged to try a nearly 30 year old wine that would go with almost everything we tried that night. We were given nothing but the best service, knowledge about what we were trying, and care. Alinea loves you. And you can't help but love it back. I can't count the number of times my boyfriend and I looked in awe over our friend's head at what wonderful treats we would be given next. We were scolded like children for not answering a question or paying attention to a story. But it can hardly be helped! When you are given pheasant tempura skewered on a burning branch of oak leaves, or a tube of long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche to mimic the taste of bubble gum, what else can you do but gasp in delight like a 5 year old meeting Mickey Mouse for the first time at Disney World?? \u00a0You clap your hands in delight and close your eyes encasing every taste, smell, and sound your senses explode upon you. It's like a dream you never want to end. But end it does, and what an ending! The table cloth removed, and a special silicone mat placed over the table. Two chefs come out (one of them being none other than Grant Achatz himself!) and pour an overwhelming amount of freeze dried blueberries, chocolate mousse, and even a tobacco sauce all over the table! We were given nothing but a spoon and then we had to duke it out on who ate what and got the last bites. The servers were funny, caring, and catered to all our needs. We asked questions, we engaged them in conversation, and there was nothing but smiles all around.They weren't pretentious or snobby.

The creativity and service are all 5 stars, but food was just a big disappointment. Of all the Michelin star restaurants I've tried, this is the priciest and my least favorite. (Best would probably be 11 Madison) Since everyone here has already raved about the food, I'll just focus on what didn't work for me. I came in Feb. so walking in you go through a little grove of pine trees and emerge to the restaurant. Simple and chic. They have you wait a little with an amuse/starter of hot chocolate infused with what I can only imagine as the same pine trees that we walked through. My first thoughts were, this is too sweet and I don't particularly like the taste of pine trees with my hot chocolate. Creative, yes. Taste, not at all, it reminded me of Christmas pine scented candles. I pushed that out of my mind as I figured the rest of the meal would be fabulous.The time we came, the menu seemed to have a lot of Asian influence. One set of the courses was a beautiful tower of water with flowers and ice. They then served a couple of pieces of sashimi fish skewered on lemon grass and two slices of raw scallop. You are to dip in the hot broth that's accompanied with it and there was also a hot stone that you can cook on. Very interactive and fun, but taste wise I was underwhelmed. I've had scallops in many forms, this was two slices that I felt I could have gotten at any nice sushi restaurant. There was a soy dipping sauce for the fish, that was to my liking, but it's also exactly the same thing that my dad makes at home with a whole steamed fish, nothing new here. There was also a fried shrimp head, again, available at any sushi restaurant. To me it wasn't inventive and the flavors has been done, I came here to taste things that I've never tasted before and half the courses ended up being things I can eat on a regular basis at home. There was also another mushroom dish, the waiter took time to describe it, it's not a common known mushroom, huitlacoche, but again I've had it before, at a street taco stand, the mushroom tasted similar, I was not wowed by street taco mushrooms. There was a mole inspired dish, that was my BF's favorite. That was probably the Mexican theme part of the meal. We also had the duck three ways with the assortment of sauces/sides. This was fun to try and pleasing to the eye, but not delicious as I had hoped. 90% of the sauces were inedible to me and made no sense as something that would pair well with duck, I felt like it's just put on there because it's different. The duck was also not the best. There was foie which I was looking forward to, but it was a small abysmal piece. Gary Danko had the best foie (too bad not anymore). \u00a0There was a palate cleanser of ginger. Literally 5 tiny pieces of ginger on metal skewers, the concept failed me, barely half a bite if you put it all together and I didn't like any of the flavors. To me it actually killed my palate because some of the pieces the ginger flavor was just too strong. Dessert was also a fail. It was these three sorbet/ice cream flavors, but all I can remember is that one of them was carrot flavor. And it tasted just like that, cold creamy carrot flavored baby food. Ended with the elaborate show of the frozen chocolate ball and ice cream made on your table. Fun to watch, not fun to eat. The flash freezing of the ice cream didn't create a good mouth texture of the ice cream and also ruined the pieces of cake that was in there as well.The dishes that I actually enjoyed seemed to be some permanent ones. The hot cold potato and the mushroom ravioli. Each one the flavors were \u00a0very intense for the small package it came in. I also liked the helium balloon, fun AND delicious. Overall, left hungry still (BF ended up scarfing down leftover fried chicken and Indian food later that night) and disappointed at the meal we had.

There are moments of disbelief interspersed with instances of revelation, leaving you with a jumble of incredulous memories composed of a myriad of fantastic sights, smells, and tastes.The two tasting menu options have now been replaced with a single 21 dish tasting for $185, keeping in mind that some of these 21 \"dishes\" are a small plate that may arrive with 2 or 3 others to be served together as a single course, for a total of 16 courses. \u00a0The wine pairings are offered inconspicuously for a mere additional \"three quarters\" of the price of the tasting.The flavours are amazing. \u00a0Delicate spheres of sherry explode with each mouthful, its sweetness cutting into the richness of the freeze-dried pea puree, interspersed with the savoury highlights of powdered Iberico ham. \u00a0The intensity of the tomato dish blew my mind - it is hard to believe that each tomato was simply blanched and dressed with only olive oil, salt and pepper, and still able to produce a natural depth of flavour that I often associate with hours of braising or meticulous reduction.The play and exposition of flavour profiles also produced spectacular results. \u00a0King crab and plum became the basis of a three-dish course, each revealed in turn after the completion of the former. \u00a0The essential components remained evident and undisturbed, but the course flowed smoothly from a cold king crab and buttermilk parfait with chervil juice; \u00a0to a crisp salad of king crab with fennel, plum, and bean sprouts; and then finishing off with a lush, piping gratin of king crab, punctuated perfectly with a delightful star anise encapsulation.And if you have any predilection for truffles, you will not be disappointed. \u00a0The classic hot potato dish still remains topped with the largest slice of black truffle I will probably ever eat in one mouthful, and the black truffle \"explosion\" will literally stop you in your tracks. \u00a0Heed the waiter's warning to eat the delicate ravioli in one go, as there is no room for regret if you spill even one drop of the most intense, jaw dropping truffle broth that literally explodes in your mouth and simply overwhelms all your senses with pure deliciousness.Playful themes that engage and delight will continue to meet you at every turn throughout the night. \u00a0Deconstructions and re-interpretations of classic cocktails start off the meal. \u00a0South-east Asian flavours will meet you in their presentations of pork belly wraps and shrimp. \u00a0A shout out to Escoffier makes an entrance, accompanied with period-appropriate placings and cutlery, and a splash of red wine to complete the picture. \u00a0Nothing happens by accident, as every moment is conceived and carried out to a tee. \u00a0Granted, this does require the omnipresent hovering of wait staff which does make you feel watched at every moment (which you are), but it does serve the purpose of making sure that you have the most perfectly executed meal you could hope for. \u00a0Service is so catered to making sure you are happy that we were given complimentary cocktails simply because the bottle of white we ordered was not immediately available and had to be chilled (we promptly received our bottle only about 2 courses after we received our cocktails!). I am tempted to go on and on, but the degree of detail, thoughtfulness, and creativity (and of course, deliciousness!) is simply something you have to try for yourself. \u00a0A meal at Alinea is absolutely worth it, and will be unlike anything else you will have ever experienced.And yes, I saved my 100th review for Alinea. \u00a0: )", "Date": "2010-08-29", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Rhoda G.", "ReviewID": "m7hZcydyyz36sGji7SkuaQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting for a couple of years to try this place and figured it's a good 30th birthday present to myself.

This is a healthy portion - a whole fish split between two people. \u00a0Reviews had said to be careful to not eat too much of this to save room for the rest of the meal. \u00a0At the end, we wished we had cleaned the bones on this Bass.10. \u00a0Hot Potato - as good as I remembered it! \u00a0The Parmesan and Truffle really make this dish.11. \u00a0Wild Mushrooms - I loved this dish but also LOVE mushrooms. \u00a012. \u00a0Venison - this was another of my favorites. \u00a0You basically make a cabbage wrap with mustard, bacon, venison, and a few other accompaniments, and the flavors explode in your mouth.13. \u00a0Black Truffle - Another masterpiece and debatably as good as Hot Potato. \u00a0I'm partial to Truffles. \u00a014. \u00a0Squab - the waiter arranges a bunch of forks and spoons on the table in front of you, one of which has the squab and the rest have different bites to go with it. \u00a0You eat them one by one, dropping the forks and spoons into a bucket. \u00a0This dish was more about presentation than substance (though wasn't bad).15. \u00a0Anjou Pear served with Brie. \u00a0I was excited for this dish as love warm Brie. \u00a0I feel like the Brie could have been stronger as I only tasted the Pear.16. \u00a0Ginger. \u00a0Five small pieces of ginger with varying intensity levels. \u00a0A nice pallet cleanser. \u00a017. \u00a0Winter. \u00a0This was delicious! \u00a0See the picture for presentation but basically the white \"snow\" was minty and melted in your mouth. \u00a0So light and refreshing!18. \u00a0Balloon. A green apple, helium infused balloon. \u00a0Fun to talk with helium, especially after all the wine pairings! \u00a019. \u00a0Dark Chocolate. \u00a0Much written about, one of the chefs (Grant wasn't in the house) brought out a hollow chocolate ball filled with crackers (?), cotton candy, and more chocolate and smashed it on a table drizzled with three sauces (butternut squash, lingonberry and stout). \u00a0I would have much, much preferred that the sauces be salted caramel and peanut butter as I am a freak and don't like chocolate and fruit together. \u00a0Great concept and a fun end to our 3.5 hour experience!My friend and I both had the wine pairings though I asked for \"short\" pours as Alinea has the reputation for pouring heavy, and I wanted to remember all of the meal! \u00a0Neither of us felt like we had that much wine by the end of the evening, and I wouldn't be scared to get full pours next time! \u00a0There were a healthy number of sweeter wines. \u00a0I'm usually not a fan of sweet wine or port but these seemed to work well with the food.In terms of service, what I especially appreciate about Alinea is the lack of pretentiousness of the waitstaff. \u00a0They're engaging and unobtrusive. \u00a0 My only complaint was when the bill came, we had been charged $16 for a coffee and espresso. \u00a0Seems a bit steep, no?What separates Alinea from other restaurants of this caliber is the uniqueness in the food and preparation. \u00a0Pure genious...", "Date": "2012-02-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Martin L.", "ReviewID": "Y_NsZIoUyDjp4qdX5wIkUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think Alinea and Next can stick there e tickets up there butt.

It could be due to laziness but let's use the \"too amazing to put into words\" excuse.Alinea shouldn't be listed as a restaurant and instead as an experience or Chicago attraction. Everything in your environment is mute so you can use all of your sense to engage the food. Achatz and his incredible staff are in the business of creating 'awe'.We dined here during the fall and were lucky enough to be one of the first seatings to experience the new menu for that season. We chose the twenty three course tour and set out for a two and a half hour long culinary experience. Our sommelier guided us to eventually choosing a thirty year old Riesling which was excellent and paired well with most of our courses. He was extremely knowledgeable and I learned a great deal since I'm not a huge wine drinker.I'm not going to go over each course since that would take forever and having been so long since I was there, an injustice to them. Each course was amazing, the combination of flavor profiles, textures, presentation and smell was impeccable. Each ingredient melded well with everything else on the plate and the course following it. Not only are the flavors well developed but the methods for delivery are too. It's a very interactive experience in which you will eat food in unconventional ways. The real highlight for us was when Grant Achatz came table side to prepare Chocolate. We all tried to think of something witty to say as this occurred but the spectacle just took over and I'm pretty sure I personally just stared like a kid meeting his sports hero and maybe muttered \"AWESOME\" a couple times. By far this is the best food experience you can find in Chicago.The waitstaff were a little austere at first but warmed up a great deal once they saw that we were here to really enjoy the food and not just sit here for the upper class brownie points. They worked with the kitchen to pace the courses just right. They answered our bevy of questions and even joked a round a bit once the dining room cleared out some (we had a late seating). When we were winding down to the last few courses they chatted with us and we talked about other spots in the city. Chef Achatz was nice enough to autograph our menus and then we were on our merry way. Twenty three courses does leave you just a tiny bit full, but manageable. Dining here is going to take some planning. Reservations can top out a month or more ahead of time and it's spendy. I believe the bill came to about $850 for three of us with drinks before gratuity. It's a very special experience that I would recommend having at least once.

This means that each course is a big adventure (although they do ask you beforehand if there's anything you're allergic to, so they don't inadvertently kill you).Next, each course is interactive. Instead of just passively sitting there while each dish is placed before you and then using the usual boring knife and fork, you actually have to DO different things to enjoy each course. There are courses that you eat with your fingers; tidbits of food on a skewer where you have to lean forward and bite it off; fresh greens growing in a centerpiece of real soil which you harvest for your salad yourself by snipping them off with manicure scissors; liquid courses that you suck out of a tube; dishes that come apart and have to be assembled a certain way before you can combine the different ingredients to complete the entr\u00e9e. \u00a0Then there are all the surprising blends of different flavors: salty steelhead roe eggs with sweet watermelon mousse; hamachi deep-fried with banana and ginger; a cheese-flavored ravioli with a liquid center of black truffle; chocolate with red pepper sauce.The creativity, attention to detail, and formal presentation devoted to each dish is incredible. Our dessert was literally a work of art which was created right in front of us -- by head chef Grant Achatz himself, we later found out -- before we were allowed to eat it by scraping it off the surface of the table (which had been covered with a practical rubber tablecloth beforehand).

Here, it's perfectly acceptable to lick your fingers (although they do provide hot towels for the especially messy finger foods) and otherwise enjoy yourself.

The wine pairing for the tour was a bit too much.Luckily our table was in the smaller back room -- I say luckily because the other dining areas looked, well, not as cool.Oh and the sommelier is one seriously opinionated person!

Centerpieces come and go, each anticipating some later dish to come but temporarily remaining enigmatic and vaguely inorganic objects vaguely conceivable as food.

The wait staff is immaculately attentative and do a good job throughout the meal of offering explanations and backstories as to the chef's inspiration and intended concept. What I really enjoyed about Chef Achatz's cuisine was that, besides being obviously avant-garde and exquisite, it's really just quite tasty. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, but at the end of the day I still tend to usually prefer food that's more on the comfort-food end of the spectrum. Despite the inventive presentation and combinations of flavors, many of the dishes I sampled here during my meal thrust forth flavors that were ultimately quite fundamental and familiar. Chef Achatz manages to retain essentially the heart and soul of many various cuisines from around the world and convey some core essence of the food despite dressing it up in his particular style. There was nothing on my menu that I thought was particularly out-there in terms of its flavor notes, but days after my meal I'm still thinking about and craving this or that dish. Beyond the hype and aesthetics Alinea also excels at the substance of food, cooking each morsel to perfection and deftly distilling its flavor notes to a pure and robust core.

With such status, I had extremely high expectations and quite honestly, was a bit worried that I'd expect too much and be let down. Instead, I was *COMPLETELY* blown away by my experience at Alinea and would have to whole heartedly agree that it's the best restaurant I've been to in the U.S. (sorry, French Laundry). What's even more remarkable is that Alinea has only been around for 5 years, during part of which Chef Grant Achatz had battled tongue cancer.Words can not adequately describe the phenomenal meal I had at Alinea. It is a true experience in all forms - the surprise of hidden sliding doors, interacting with the unique presentations of each dish, anticipating what the next extraordinary course would bring, and most importantly, having my taste buds delighted and pushed to the limit with innovative, incredible food. You really do just have to experience it for yourself.The food at Alinea is progressive, ambitious, artistic, and totally original. It was creative without being gimmicky. Chef Achatz and his team take modern American cuisine to a whole new level with their inventive genius.The service was impeccable. Every need was anticipated before we had to ask for anything. The staff was professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable. \u00a0I learned so much about the food and wine. [BTW, I highly recommend the reserve wine pairing. The wine beautifully complemented the food - an impressive feat with ~20 courses!]The only thing I didn't love about my experience at Alinea was the ambience. The dining room (there are 3) is a small, rectangular room with modern, minimalist d\u00e9cor in cool grey, beige, and black tones. It felt impersonal and lacked warmth. It's a good thing that the food was so mesmerizing; else it'd be awkward to be in such a sparse room where you are so acutely aware of your neighbors. But maybe that was intentional, and they want you to just focus on the food.A few of my favorite courses...ENGLISH PEA - unlike anything I've ever eaten before! Peas were mixed with frozen burrata cheese and dusted with Iberico ham powder. It was ice cold yet creamy, salty, sweet, and meaty all at once. The sherry \"bubbles\" and melon would also transform each bite by accentuating different flavors. TOMATOES - this dish transported me to another place. I was initially confused and intrigued when they put pillows on top of the table. Then I started to smell the fresh, grassy aroma emitted by the pillows. Once the plate of heirloom tomatoes was set on the pillows, more of the aroma was emitted as the pillows deflated...it was like eating ripe tomatoes straight from the garden! If summer had a taste, this would be it. PORK BELLY- this pork belly was ABSOLUTELY ORGASMIC! It had been slowly simmered in coconut milk and just melted in my mouth. I wanted more! HOT POTATO - great things really do come in small packages. A metal pick slides down to drop a piece of butter, hot potato, and black truffle into the tiny wax bowl filled with cold potato soup. Let me say that again...Truffles. Potatoes. Butter. Totally my kind of comfort food! This was so delicious, it took all my restraint to keep myself from licking the bowl clean. EARL GREY - I was ready to dislike this dessert because I detest early grey tea, but this was surprisingly my favorite dessert of the evening. It was a moist and crumbly early grey cake served with pine nut custard, lemon curd, and rose gel\u00e9e. The flavors were so well balanced - buttery, sweet, tart, and with just a hint of bitterness from the earl grey. The caramelized white chocolate noodle also added a playful yet tasty touch. CHOCOLATE - The ultimate demonstration of fantasy and wonder at Alinea. \u00a0You will have to see this for yourself...a tableside presentation like no other! After our 4 hour meal, I felt inspired and completely enchanted. Alinea made me fall in love with food all over again. \u00a0I've had many great meals, but few have left me feeling so awestruck.

When I went to Alinea, I had been traveling all over the country due to my job and was eating out almost every day. I enjoy good food, but at some point I was starting to experience restaurant fatigue at every \"fancy or great\" place I was going to. (Great, the steak tasted amazing, the fish was awesome, so on and so forth, but I felt like I'd seen the same \"twists\" at other restaurants). Alinea was able to take my taste buds on a REAL adventure. It was like if you were straight edge and then all of a sudden you took acid. My world exploded. The food. As others have mentioned, this is molecular gastronomy... which means most of the time you have no idea what you are eating. It's abstract art in edible form. But whatever comes out is whimsical and different from what you've experienced before.We went for the 24 course meal. Should have heeded the warning to NOT get the wine flight. They don't skimp on refilling your glass. We were so full and uncoordinated I felt like someone needed to carry me out of the restaurant. The service: impeccable. Our sommelier and waiter were charming and extraordinarily patient with us, considering we were the last ones to leave the restaurant and also were generally making asses out of ourselves. (See above statement about NOT GETTING THE WINE FLIGHT to make sure you do not end up us.) \u00a0Playing Lady Gaga loudly over your iPhone for 30 seconds and asking what wine goes best with Filet-O-Fish is probably something that would get you kicked out of an establishment like this, yet somehow these folks managed to remain friendly and down-to-earth-best-Midwest-nice-without-being-\u00adoverbearing. Also, who would have thought it, but this is fine dining at its most accommodating:1. One of our party is vegan, and the kitchen made all 24 of his courses vegan friendly. I was extremely impressed with the results. \u00a0For example, when the rest of our group got the infamous \"bacon on a swing\" dish, our veg friend got a dish that looked exactly like it. It was an apple slice, carved to look like a piece of bacon. Yes, I am easily amused.2. If Grant Achatz is there, he will sign your menu. (Squeal now, foodies!) And even if he isn't, apparently you can ask for him to sign it anyways and then Alinea will mail it to you. Don't say I didn't warn you: anything you eat for weeks after going to Alinea is just going to taste like unflavored oatmeal.", "Date": "2011-03-16", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Andrew F.", "ReviewID": "-Ki9dxI2dKR57bucOxpaZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[For the full review with pictures, see the link to my blog on my profile.]I thought my plan was foolproof: two months to the calender day as soon as 11am Eastern Time struck, I would call Alinea and presumably have no problem securing a reservation. Well, I was under a misapprehension. It ultimately took 3-5 phone calls per minute for 95 minutes before I finally made it through to a reservationist. I hated the restaurant before I had even crossed the border into Illinois.During my final class of the semester, when the subject of Chicago restaurants surfaced, one of my stats professors mentioned that Alinea delivered the best meal of his life. I found myself struggling to agree with him. It's not the best meal I've had, I said, nor is it the tastiest food I've ever had. But it doesn't need to be because it's the most fun I've ever had in a restaurant tout court.Alinea's impishness is on display from the moment one is seated, as the table's centerpiece is a large block of ice gravid with beet-hibiscus-black licorice juice that becomes a palate cleanser following an aggressively seasoned pur\u00e9e of scallops--intended to mirror tofu, except with flavor, of course--sitting in, inter alia, dashi. With one playful dish after another, the occasional pratfall is bound to occur. And it did, several times. Nothing fell flatter than a utensil-free course of Mangalitsa ham, squid tentacle, orange and fennel, which tasted as if the kitchen had discovered a way to transmogrify orange into a dog's chew toy, making for one of the more unpleasant adventures of the evening. And then there was the edible helium-filled green apple taffy balloon. The balloon is temperature sensitive, and due to the moderate humidity that day, on first delivery one of the balloons shriveled into an unattractive mass, at which point a collective dejection cascaded across the dining room; based on the runner's reaction and how quickly he absconded back to the kitchen, you would have thought he arrived with his pants down. Those lapses can be easily overlooked given the deep-water greatness of several items. After a few introductory courses that amount to throat-clearing exercises, the kitchen demonstrated its ability to walk on water with four courses of outright genius that detonate on your palate unlike anything you've experienced before. It started with a mouthful of spring: four torrid stones holding first of the season morels coated in the feathery baste of beurre mont\u00e9, asparagus, maitakes, mushroom pur\u00e9e, fried mizuna, and a sixty-three degree quail egg.Next, we'd be treated to an Achatz original: hot potato-cold potato, which leaves your brain trying to conduct an expeditious inventory of details--hot, black truffle-topped Yukon gold potato (check!), cold, velvety potato soup (check!)--as it reconciles two seemingly incongruous sensations.Moving on to what would constitute the main course, first a mirror with sixty ingredients was placed in the middle of the table, soon followed by a plate with three immaculately prepared cuts of lamb: the shank, the saddle and the loin. This almost seemed like the kitchen's way of saying, \"Hey, just in case you thought all we do is play around with gels, hydrocolloids and unconventional plating techniques, check this s*** out.\"Spacing out the classics, then came the black truffle explosion, Achatz's successful effort that lasers in on the flavor of black truffle. As if it had been read a sob story, the raviolo gushed forth its black truffle goodness. And despite instructions to seal one's lips tightly, I managed to spray truffle stock half-way across the table. Overseeing this playground was our server Kevin, a hirsute redhead. I had read that service could be on the cold and condescending side, but that certainly wasn't our experience, for everyone who made a pit stop at our table was delightful and most courteous. My one gripe is that while a meal at Alinea will leave one giddy, there's also fatigue that comes with two-and-a-half hours of instructions that precede each course--don't grab the burning end of the cinnamon stick, don't bite down on the metal ball, please don't wait too long to enjoy this dish as it is time sensitive and on it goes--such that there are points where one wonders, \"Is this a restaurant, or am I in the principal's office?\" One final point: it seemed to me that tables were a bit too close to one another. This wouldn't be such a problem if menu length varied by table, as it did several years ago (when the restaurant offered a 26-course option). However, since every table now experiences the same sequence of courses, there's a reasonably high probability that many of the surprises can be sullied if you find yourself gazing in any direction for too long. Notwithstanding these minor quibbles, the food is stunning.

That's not to say I didn't appreciate each course. The flow of the meal was perfectly paced. The starting courses revolved around lighter, cleaner flavors and slowly progressed into rich and heavy offerings before transitioning into the dessert portions. Over the course of the 3 \u00a01/2 hour meal, the staff starts to feel like old friends (especially if you've had some wine). Which brings me to another point - they specialize in wine pairings and offer a small selection of beer only. So you won't be able to booze it up while you eat :)Overall, I feel that this was indeed a special once-in-a-lifetime type of meal. It did not change my life, nor did it make me feel like I ascended to some higher state of consciousness.

Everything about it from walking into an unmarked door to the service to the food was all impeccable. This is a food experience unlike anything I have ever tried. Most of the dishes were wonderful and complex. Not everything worked and tasted great. But you sort of understand what they were trying to accomplish even if the result wasn't perfected.Each dish was served on some gadget out of Alton Brown's kitchen. They had pins, knifes, wires, pillows, and all types of strange contraptions.One memorable dish was the \"Hot Potato\", cold potato soup, black truffle, butter. The almost overpowering truffle in this cold soup really blended so well with the potato. It brought the main ingredients to the forefront and I had wished more of the touring menu was like this.The Rhubarb; ginger, basil course was really unexpected. It was a candy ball containing sweet and refreshing rhubarb and basil juice. The ball created an intense flavor explosion in your mouth.Some dishes that I didn't think work as well was the Wagyu Beef. This was brought out frozen and pinned to a stand to let defrost over several courses. The Wagyu was sliced so thinly for it to defrost properly; it was difficult to taste the wonderful fatty meat.The Dry shot, pineapple, rum, cilantro was served in powdered form in a paper envelope and you're supposed to empty the packet in your mouth. It created a pina colada shot but the powders didn't mix well so you are left with a dry clump. It was definitely creative but not so tasty.Maybe it was because we did the five hour 25 course touring menu and it was around 1 o'clock in the morning at that point. But when we got to the desserts they did not live up to the other courses.This was really a once in a lifetime experience for me.

lactose intolerant. \u00a0I let them know this, of course. \u00a0When we arrived on time for our reservation, we were asked to wait 10 minutes before our table would be ready. \u00a0When it was, they showed us to a table upstairs and then re-confirmed our food limitations (my lactose intolerance). \u00a0Generally I would say that the presentation of the food was fantastic. \u00a0It was whimsical, unique and intriguing. \u00a0My particular favorites were the course that was smoking the entire duration it was on the table, and the helium balloon that was eatable. \u00a0However, most of the courses were either \"gels\" or \"foams\", which were interesting, but didn't actually taste very good. \u00a0There is only so much gel or foam I can eat in one setting, and we had MANY courses to go through. \u00a0Several times we asked the waitstaff what was in one of the courses (usually because it looked like it had cream in it, but sometimes just because we were curious), and we were very disappointed to hear that \"they preferred not to tell us\". \u00a0Apparently it is part of the \"experience\" to have you wonder what you are eating without actually knowing. \u00a0I don't mind that this is their preference, but if I'm physically asking the question, I do not want to be told that they won't give me the answer. \u00a0It just seemed that Alinea has too big of an ego on that point. \u00a0I get that 3 Michelin stars is a big deal, but I would still appreciate it if you would reasonably answer my questions. \u00a0I think the thing that really disappointed me the most was the last course. \u00a0A chef/artist came over to our table and basically drew on it with various dessert ingredients. \u00a0At least he did tell us what they were as he put them on the table. \u00a0But of course, the last ingredient that he put \u00a0ON TOP OF EVERYTHING was MILK. \u00a0And then he walked away. \u00a0I managed to find a couple pieces of food that missed the milk covering and I ate those two bites, but I really couldn't eat anything else on the table. \u00a0When the server came over to ask me why I wasn't eating much, I said that I was trying to eat the parts I could. \u00a0She just walked away, without acknowledging the fact that they had pre-confirmed my food restriction twice, and then proceeded to do absolutely nothing to account for it. \u00a0I am glad that I was able

Nothing to suggest to you that you are at the site of the number one restaurant in North America.Once you pull open the plain doors of 1723 N. Halsted, you walk into a dark hallway with cascading walls and soothing red light. The hallway abruptly halts to a dead end and right before your mind tells you that you did something wrong, an automatic sliding, stainless-steel door (I swear they imported it from the Starship Enterprise) opens to your left and you are immediately greeted by a staff member who soothingly coos,\"Welcome to Alinea.\"My excitement for this restaurant runs deep.

I kept thinking to myself, \"It's okay if it disappoints a little, my expectations are just too lofty.\"I'll spare you the details of the dishes. We had 18 courses with wine pairings so it'd take way too many words. The menu changes regularly too so my banter about it would just be outdated within a few months.

Chef Achatz' command of flavor, texture, sight, and surprise is unsurpassed and the many articles I've read comparing a dinner at Alinea to a performance at the theater are not exaggerated. The final dessert course is something a lot of people often write about.

With my reservation set for a month in advance, I eagerly anticipated the discoveries of a lifetime on my dinner plate. Now that I've been through the tour at Alinea, I can truly say that food is more than just nourishment. It's a way of life that evokes feeling and emotion; to be more specific, true happiness!The experience began as I walked thru the large unmarked wood doors. A long hallway awaited me and mysteriously directed me to the sliding doors of the restaurant. The decor was sleek and very clean. I was greeted by the host and brought up the stairs to a nice corner table where the food experience of a lifetime was to occur. 26 courses and 4 hours later, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Some favorites of mine included a cauliflower puree dish, pumpkin and gruyere cheese custard served a bed of smoke, trout roe with tropical flavors, and a wagyu beef and mushroom dish with a maple infused sherry vinegar.

I felt like I was walking in a shrinking hallway, a la Willy Wonka. The gentleman that greeted us at the front door was kinda rude. I typically do not put reservations under my last name because it is difficult to spell and a tad long. Usually I use my partners last name. So when he asked for the name on the reservation, I automatically gave my partners. No. Try my last name. No. Some confusion ensued. The reservation was under my name but it took about 5 minutes for him to find it and this guy kept insisting they did not have our reservation. This was my birthday and the restaurant is a special treat so I was starting to panic a bit. Fine, things happen, but I felt like he acted like this was my fault and he was rude and snobby about it and he did not apologize. Bad start. Dining room service was nice. Several servers came by our table throughout the night and they were all professional with a bit of humor thrown in. Our waitress was a little soft spoken but did not mind answering any questions or repeating herself when asked. I liked that she not only listed the ingredients in the dishes but she also explained how to eat the courses that were served in nontraditional manners. Decor was very minimal but pretty. I wish they played music in the dining room. Awkward silence. I really don't want to hear the conversation from the table across the room. Also, the dining room was freezing. Our waitress said they were having problems with the heater and brought me a pashmina. The girl at the table across also requested one so I know it wasn't just me. Seriously, my toes were numb. Not cool when we are shelling out around $300 per person. The food was interesting, theatrical, creative beyond creative. The presentations were some of the most creative I have ever seen. Taste wise though, most were just OK. Several dishes, 3 or 4, were overly salty. I like salt but it should enhance the flavor of food not BE the flavor. Very few dishes made me say, 'Wow. This tastes amazing.' Most were just good. Not great. For my taste, there were way to many dessert courses. Four or five I think. The grand finale dessert literally covered the entire table and I was already so done with sweet flavors. I didn't even really want to eat it, even though it was the best one. I kinda felt sick by that point! The sommelier asked what we were going to drink. I did not want to do the tasting and he suggested I go with a glass of champagne. He was pleasant and not pushy about the wine tasting. I was a little surprised when the bill arrived. I believe the most expensive glass of champagne on the menu was $18 but somehow we were charged $25 per glass. Hmmm. Alinea is definitely a unique dining experience. You will see and experience food here in a way that is unlike any other restaurant. I had fun and Alinea made this a memorable birthday. (I do not think I would have enjoyed it if we did not have a $500 gift card!) Overall, I just found the flavors to be lacking and have no desire to return. While I appreciate pretty and creative presentations, to me the taste of the food is what makes a great dish.

I have to be honest and say that I had low expectations with this type of cuisine since, it's kinda 'freaky' and I thought it was just some commercial invention intended to suck us dry. But I gave Alinea a try after the eventful events I read about Grant Achatz and because this is the top rated Chicago restaurant in Yelp.And boy I was blown away.As expected, there are a lot of unique stuff about the food here that you probably haven't tasted before, unless you've done molecular gastronomy before. All the dishes deliver one way or the other and they were surprisingly very flavorful and on the heavier side, which is fortunately very much to my preference.My favorite would probably be the cauliflower dish. They pureed & cubed it and coated it with 5 different things. I can't remember them now but bacon was one of them.The pork belly with cooked in coconut milk was fantastic too. It wasn't too fanciful and was one of the simpler dish but it was cooked to absolute perfection.One little complain that I concerns the service. Now, the service was very good but I just felt frustrated of the difference in treatment that the other party at the end of the room got. (When I reached the 3rd/4th course, there were only 2 parties in that room). Alinea offers 2 kinds of menu, the tasting (shorter) and the tour (longer); we ordered the tasting and I am 100% sure so did the other party.First, we were not offered a couple of dishes that the other parties were offered. To my anguish, the dish was foei gras and the other one was some candy dessert that I honestly didn't care about. (I'm not a dessert man). When I asked them for an explanation, they gave a very unsatisfactory answer that \"the chef cooked different meals for different tables\" which actually further proved that we were treated differently. Maybe if we had some dishes that the other party did not have, I'd have understand.Secondly, the servant who described their food to them do it in much detail and was definitely someone senior (Had the suit, tie and all that) but the one who described it to us was, how should I say, some random dude. It was not as if there were no other 'senior' waiters available. In fact, as I mentioned, most of them had nothing to do as the restaurants were kinda quiet when we dined.He was also very short in his description and I had to ask him some questions in order to get the full description of the meal. My and my girlfriends are Chinese, and we are young; now I know that there are some stereotypes that may be Asians are cheapskates and young ones wouldn't understand 'complex' food anyway and I can accept that anywhere else but not in a restaurant like Alinea. I DO understand those foods and I expect those guys to explain it fully to me.But after all that, I would still give them 5 stars. Their service was still very good and polite and as hard as it is to accept, I am a supporter of preferential treatment as well. In a business, obviously you'd treat your regular customer differently but damn, it kinda sucked being on the receiving end and this was my first experience.", "Date": "2009-03-27", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Scott L.", "ReviewID": "vRLnP4aSFdl23_051YZzqQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "They say BMW is the ultimate driving experience, well Alinea is the ultimate DINING experience.First of all you do not need a reservation, you need to purchase tickets when they go on sale. \u00a0The ticket price is the price of your meal so the only thing you have to pay for when your dinner is complete are for drinks. \u00a0Tax & gratuity is also included in the ticket price.The wine list is extensive and if you need help deciding on a wine to compliment your dinner, one of the sommelier can assist.Our dinner was in November and the tasting menu was as follows:Macintosh apple ciderButternutOyster LeafSea UrchinLobsterRazor ClamOtoroCornArctic CharHot Potato/Cold PotatoMatsutakeBlack TruffleLambWoodcockGinerCarrotBallonDark ChocolateThis probably does not mean anything to anyone that may read this review. \u00a0In fact it probably isn't very helpful. \u00a0You have to experience Alinea to appreciate what Chef Grant Achatz has put together. \u00a0He is truly a pioneer and leader in molecular gastronomy.Overall Alinea is the ultimate dinning experience and the service is impeccable.", "Date": "2013-01-08", "Author_Location": "Union City, NJ"}, {"Author": "Meaghan F.", "ReviewID": "mIzc61fH3bpNkxDzO7nX0w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Presumably one of the best restaurants in America, I was prepared to be blown away at the cuisine, elegance, presentation and ambiance of Alinea.

\u00a0Whaaaaa?!!!This is what they like to call \"hands-free\" dining. \u00a0It's one little bite on a skewer that you simply remove with your mouth. \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0Fun. \u00a0Less important were the ingredients: \u00a0Mackerel, mango, bergamot flower and who knows what else.Then a little mushroom garden with a cream infused with pine (yes, pine... as in 'cone') and a bunch of other interesting ingredients. \u00a0I think they were going for a forest-in-your-mouth sensation. \u00a0Success.Oh! \u00a0And then there was \"hot potato, cold potato\". \u00a0A warm, creamy potato soup with a mini 'cold potato' on which a slice of black truffle rested. \u00a0There was also a little cube of butter and parm on the mini skewer which melted into the soup upon removing the skewer from its resting place. \u00a0All carefully dropped into the soup which was then gulped from the little bowl. \u00a0This one was fun too.Here's the fanciest little lamb dish you'll ever see. \u00a0I can't tell you all of the components but I can tell you that this was one to merit the chair dance. \u00a0Wonderful!A favorite at the table (and amongst Achatz followers) was the \"Truffle Explosion\". \u00a0A one bite raviolo filled with juicy truffle heaven. \u00a0It rested on a spoon that sat in a bowl that had no bottom. \u00a0Yes, a bowl built only to hold a spoon. \u00a0The garnish is a tiny romaine leaf, black truffle and shaved parm. \u00a0Ridiculously delicious.Here's a whacky one. \u00a0First, remove the glass plate containing a bunch of little garnishes like blackberry, fermented garlic and olives from its base.Then construct a devise with the tools provided on which to hang the pasta that was somehow snuck to your table in the form of a second center piece.Fill the pasta with decadent braised short ribs and strange garnishes of your choosing before wrapping it up and eating it like a taco. \u00a0See, I told you it was whacky.You can barely see the little octopus tentacle resting next to a smooth, set eggplant puree with coriander and more. \u00a0Take the bite then wash it down with the frothiness in the bowl.This was the intermezzo to clear the palatte. \u00a0Coconut snow with yuzu. \u00a0Just don't lick it directly from the frozen metal or you'll end up like Ralphy from \"A Christmas Story\". \u00a0Ouch.I loved this course, too! \u00a0All kinds of crazy stuff that a normal person would never pair. \u00a0There were squares of peach puree, basil, balsamic, jasmine, mozzarella, creme fraiche! \u00a0I was like a kid in a candy store...

But to be perfectly honest, it could have been better, and this is why we have four stars. I want this to be 4.5, becuase it really was good. But alas, I can't.Of note - crazy serving pieces that almost overshadow the meal at times. We had lavender pillows and a dry ice scent \"vase\" to help complement some courses. Aside from that, a lot of things have already been covered, but my highlights: The hot potato/cold potato is awesome. A great, inventive, very tasty way to start the meal. So rich, and the hot/cold mixes very well. Wild striped bass with a very nice celery flavor was light and also very very good. The black truffle \"explosion\" was also excellent - if you didn't know what truffle tasted like, you do now. The highlight of the meal, Wagyu beef (poached, not grilled) was heavenly. Nothing quite like it, and served with a unique deconstructed A1 sauce that made it all the better. Even the potato accompaniment (coated in salt and vinegar potato chips) added to the fun. Finally, the rhubarb desert was inventively served on a lavender scented pillow. Aside from the crazy serving piece, it was very tasty - I love rhubarb. Now, the missteps - the entire menu was very heavy on salty/savory and sweet flavors. The only tangy/sour taste was in the salt and vinegar chips served with the Wagyu beef (and, almost forgot, the rhubarb course, which was a welcome change towards the end of the meal. The inclusion of some onion in that course made things slightly odd, though...), and only spicy flavors the tiny dot of chili paste served with the pork belly lettuce wrap. So, while what we got was very good, I feel like the palette could have been more rounded. I was starting to get tired of all the salt by the end of the meal - some diners were a little disgusted by it. Some of the courses also pushed the bounds of how salty you'd want something to be...our blood pressure was probably a bit high by the end of the meal. Remember, I still said it was excellent. If there had been one of those moments where, in the words of a fellow diner, my whole mouth was singing, I could give it 5 stars. But it never came. Service was excellent, sommelier either extraordinarily knowledgeable, very well rehearsed, or an unbelievable BSer (all of which earn him equal points from me). Aside from lots of prattling on about grape varietals and whatnot, the service almost managed to be unpretentious, hard to do in this setting. Some jokes, etc. The one thing I noticed, and I'm not sure why this matters, was that the women in our party were usually not served first. It seems the polite thing to do at a formal dinner where you're paying an egregious amount of money. I guess after Tru (where this was the case) I expect high manners to be on display. We were out for my aunt's birthday...and guess who got their champagne cocktail spilled on them by a waitress. They offered to pick up the dry cleaning tab, but some of us felt they should have offered to reduce the check by some amount as well/instead. They were quick to replace her chair, etc. The waitress was absolutely mortified, so it wasn't that they weren't apologetic. I cannot help but compare this to Tru, my high water mark for Chicago dining. And when it all comes down to it, while these were very different kinds of meals, I cannot help but say I would rather have eaten at Tru for less money. I need to go back to Tru and see if it's as good as I remember. One last thing - the bacon course featured very crispy bacon. I cannot help but think that had it been a little chewier, and perhaps a little fresher from the pan (it had grown a tad cold) my review might be better?

Alinea was the most amazing dining experience. \u00a0The amazing experience began the moment we walked up to the restaurant. \u00a0We were greeted by name and was seated at a large black table with plenty of leg and arm room. \u00a0We had two servers to wait on us. \u00a0The restaurant is divided into sections with around six tables in each section. \u00a0It appeared like each section had two main servers. \u00a0In other words, you will be well taken care of. They will provide you will just about anything you may need, including aspirin. They pulled the chair out everytime we went to the bathroom and was ready to seat us as we walked to the table from the bathroom. I tried one time to get up without their help. I think it is impossible. \u00a0 The food was the most amazing food I had ever put into my mouth. \u00a0We got the 28-course dinner that took us around 6 hours to eat. \u00a0Oh my goodness, that was mind blowing. \u00a0I don't want to tell you all the courses, because that may destroy the experience that you could have on your visit. \u00a0I will tell you that Alinea does not serve a specific kind of food. \u00a0I was asked by friends and family, \"What kind of food does Alinea serve?\" \u00a0Well, Alinea isn't American, French, Indian, Mexican or any other nationality of food. \u00a0It is just Alinean food. \u00a0Every dish uses texture, smell, taste and sight to explode your mind with pleasure. The dessert was even more special. Chef Grant and an assistant personal made the dessert right there at our table.

A recently crowned Michelin 3 star establishment, Alinea represented the confluence of dinner theatre, flawless service execution, and of course, epicurean enlightenment.There wasn't a course that wasn't an epiphany which was impressive considering the 18+ courses on the menu. Progressive techniques, dubbed \"molecular gastronomy\" a term to sciencese and lacking emotion for me, were omnipresent and used with astonishing creativity and finesse.A quick note on menu navigation, there is significance to the unique layout of the menu: larger bubbles mean larger portions; darker bubbles signify more intensely flavored dishes; and as the bubbles move from left to right, they move from savory to sweet.Highlights for me included:The Black Truffle Explosion, which might be Chef Achatz's signature dish. Instructed by the server to consume in one bite, the shell breaks and the intense, earthy truffle flavor floods the sensesEscoffier course of Canard a la Cussy complete with period glassware and flatware was like being transported back in time and makes me even more anxious for Next to openThe smoldering stick the venison course was presented on as well as the earl grey pillows were unexpected and impressive sensory touchesLast by certainly not least, Chef Achatz prepared our final course on our table which will forever be seared into my memory. Seeing him demonstrate his craft that close was more celebrity awe-educing than seeing stars when I lived in LA.Service was a perfectly choreographed affair.

It was lamb and it was pretty cold and chewy. I expected it to be hot and melt in your mouth tender, but it seemed like it was sitting out awhile. The venison in the eucalyptus was also not perfect. The venison was pretty overcooked. From pictures I saw, it looked to be cooked medium rare, but mine was rather tough and more cooked medium-well. That being said, they were still pretty great. The service was also spot on and I liked the beer progression.So is it worth it? I think it is absolutely worth it.

When they say 'no course is the same' they really do mean it. The beginning of the night started with the waiter asking me of my likes, dislikes, food allergies, and whatever else I would prefer.

We had poured over pictures of his \"coffeetable\" cookbook (bible more like! and really, not a cookbook for home chefs... like who has liquid nitrogen at home?) and were really psyched about coming here.It was well worth the travel and wait.I think the thing that really sold us was Chef Achatz's versatility. I mean, really, we expected all this crazy stuff coming (hot potato/cold potato, that truffle in a ravioli... OMG! so good) out of the kitchen but then he all the sudden surprises us with a delicious squab/foie gras on puff pastry dish that certainly displays pure, traditional French technique. My hubby and I have that dish totally ingrained in our memory.The way that this restaurant differs from some of the other molecular gastronomy places is the balance of techniques. You need a balance of the old and the new - otherwise it's just some gimmicky thing that will be passe with differing food trends (like foam). The chef definitely uses his art judiciously to enhance his raw materials - not to overwhelm them.Finally, the service. Okay, I was a little perturbed that my flash went off a couple times by accident and the camera nazi quickly reminded me that we weren't allowed to use flash (like instanteously). However, despite all of this, the service was quiet, attentive and professional. Our server was a little stoic but definitely acted like he knew what we were eating. When my husband got a little dribble on his shirt, the server rapidly and discreetly handed him a small packet of Shout wipes to help get out the stain. Really great service!The actual icing on the cake was when Chef Achatz came out himself and served the final dessert course. Of course, he didn't talk much other than to explain the dish. He looked kind of gaunt and tired which is probably in light of his medical condition.

This is what we really liked about MOTO- the story behind the dishes was almost as interesting as eating it. The wine descriptions were much better. Food: Some hits, some misses. Overall, the food was good - but much more uninspired than MOTO. It felt like they were using a lot of the same themes (I counted 3 plays on hot and cold). There were two \"wow\" dishes- but I expected more in the 12 courses. I love the experimental food- but this just didn't live up to the hype. Presentation: Beautiful. Even as an industrial designer I was even a bit wowed by the use unique serving pieces. Wine: Absolutely incredible. This was the savior for me- the wine pairing and choices were amazing.

Yes and more. Was it worth every penny? Hell yes! Is it a life changing food experience? Yes! Will I be coming back? You bet! Soon? Probably not, it definitely broke the bank and I'd also like to see a different menu.Truly 5-star experience. I was able to snag a 2-top ticket from their new ticketing system, which isn't hard to obtain as long as you follow them on Facebook or twitter and you check fairly regularly.The meal at the end of the day ran me nearly $1000, which I will say without hesitation was the best $1000 I've ever spent. Everything from the food, wine pairing, service (sort of), atmosphere, was everything you paid for and more. They only have a prix-fixe menu of 15-17 items, mostly all of them were excellent. They all emphasized the pure flavors of the ingredients such as the corn \u00a0as well as the tomato \u00a0(both fantastic and one our favorites). Other courses emphasized the subtleties and complementary flavors such as the chanterelle (probably our favorite of the evening). Other items were shock and awe like the lamb with 52 different complementary ingredients, which was fun and interactive (good but by far not the best dish) and the apple balloon with edible string (by far the most fun dish). Other courses emphasized a whole new experience, like the black truffle explosion and the white chocolate dessert made table-side by the chef. Even after 2-plus weeks after eating there, there were a lot of items that I still remember every aspect, this was truly a life-changing meal. Other aspects of the restaurant like the decor itself was nice and dimly lit. The service overall was flawless, but some of the staff was not very friendly and a little stuck-up. Our main server however was fairly interactive and friendly. The kitchen tour was amazing as well, spotless and got a chance to do one of our courses prepared on the spot. Though we did not get to meet Chef Achatz, his current chef there was friendly, articulate, and still producing magnificent food. I would certainly like to see him open his own restaurant in the future. If you made it this far in my review and probably others, just do yourself a favor and just grab a ticket and a date and eat here. You won't regret it.**One additional note here** After eating at Charlie Trotter's about a month before and paying nearly $500 per person with wine.

Personally, five star at Yelp means perfection in taste, execution, and experience. Alinea lives and breathes every single quality that I just mentioned. It pretty much changes the way I see fine dining and food in general.Like many people, I came to Alinea with suspicion. Critics raved about his cuisine but can regular foodies like us relate to it? What makes it worth that hefty price? [Insert more questions here...]I was sick of asking and when I found out that my foodie friends were coming to visit me, I immediately made a reservation, noting to the friendly staff that one of us is a vegetarian and some other minor requests. We eventually scored a table on a Saturday night at 6pm.We were promptly greeted with my own name (how do they know it's me?) and seated. We got a sense that the atmosphere was a little stiff at first but as the night progresses and they get to know us better, we started joking and having a little fun while remaining professional at the same time. I won't go to too much detail as I want you to experience it yourself but all I can say is, the staff paid so much attention to little details to ensure that we have an amazing dining experience. We were even joking that they would have a pair of Alinea branded slippers if we ever requested for one. =)Foodwise, we were there before they consolidated two menus into one. So, we had the privilege of having the 28-course dinner. The first course came and it was English peas. Not sure about you but I recalled the horrid of eating boiled peas as a child. I took a first bite and it was bursting with flavors. The dish plays not just with your taste buds but also the texture. I've never thought peas could be prepared like this! Course after course, chef Grant and his team turned simple and exotic ingredients into masterpieces that defies expectations in many ways. I actually lost count of the course number but I could care less. I just wanted the courses to keep coming. =) In an interview, I remembered Grant Achatz said that a dinner at Alinea is like a great theatre performance. I never understood it until that night. The highlight of the night was none other than the last chocolate course, prepared tableside for your viewing pleasure. Trust me, you don't want to miss that. =)We finally left after 6 hours at midnight. Not that I am complaining but honestly, that is the one of the best six hours in my life. I did not want to leave. It made such an impact that everything else after that night tasted bland, even at another top fine dining restaurant that we went the evening after. Instead of talking about the dinner, we were reminiscing and kept comparing it to Alinea. Go figure.We came back that night with a sigh of accomplishment and disbelieve. We just won't see food the same way again and we have Alinea to be thankful for. It's truly the best restaurant in North America.

This was my first experience of eating at a molecular gastronomy restaurant so I was very interested to see how the food was prepared and how it tasted and none of it is what I expected.You might as well throw out every idea of a normal idea of going to a restaurant. It's location, near the Steppenwolf theatre is in a nice area of the city, it's formal attire, and of course, the only shirt I brought with me to Chicago doesn't close at the neck, but as it's a fancy shirt I get away with the tie and unbuttoned neckline.All staff are finely dressed and we were seated at a black wooden table with very comfy upholstered chairs. There is a pumpkin in the middle of the table. We were told we weren't getting a menu until after the meal. So there was no \"I'll have the fish\" you don't order here, you get what your given. After a quick check that none of us have any allergies the meal arrives in 3 hours (yes 3 hours!) worth of molecular constructed courses. After drinks orders we are told that the first course is already in front of us, the waiter lifts up the pumpkin and underneath is our first course, an amuse bouche of pumpkin, curry sage and coconut. After this we get a wooden block full of seaweed with 4 sea shell on top all with different things. We are told the recommended order in which to eat them and also that all should be taken in one bite. Over the course of the next 3 hours many different dishes in different formats arrive, so much that I can't in my semi jet-lagged state can hardly keep up with (and this review would go on forever!!). At one point a glass chemical pot is placed in the middle of the table and a Bunsen burner placed underneath, we are told by the waiter he's not allowed say anymore. The water at the bottle of the jar is boiled and goes up a tube to the top of the jar which has a a variety of vegetables. The water suddenly drops down to the bottom jar and this is repeated while we dine on other courses. Eventually we are given a tofu scallop and the waiter takes out the bottom jar and pours it on the tofu, this is the broth for the dish.There is a \"hands free\" dish which is set on the top of an antenna you suck off, some fried pigeon on the bottom of a branch with the leaves a little burnt to give an Autumn aroma, red cabbage leaves are left sitting in the middle of the table, very unappetising looking, as the waiter says \"looks like a sliced section of a brain.\" This eventually turns out to be the cabbage leaf in which other components are wrapped in. A mushroom dish was brought out on a pillow which had a scent of pine to give the feel of being in the woods. One dish came on a assortment of forks and spoons designed into the shape of a leaf on the table, and you ate one fork/spoon at the time. One you suck out of a test-tube which surprises us all by bolting into our mouths.The finale though, was something else. We were given yuzu in a metal cone the texture of snow to clean our palettes. A dish of squares on a plate was the first dessert course. We are encouraged the mix and match the squares. One square is pear, another balsamic vinegar, I think there was an olive in there somewhere. Then the waiters come out and put a tablecloth down. A jar with liquid nitrogen is brought our and a chocolate dome and 3 dishes of sauces. Two of the chefs come out and start saucing the tablecloth. The liquid nitrogen is poured into the chocolate domes and the chefs smash the domes in the middle of the table. Inside there's butternut squash, pumpkin, cotton candy and god knows what else. You mix with the sauces.The taste of the food in general was exquisite, some better than others. Some to me just tasted chemically. Others like the pigeon and the dessert, were astounding. And it's not just about the food at Alinea. It's a show, it's a performance with food as the main character. This is cuisine on the edge.

Although I am certified broke now, the whole trip was worth every penny! This is a highly sought after restaurant. It has opened since 2005 and is still going strong. So don't you dare to call it a hype! I had my wonderful experience on this past Saturday. The restaurant is spaced out in different pods. We were seated in one of their pods upstairs. Table was not set until my party sat down. The staff set it in front of us and jokingly explained that they had shrunk the table cloth to a small pillow, hence, no table cloth. An unconventional start. I didn't go for the wine pairings because I am no wine expert. I 'd rather save my taste buds for the delicate dishes. Food was then served promptly after he explained how it worked. There was no music on the background. I could actually hear other patrons' conversations and their ooooh's and ahhhh's. It could easily be me having a dinner party in my imaginary designer dining room. Everybody looked relaxed and was having fun. That's how I felt. It's a casual and cozy environment. I did not get pretentious from Alinea, given that this is a michellin 3 star restaurant. I never feel rushed. They didn't give me dirty looks for taking too many pictures. They even gave me a heads up before the balloon came out because it didn't do well in room temperature, so I could start snapping pictures as soon as my balloon was escorted out.Not only did the food look super appetizing (with the help of vibrant colors and intriguing plating), it tasted phenomenal too! Portion was small but definitely a party in every bite! As I understood, the whole meal was divided into 3 series, tastes from the ocean, the earth and then dessert. And they were not kidding, each bite captured the flavors very well. From the taste to plating, every detail was well designed and executed. Each bite was precious and worked harmoniously with each other. One of my highlights was the sighting of Chef Achatz! He would go to most tables to create the final course himself and smashed those eggs. It was a pleasure to see him popping up here and there throughout the night. When he came to my table and worked his magic, it was a show and he knew it. He gave a performance without being over-the-top. He was different from other celebrity chefs. Don't expect him to make small talks. He explained the course matter-of-factly. As soon as it was done, he would leave. Not aloof (in my opinion), but kept it professional.One thing is very different from other restaurants was that staffs never introduced themselves and they constantly changed. Among 15 courses, I think I had at least 7 different staffs served at our table, and I only knew one of their names (slipped out accidentally). They were very attentive but not pushy, and they all had similar sense of humor. They kept making witty dry comments. I wonder if they had a script or guidelines for what they may or may not say. All in all, I had a great time. It is an experience that evokes all of your senses. I will definitely go back!Trivia: I had the pleasure to tour the kitchen at the end of dinner. It's a medium sized kitchen with no actual fire going on. Helium tank fills up balloon regularly. They clean the kitchen 4 times a day. It did look spotless to me. The expediter was only 21-year-old and great at what he's doing. All servers run up and down the service stairs like hundred times a day. There are 20 tables in total and filled up every night.

I know I want to go back, but that's more out of curiousity than because I really liked their food.Don't get me wrong, there were some fantastic dishes to be had at Alinea. In particular we really liked the Sour Cream, Melon, Finger Limes, Pineapple and Strawberries. But there were also some real duds.Duds. There's an interesting word. When I use it to describe Alinea's food, it's not because the food lacked flavor. On the contrary, I'd say that certain dishes contained too much flavor. Or at least too much of one flavor that the dish seemed imbalanced and over powered by items that were supposed to play a supporting role. One of the first dishes that springs to mind is the Broccoli Stem. This was a disappointing dish because I had been looking forward to it after reading about it online. The grapefruit in this dish and the steelhead roe just completely masked this poor broccoli to the point that you could have put almost any vegetable in there without making much of a difference.Then there were dishes like the Porcini that tasted like nothing but pureed sunflower seeds. Oddly, since the porcini flavor is similarly earthy and nutty, it was just a muddled mass of goo in my mouth. I think this was the only dish I didn't finish.Other dishes were just disappointing because, as creative as they were, they just actually didn't go far enough. The Beef (flavors of A-1) had all of these little flavors to try with your beef, but they didn't give you enough ink in your well to truly experiment with the canvas they gave you. I actually just rolled mine all up to combine all of the flavors and didn't bother trying to mix-n-match in what appeared to be a futile exercise.I realize that I've focused almost exclusively on the negatives here, but that's because I figured there is enough praise and drooling on the eGullet forums that I should give a counter point.Don't get me wrong, I can certainly understand what people are raving about and I really do think Chef G is an important figure in the American culinary scene. I think his influences will be felt for years to come, especially as he becomes more established and more of a household name among non-foodies.Regardless, even after months of reflecting on our meal, it just doesn't change the fact that we walked away disappointed. Some have been criticized for going without having an open mind or they just don't understand the cuisine or numerous other silly knocks. I can confidently say that I went with an open mind knowing fully what to expect, but the food, or more specifically the flavors, just didn't seem like anyone tasted them before putting it on an antennae and sticking in front of me.This got me thinking about the experience of dining. An interesting thing about dining, is that a single dish isn't going to make or break a meal. The experience as a whole is what people will remember when they decide if they like a restaurant. A particular dish is what people will remember when they decide if they like a particular flavor profile. A great example of this is The French Laundry. Aside from the Oysters & Pearls, I can't say there were a lot of dishes that really stand out in my mind, yet it was one of the best meals I've had in my life. In contrast, I remember quite vividly several dishes from Alinea, both good and bad, yet it was probably our least favorite meal of our entire Chicago trip (Ann Sather being the other).So no, I didn't enjoy our meal there. Yes, I would encourage others to go. Yes, I enjoyed the challenge. And yes, I'm looking forward to returning.

This restaurant is for serious restaurant-lovers and you are going to spend a lot of money there so my suggestion is to dive in to the deep end of the pool and get the wine pairing because it is worth doing at a place like this.Usually when my wife and I go to dinner we choose a cuisine (Asian, Greek, French) or focus on a food (duck, fish, steak) and then select an old favorite restaurant or choose a new place that we have heard of.Alinea chooses to look at food and restaurants differently. Their kitchen does not have traditional stations, there is no line, the food tickets are held in the front and called out by a maestro like figure who orchestrates a team of over 24 cooks.The restaurant like Charlie Trotters, Les Nomades and other boutique restaurants is located a converted brownstone just north of the Steppenwolf Theater on Halsted and is modern with glass staircases, original modern art and has a minimalist but warm feel.Alinea is truly different however in its approach to the food. The menu you will be served is fixed, so aside from any food allergies you won't be choosing anything and the focus of each plate served to you is not a cuisine or a product but a flavor.You then add to the flavor by mixing the main item with side items & sauces which change that base flavor and make your plate different from anyone else who had it before. For example the Ice Fish course had segments of the fish placed along a line of vegetables and sauces including horseradish and other complementary flavors that you mix together in different combinations which creates more unique flavors.In some dishes instead of you changing he flavors they change them around for you by having ingredients mix together like the Apple Cider \"shot\" which came in a glass where the cider was trapped inside a nickel sized ball made of cinnamon flavored skin and was floating in walnut milk. You tipped the shot back and the ball burst in your mouth mixing the cider and walnut milk with the cinnamon. All the dishes were this way often forcing opposites together like sweet and salty, milky and crunchy etc.Overall I give Alinea five stars because it is truly unique and recognized world wide for what it is. However I would say these types of preparations are a bit of a schtick that for some people may get old by the 16th or 20th course.Having said that, this is truly a professional kitchen doing things you can't do at home which is why people should go out. This group of young people are definitely serious and will go on to do great things themselves. Summary: Each plate was an artist's palette that needs you to complete it but if you go there you have to approach it not as going out for a type of food or a single item but that you are going out to experience what a talented group of chefs can do with flavors.", "Date": "2010-10-31", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Chloe F.", "ReviewID": "K2skD33eyfG3HrUkE-aVPw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even with all the hype, it's awesome.

Then the door to the left slid open, which was a really nice touch. Everyone was really friendly and we were seated in the usual fancy restaurant manner with the table being pulled out and all that.We had the smaller menu, which was MORE than enough food. Everything was certainly quite good, it seemed like some of it was more for the sake of presentation than flavor. Every course was served by a different waiter, which was a little distracting, but as a result, the waiters were able to expertly explain what each dish was and how to eat it (and for some of the dishes you really need the explanation!). There were also matching breads for all the salty dishes. The butter-themed dish was my favorite, followed by hot/cold potato. The desserts were all good, but I didn't have much appetite left by then. I suppose if you want to enjoy these, you better skip on some of the breads.The service was amazingly attentive and paid a lot of attention to detail. We just had hot water with our meal, and the waiter made sure to keep pouring in more hot water to maintain the right temperature. The decor was simple, and the tables were spaced far enough apart that you couldn't really hear the other tables. However, that doesn't really mean that the place was quiet, as there is still a low hum.My final verdict is that it's a place you HAVE to try once (if you have the budget) if you're in Chicago, and probably only once. Save it for a nice occasion. It'll totally be worth it.Side note: It was raining cats and dogs that night, so I autopilot locked my keys in the car.

We went through maybe 21 or 22 courses and with each arrival, our table was cleaned, new utensils arrived on a cushion or tiny platter, and we were told a story about each of our wine pairings. Our servers and sommeliers really knew what they were talking about and no one made us feel like we shouldn't be there (which has happened before seeing as we look fairly young). I have never been so spoiled at a restaurant. We also discovered a delicious muscat that we regret not buying then because we haven't been able to find it since. The quality of the food was impressive and each course was so meticulously plated that for the first few courses we were both gingerly stabbing at our plate, trying not to ruin anything. That night was also the second time in my life where my food came with instructions! For example, one of our courses required sliding a slab of meat off a pin and dropping it into a bowl of sauce before mixing it up and eating it. There was also one where you had to drop a ball into a tiny glass and let the liquid react before drinking it. And there was one mini treasure hunt for the pork inside a tall bowl full of pine needles (that one smelled really good and tasted even better). Of course, the nutmeg pillow had to be my favorite looking as it was pretty cool to watch your plate slowly drop to the table as the pillow deflated.If you like experimental dishes, you'll love Alinea.

Then you go to a place like Blackbird, that kind of claims to be that hip, casual thing, but they are so holier-than-thou hipster cool with their service that it was a real turn off for me. It's like they're trying too hard, you know?So not the case with Alinea. Not only is the food super creatively presented, but for all its formality and expense, it's not stuffy or fake-ly cool. It's actually casual, like when they present you with the wrap that you must eat with your hands, or our sommelier that had Carrot Top's hair (seriously, at my husband's old restaurant, they didn't even want him to have his goatee). \u00a0Go for the wine pairing, it's delicious, and it's pretty fun to be buzzed as you're trying out all these crazy presentations.", "Date": "2010-11-06", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Eric W.", "ReviewID": "9-hxC6Qk0yABUC97IGszoQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alinea provides one of the best and most complete all around meals I have ever had. \u00a0I could not recommend this restaurant higher.", "Date": "2013-09-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Carrie W.", "ReviewID": "pVAR6PlvXItF9T5UdBgM6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know what to add to the heaps of praise dumped on this establishment, but I do know that each of the three times I have experienced Grant's wizardry has been one of the peak dining experiences of my life.Simply, it boils down to this.

Love. This.

It's definitely among the most expensive meals you'll have, but it's so worth every penny.I do, however, have 2 main beefs with Alinea:1) Certain dishes get too much play. If you go once this isn't a problem, but become a repeater and you're going to see some things over and over. This is OK, but some of them were mediocre to begin with; bacon just isn't all that great, the transparencies are cute, but not very useful, and the yuba is just not that tasty.2) Every time we go I don't get to meet Grant. Last summer the final dish was a table-side preparation that he was personally performing for every table. We were the last people in the place and he left just before our serving, so we got the second string. This is... annoying; I had specifically stated up front I wanted to meet him because I hadn't on previous visits. I understand that he can't always be at the ready for every request, but it was a little bit of a slap in the face that we were the only people in the place whom he didn't serve for.That said, I still highly recommend you find a way to make a visit. It's an experience you'll never forget. Having eaten at the Fat Duck the week before my last visit I can honestly say Alinea is a much richer experience.A few words of advice, though:-Eat well the day you go. If you starve yourself and then go you'll be miserable by course 13.-Pace yourself. Let them know a few dishes in advance if you need a break. It's a several hour experience, you don't want to rush through it.-Don't get the tasting, get the tour. It's twice the food and price, but the tasting is like getting the Cliffs Notes of the meal.-Get the wine pairing. The sommaliers do an excellent job of finding the perfect pairing, and can work around your personal tastes.

Mind you this was at the beginning of December, my reservation was for February. Having not been home in almost two years, I lured my extremely Asian parents (meaning their idea of a fancy dinner is a meal at Olive Garden, anything beyond that is unnecessary) here on the basis of it being my baby sister's birthday. They began our meal by greeting us and wishing my sister a happy birthday. Although their names escape me now, the waiters we had were all great. I was a little worried at the beginning about the stuffiness, but they warmed up, were funny and definitely added some wittiness to each dish. They also set aside a special dish for the birthday girl, a creative dessert involving the unwrapping of a present and chocolate and warm cream? which she thoroughly enjoyed. The meal was spectacular and even my parents thought so (WINNN!). Everything was clearly incredibly well thought out and without a doubt, an experience unlike any other. \u00a0The highlights of the meal were the Yuba, King Crab, Wild Mushrooms, Hot Potato and Dark Chocolate. The only thing I did not enjoy was the Oyster Leaf, the fishiness of it was really unpleasant although I do understand what they were aiming for.

Of course, Alinea topped that list. Now, we can officially move without regret because we've had the most memorable dinner in our lives that appealed to every sense and surprised us at every stage.Highlights from the approximately 20-course meal:*The grand entrance - Walking over the threshold, we brushed past the spruce trees and faux wind gusts within a narrow hallway to emerge at the host stand/entrance to the kitchen. The host graciously hung up our coats and immediately served us a unique blend of hot cocoa, rich in chocolate with a hint of that woodsy spruce.*More fun than stuffy - With servers who consistently joked and encouraged us to play with our food from the get-go, I appreciated the whimsical nature of the meal. For example, we got to interact with our dishes during the Asian seafood portion of the night by cooking our tender scallop on a hot lava rock, slurping butternut squash soup out of a straw, and munching on a crunchy shrimp head complete with the shell.*Simple and complex at the same time - My favorite course of the whole meal was the tender, juicy duck done four ways with a ginormous platter of unlabeled condiments (ie. pecans, rosemary, mustard) that traditionally go well with duck. The server suggested to combine no more than two condiments at a time and to go with the substances that we did immediately not recognize. *One-bite bursts- The Hot Potato/Cold Potato shot and Black Truffle explosion in a delicate ravioli were bold and melted instantaneously in my mouth. It was like falling in love at first sight but then your supposed soul mate disappears into the night so quickly \u00a0that you don't even get a phone number.*Unexpected, jaw-dropping desserts - When the balloon of green apple taffy came out, I thought I was somehow mistaken for being much younger (expected as an Asian woman). Turns out - it was another dish meant for play. We even got pins to pop the balloon so that we could eat them. But the very final course is what left the most lasting impression: Our server asked for my husband to sit next to me on the bench instead of across from me. Then, a (sous?) chef appeared with a rubber mat that he rolled on to the table, along with bowls of colorful \"paint\" that turned out to be aged cherry vinegar and orange liqueor. Painting in swift motions with the edible liquids, he created a beautiful design across the mat. My husband and I were truly mesmerized. Then, the conclusion to our fairy tale dinner: The artist took what we thought was a brown bowl of nougat and threw it dramatically on the table to reveal that it was actually a thin chocolate shell. It cracked into pieces and released dehydrated coconut. As we swirled our spoons over the mixture, I could not help but squeal with delight. What an awe-inspiring finish!Overall opinion:After seeing this restaurant on the Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods because of its molecular gastronomy and modern presentations, I certainly discovered an adventurous way to eat.

Let's start at the beginning: About three years ago, my husband (then boyfriend) treated his parents and I to Alinea. He kept talking about this restaurant that was difficult to get reservations for, and was excited that we had somehow gotten lucky enough to secure a spot on a Friday night. I didn't pay too much attention to him, just figured that we were going to what was probably going to be a nice dinner. Even the fact that I knew beforehand that we were in for a 24 course extravaganza, which I hadn't ever heard of before, couldn't have prepared me in the slightest for the experience we were about to have. God, I had no idea back then. Anyhow, we arrive at the restaurant and have a seat near the window. We decide on the 24 course dinner with the wine pairing. The waiter brought us some perfectly wonderful and delicious bread, and my first instinct is to devour it until our server friend wisely advises us against this, telling us that if we skip anything, it's going to have to be the bread. Long story short, 24 courses and (I kid you not) a few tears of joy later, my life is forever changed. I have married my boyfriend, and we have tried to live more humbly in order to save up for experiences like the one we had at Alinea. We travel around the country, and indeed the world in search of the most amazing culinary experiences, ones that make you close your eyes and bury your face in your hands in utter and sublime disbelief.

Guess they all find their way into the fine dining world one way or another. My fault for wearing heels and a leopard print skirt to dinner, I guess? At the end of the night the douchebaggery and eye-raping was worth it because my parents love fine dining and could not stop raving about each course. They fell in love with this place.

Even more than a month ahead of time, the only available times were the wings - a little on the early side or later. We ended up coming here at 5:30 PM on Friday, and the room that we dined in was empty at this point. Although most upscale restaurants I've been to tend to usually have stiffer waiters, those that served us all seemed to have decent personality, which is nice. The atmosphere has a rather sparse modern air about it, which fits right in with what they are going for.I can understand why Alinea got 3 Michelin stars from the presentation aspect of it - all of the food is prepared and presented in immaculate fashion, and there are certain aspects - having the snapper tartare floating on top of an tall vase filled with ice water and flowers, serving soup in a wax shell, or covering the entire table with a rubberized tablecloth and preparing dessert ON the table itself - that lend a 'wow' factor. Eating here is a fun experience - a lot more fun than almost anywhere else I've been. But as for the food itself was a bit inconsistent; that is to say, none of the dishes were bad - but I expect to be blown away by nearly every dish at a restaurant of this caliber, and I wasn't, by far. We started with a butterscotch shooter served in a block of ice, which is a solid way to cleanse the palate. Next up was the seafood portion of the meal. I really enjoyed the halibut, which was very flaky but had some Mexican spices and avocado to give it a very interesting flavor. The scallops were also very delicious; you cook the two pieces on hot stones that are provided, and the broth they are marinated in provided a good, Asian-influenced flavor. The shrimp head was okay, if on the salty and slightly spicy side, and the snapper - both the tartare and the poached snapper that cooked in lemongrass broth - were okay, but neither the texture nor the flavors were that memorable. A small interlude of mushroom soup (that cooks on hot rocks that are on fire while you eat other dishes) had a very rich flavor, a tribute to how well the maitake mushrooms were prepared. The small cup of truffle soup was phenomenal, although having to rush to take a shot seemed unnecessary. The two meat dishes were duck and pork; the duck was served 5 ways (foie gras, mousse, breast, shredded, and confit), and you had a choice of 60(!) garnishes. It's great fun and innovative, but I think having that many choices can be overwhelming, and it sucks if you pick a garnish that doesn't go well with your limited amount of each preparation of duck. I also wasn't a huge fan of the mousse, which didn't really have much flavor at all, or the breast, which was a bit on the small side - so you couldn't get the breadth of the smokiness that duck meat is known for. The pork was forgettable, mainly because there were only 2 small cubes, and the sweet garnishes that it was served with overwhelmed the savory characteristics of the meat. The meal ended with a helium-filled balloon made out of apple - which, aside from basically tasting like an apple fruit roll-up, gives you the power of a chipmunk voice if you suck down the helium. Dessert finished up with a chocolate bowl filled with cotton candy and frozen ice cream chunks being loaded with liquid nitrogen and smashed on the table - with various citrus syrups and walnut brownie crumbles decorating the rest of the table. The presentation was great, but the actual dessert didn't really taste like much - it was disappointingly bland.Alinea is very unique in how the food is presented, and on that basis alone, it deserves very high marks. However, I just didn't feel like the food added up to what I feel is the benchmark for great food. There's no dish here that I would absolutely show up for, and while I understand that it's the experience itself that is the emphasis, restaurants, after all, are establishments that serve food. I'd come back again, just because it was a lot of fun and I'd want to see what other food is prepared, but it's nowhere close to the quality of other similarly-rated or priced restaurants that I've been to.", "Date": "2013-04-02", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Samantha H.", "ReviewID": "HdV8mzK0CkuP0rxbDkRkvQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been to Michelin star spots, I have to say the ambiance, service, and plating at Alinea is the best I've ever had. \u00a0I can see why it's so renowned. \u00a0 Upon walking in you walk through what looks like a haunted house. \u00a0They advised our first course \u00a0was in this tunnel but I somehow missed it (oh well, 17 others). \u00a0We were seated upstairs and the feel is quite different than anywhere else I've been. \u00a0They have everything broken into smaller dining room types with 6 or so tables in each and a huge open space in the middle with a server station. \u00a0So the four people that are serving that room have a very good interaction with everyone in that little room and the patrons in rooms next to you can't hear the casual conversations in the neighboring rooms. \u00a0The result is the feel that you're in someone's formal dining room with one on one interaction with their staff, who of course are more like family. \u00a0It surprisingly feels not pretentious since the casual and ongoing rapport with the staff feels more intimate and relaxed. \u00a0We also had the sommelier assist us in choosing a half bottle of sparkling and bottle of pinot to go with the meal. \u00a0I had read multiple reviews that advised against the pairing since the wines they typically use there are on the low end, despite having a very nice wine list. \u00a0We decided to take this advice and I'm happy we did. \u00a0The wine selections were outstanding and still less than we would have spent on the pairings. \u00a0One noticeable difference from other places with tasting menus is how it doesn't feel like rigid courses. \u00a0Because of the outstanding service and cohesiveness of the staff, the courses just felt so much more fluid. \u00a0It was not like here is one course, then take away, then wait for 10 minutes. \u00a0It felt more like a very smooth show rather than a structured 18 course meal.The menu was amazing. \u00a0To put that much thought into their menu, you know this place doesn't miss a thing. \u00a0The more to the right the circle is, the more savory the dish and the more to the left the sweeter. \u00a0The larger the circle, the larger the course. \u00a0And the darker the color, the bolder the flavors. \u00a0I was so impressed with this level of detail. \u00a0The courses themselves were a bit more hit or miss than the impeccable service. \u00a0The menu changes with the availability of ingredients, etc. so no need to focus on all of the individual courses but I did not care for the soda course. \u00a0It was a good idea but I did not get the lavender the way I expected to. \u00a0Another course I did not care for was the octopus. \u00a0I absolutely love octopus but it has to be prepared well to be good (I prefer a long braise followed by a char on the grill). \u00a0My husband and I both felt the octopus was a bit chewy unfortunately and the artichokes that were served with them had some flaws in the sense that they entire thing was not edible due

caviar fan and he was hugely impressed. \u00a0The duck course...oh the duck course. \u00a0Duck is my second favorite meat and I enjoyed all 5 of the duck preparations but mostly the garnishes (40 or so of em). \u00a0It was seriously amazing. \u00a0Lastly they give you a special tablecloth and a sous chef comes out and starts drawing and making art directly on the table with three different sauces. \u00a0The chocolate sphere is in the center of the table. \u00a0Now, I had seen the video so I knew what to expect but it was still so cool. \u00a0After the table is a masterpiece, they pick up that sphere and just break it all over. \u00a0You then eat it directly on the table. \u00a0Now that was the best presentation I've ever seen!Overall the creativity of the food was unparalleled, but

I surprised my boyfriend by flying him to Chicago and treating him here for his 25th birthday, and we both agreed it was the best meal of our lives (and we've been to Charlie Trotter's, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Chez Panisse, etc.).Even though we ordered the 12-course tasting, we actually got a bunch of extras that brought our total to a very generous 18 courses each (plus a special chocolate birthday dessert for my boyfriend). Favorites were the black truffle explosion, hot potato cold potato and the melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu beef, which was accompanied by a gourd that billowed A-1-scented smoke (really!) onto our table while we ate. Even the little things, such as the goat's milk butter that was served with the selection of bread, were wonderful. One of the most special parts of the evening was when Grant Achatz himself came out and personally prepared a dessert at our table that was inspired by a Jackson Pollack painting. He basically threw ingredients - including blueberries, maple and chocolate mousse - into an artistic heap that we then ate directly off the table (it was covered with a special material). I was totally starstruck when Grant came out, but he was very nice and chatted with us while he prepared the dessert. The service at Alinea was outstanding - attentive without being overbearing, informative without coming off as pompous. The ambiance was also a nice surprise - I was worried it would be stuffy and quiet, but guests were clearly very comfortable and the restaurant had a nice formal-but-fun air to it.At the end of the meal, we were presented with beautiful customized menus that took into account the different dishes we had for some courses (my boyfriend doesn't eat pork) and listed our wine pairings (we got nine wines total) under the courses they were served with. My boyfriend's menu even came with a special birthday message, which was a nice touch.I've wanted to go to the French Laundry for years, but now I'm thinking it will be very difficult to top this experience.

We had what is called the long menu which ed turned out to be 28 courses in whole.... And we had 13 wine pairings which went with dinner... The Food was awesome a complete experience and the presentations of the dishes \"WOW\" is all I can say... lol which i took pictures of the dishes.... seriously the presentation out of this freaking world..... The dishes covered Octopus, Lobster, Duck, Sturgeon, Goose, Venison, Pork Belly, and then some small interesting flavors..... Honestly I only remember 2 dishes in whole. 1 was called \"Bubble Gum\" which came in what looked like a dime bag of well us your imagination and anyways when you placed in your mouth it exploded with a mind blowing flavor.... IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME.... The 2nd was dessert and well I kid you not the chef comes out at this point and prepares the dessert and seriously the table... A Chocolate experience which again blows your mind not only on presentation but on flavor.... So back to the staff very I found them to be very dry and boring....

The duck with 60 different pairings was gorgeous, and the dessert of course was too. My favorite dessert was actually the strawberry and pine nuts with goats milk, most delectable dessert ever! Even better than the last course where they get all fancy and prepare it on the table. Service was of course impeccable.

I cannot express how awful it was in words but I'll try 1. The restaurant suggests formal attire (Jacket / no jeans) however their atmosphere did not match the dress requirements. It was very casual in a bad way. \u00a0When the hostess took us to our table, I asked her if we were at a waiting room / cocktail room before getting moved to the main dining room, but it was our actual table to experience our Tour - 24 courses. I also noticed that because of the way the tables were set up and bad ventilation, I could smell everyone else's food in the dining room. 2. \u00a0The chef added emphasized elements of scents to some of the dishes which were overpowering and not well composed. \u00a0For example, he put a full branch of mint in an outer bowl of a dish and the server poured hot water on top of it at the table side. \u00a0The mint scent was so strong and overwhelming that it not only destroyed the great soup but also lingered through the next 3 courses served. I could also smell the mint every time someone else in the room received the dish. I could smell the mint before the hot water was poured, I do not understand why he wanted such a strong sent with a dish. \u00a0I saw the chef Grant Achatz speaking about importance of scent on video. \u00a0 (videos.howstuffworks.com\u2026)3. The chef put more effort to create a dish which is \"different\" than \"great tasting\". \u00a0Yes some of the dishes such as Ice Fish were beautifully presented, but flavor composition and balance did not follow the beauty. \u00a0I believe importance of proportion and balance of ingredients comes before plate presentation. In this dish a lot of mayonnaise was used as glue to make the dried fish stand up. \u00a0The Mayonnaise's rich taste was so overpowering that it killed other taste components of the dish. \u00a0Also for the wagyu dish, a thinly sliced (shabushabu thickness) beef was frozen by liquid nitrogen then hung on a wire until defrosted and cooked on top of \u00a0the warm black truffle / potato. \u00a0I asked our server that other than the appearance, what does freezing the beef add to this dish. \u00a0He said it was just a presentation for us to enjoy watching the beautiful beef melt and change appearance... Freezing meat usually let moisture out of the cells thus make beef dehydrated. \u00a0I cannot see any good reason to freeze wonderful wagyu beef for just appearance...4. Some dishes such as Bacon which was hanging on a wire were inedible. \u00a0I understand why the chef coated bacon by butterscotch for this dish. \u00a0Fattiness and saltiness DO go with sweetness (same idea as fois gras with fruit compote, duck confit with balsamic reduction, or honey baked ham...) but the balance is the key.. \u00a0This dish was overly sweet and fatty, it was inedible.5. Some of the guests were unacceptably loud and obnoxious. \u00a0They were talking to us and other guests over other tables. \u00a0We were minding our own business, but few other guests were drunk and yelled at us inappropriately several times. \u00a0For example, our server presented a skewered dish served on a freestanding wire and told us to eat it without using hands. \u00a0The male guests on the next table shouted \"I wanna see you eat it\" (eating it with our mouth wide open without using hands / resembling a sexual act). \u00a0The dining environment was extremely uncomfortable so I asked our server if it was always same at the restaurant where the entire guests talk to each other. His answer was \"our guest enjoy lively atmosphere and even Wolfgang Pack is eating with us tonight.\" \u00a0The guests kept talking to each other over our table during whole dinner. \u00a0I enjoyed neither the food nor the atmosphere. We told our servers to stop bringing last few courses. \u00a0We left the restaurant without eating last 3 courses, paid for the entire \"Tour\", left over 15% tip and went out of the restaurant. \u00a0To be objective,Visual presentation: 4.3 / 5 pointsInnovativeness of dishes 5 / 5 pointsQuality of ingredients 4.2 / 5 pointsScent 1 / 5 pointsTaste of each component in a dish \u00a0 2.8 / 5 pointsComposition of flavor for the each dish 1.5 / 5 pointsFlow of the courses 2 / 5 pointsWine (independently from food) 5 / 5 pointsWine choices (paired with each dishes) 3.2 / 5 pointsServer's knowledge of food and wine) 3.9 / 5 pointsService (servers' customer service skills) 1.8 / 5 pointAtmosphere 1.4 / 5 pointsBottom line, I will not dine at Alinea even though they were at $40 per person (at 1/10 of the price point).*To clarify the questions by Matthew MI differentiate stars / overall experience from the points above1 = never go back2 = go back if there is a special event I have to attend3 = go back if convenient4 = go back5 = arrange a special trip", "Date": "2008-05-27", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Marissa D.", "ReviewID": "r_xFl5Js6dKtvi0ch4aNSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went into our dinner at Alinea a bit concerned.

Here is our story. \u00a0We arrive at 9:30 pm (a great time to have dinner) and are seated and given a shot of I am not sure what but it was a good idea based on what was to follow. \u00a0The sommelier (looked like he encountered hair dynamite on his way to work ) came out and I just mentioned that I hoped the wine pairings would not consist of a large amount of sweet white wine because we are serious red wine drinkers and this has happened before, \u00a0He told me that pretty much explained what was about to happen with the wine pairings. \u00a0He was 12 but had a bossy attitude and was tall for his age and obviously in charge. \u00a0 \u00a0 Anyway we asked if he could substitute some red wine for all of the white wine and he told us he could not. \u00a0Shocking response for the price they charge. \u00a0We were told if we wanted to spend additional money on a half bottle of red to get us through we were welcome to. \u00a0Really, are you kidding me?? \u00a0(The starting price was about $60 for anything decent. \u00a0How understanding of them???) \u00a0The first course was Sturgeon Roe covered with foam and I was seriously disturbed by the textures. \u00a0Small postules that popped in your mouth and screamed fish more than you would ever want or hope for. \u00a0One bite and I was done. \u00a0Actually I was seriously traumatized. \u00a0They noticed that both of us did not touch the first course and offered to bring us some thing else. \u00a0Humorouly enough after the dinner we realized that they just brought us the second course, not something additional. \u00a0Go figure! Hot potato cold potato was amazing thank goodness. \u00a0The next course was razor neck clams and scallops in a bunch of gelatinous goop with more foam (which I now hate) which could have been good without the creepy slimy textures. \u00a0So this restaurant is all about textures but it is about bad textures not good textures. \u00a0The rest of the courses were a mix of creepy slimy mayonnaise like textures. \u00a0One spoonful is tasty but cups of it become creepy and gross. \u00a0The highlights were the pork belly and Wagyu beef (amazing and was almost worth the $600 dollar price tag of our dinner)but considering that 9 out of 12 courses were creepy and gross I have to give it 2 stars. \u00a0Service was good but did not equal Charlie Trotters. \u00a0The popcorn course was exhausting and contained way too much mayonnaise type goop. \u00a0I did not get it and after dinner we made a pact to never do another multi course again for the rest of our lives. \u00a0 The dessert course were right out of a weird science fiction movie. \u00a0We had to suck weird things out of tubes (it did not taste that good by the way) \u00a0Okay and then we have the bacon on a trapeze. What was up with that? \u00a0Silly to say the least. \u00a0These people spent money on a wire contraption to suspend the bacon like it was in traction. \u00a0The aromatic things were a waste of time. \u00a0I got yelled at for putting a dirty spoon on the pillow. \u00a0Summary was we would not go back if you paid us $600 dollars. \u00a0The decor was boring the food was creepy and the service was basic. \u00a0For the same money we went to Spiaggia the next night and were blown away. \u00a0Now that is a restaurant. \u00a0If I never encounter foam for the rest of life it would be too darn soon. I am not sure why everyone loves this place. \u00a0Maybe they are not eating enough mayonnaise in their diets are are craving it immensely and that is why they love Ilinea. I cannot figure out how everyone rates this restaurant a 5 because I do not see it. \u00a0 If you agree with this review we would love to hear from you. \u00a0I did not complain because after Trotters let down I gave up on expensive multicourses and really am over it!P. S. \u00a0The wine pairings were a joke. \u00a0I could have gone into their cellar and done an eeny meeny moe picking and come up with better wine pairings. \u00a0And that really pissed us off! There were only two wine pairings that actually made sense the rest were a joke. \u00a0So the 12 year old was not very good and needs to go back to wine school and get a hair cut. \u00a0Yes my husband and I are spoiled brats and make better food in our kitchen every day.

I'm going to be true to myself. Alinea is first and foremost one of the cutting edge restaurant in the US and I've been wanting to go for the longest time. They invent flavors I haven't had and actually has woken me up in terms of flavor and texture. The following is what I had:1) Macintosh Apple Cider2) Butternut Muscovado, finger lime, West Indies3) Oyster leaf mignonette4) Sea Urchin with white chocolate, yuzu, wasabi (top 3)5) Lobster - trinity, sherry, chervil6) Top Neck Clam - shiso, soy, daikon7) Otoro - Thai Banan, sea salt, kaffir lime8) Corn - huitlacoche, sour cherry, silk9) Arctic Char - sage, bourbon, upland crest10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle (top 3)11) Matsutake mushroom with pork belly, huckleberry, pine12) Black Truffle explosion - romaine, parmesan (top 3)13) 3 styles lamb (shoulder, belly, sirloin) with 50 different condiments 14) Woodcock tempura - lingonberry, shallot, oak leaves15) giner - five other flavors16) carrot - coconut, white sesame, caramelized honey17) balloon - helium, green apple18) Dark chocolate - rye, birch syrupMost of these dishes have really unique characteristic. It's fun but yet focused on flavor. It uses cutting edge technique (the white chocolate, yuzu foam makes me crave more). Black truffle explosion (having the soup explode in your mouth).Although it tastes good and it's a fun meal, it lacks a bit of substances. For me personally, I do crave some meat. or a pasta/risotto dish, where the chef can highlight the use of those ingredients but using cool technique to do it (the lamb was a bad execution in my personal opinion because there's no explanation of the different condiments, but the lamb is good). Also, the lack of dessert (ok..the dark chocolate is cool to look at but the flavor wasn't the best. So not the best way to end the night in terms of flavor). I think that's what is lacking for me. But I can see the bigger picture, the technique, the flavor, the texture. It makes sense but it doesn't. Perhaps that's why they call this a show and not a meal.

I went for the tour the first time in February 2008 for the one-year anniversary with boyfriend, and again in May 2008 for alinea's 3 year anniversary.Those who think of it as solely a meal are the ones who miss out on the nuances, and take away nothing but a four hour dinner. No - this is performance art, at its finest - edible.There are some unconventional presentations they repeat and alter the composition of: a dish with a waxy ball of some juice that explodes in your mouth, a \"shot\" glass of a mixture, food on a thin wire that involves no hands, a bowl of rich soup that can't be put down until you finish, with a biteful of something that complements on top, a silver pick, etc. It's hard to review all the dishes in one meal, let alone two, in 5000 characters, so I'm just going to review the memorable ones: bad and good.Chicken Skin: truffle, corn, thyme. A one biter, yet underwhelming - texture, flavor, none of it was there. They should take this off, because it felt like an afterthought to me.Sweetbread: cauliflower, burnt bread, toasted hay. I have the utmost respect for Chef Grant, but this dish hit a sour note for me. I hated the hard/crunchy cauliflower. There were these tan and black dots adorning a \"village\" that tasted terrible and enhanced the awfulness of everything else. Presentation was cute, but this dish's flavors and textures stunk with me.Transparency of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt: Tasted like potpourri with the texture of baked saran wrap. not my favorite, obviously.But 3 bad dishes out of 52? Not bad. As for the great dishes:Beans: many garnishes, pillow of nutmeg air. This included a marshmallow and fruit leather, centered around a navy bean puree which was topped with pancetta and a guinness beer foam. Unforgettably rich.Roasted pear: foie gras, candied fennel, sweet spices. It was like a \"cover\" of foie over a buttery soup, and they poured more hot soup to melt it. The tastes were totally harmonious. I've only ever had foie fresh at the foire du paris and so i'm picky about my foie, but I loved this.Caramel corn: *liquified*. Our server's presentation: \"well this is intermission, and what do you get at intermission? caramel corn!\" I'd heard bad things (weird, caramel corn shouldn't be liquified, etc.) It was lovely, smooth and tasted exactly like caramel corn, but the aftertaste was great - not buttery or gross, just faint and light.Wagyu Beef: black trumpets, cedar branch aroma. This bite of beef was SO amazing - I'd fly to Japan for it. Boyfriend insisted that the beans were still his favorite, but when I pointed out it was merely a quantity comparison (i.e. if he had less of the beans and more of the beef) he acknowledged I was right.Ice fish: shellfish, horseradish, parsley. One of my favorites, with fried ice fish (japanese delicacy) sticking up out of a custard of shellfish and horseradish (not at all spicy, very very good) with fried potato - like fish and chips except 34280785723094582 times better.Short rib: guinness, peanut, fried broccoli. Imagine a sheet of guinness - even without it, the braised short rib was amazing.Fava beans: lavender, banana, pecorino - i didn't love this so much as the BACON DONUT that came with it, good lord almighty.Lobster: peas, ramps, mint vapor. This might have been my absolute favorite had it not been for the slightly overwhelming peppermint/spearmint smell. Yet it was ridiculously tasty. Strawberry: violet, nicoise olive. holy gizmo, quite literally. An everlasting gobstopper mixed with \"willywonka\" technique of the gum that changed flavors in your mouth. I don't even like olives but it was delicious and the layers melded together beautifully.Hot Potato: Cold Potato, black truffle, butter. The server came out and I recognized it from pictures online. \"OOOH it's the potato\" he laughed, \"yes!\" This is such a signature dish and after tasting it, I know why. One of those few duets that complement each other in every way possible. Temperature, texture, taste - all kicked ass, and the parmesan cubes were wonderful.Chocolate: egg, pomelo, smoke. Our favorite dessert, hands down. a pool of pomelo, some valhrona chocolate infused with tea, a chocolate brioche bridge, a funky chocolate covered egg and smoke gel.With 20+ dishes being served at a meal, a few may not strike your palate perfectly, but it's definitely worth the trip.

sesame seeds stuck to lips and tablecloth. \u00a0While we enjoyed the yuba, we watched dashi brew in a siphon. \u00a0The clear pot held seaweed, konbu, bonito, scallion, ginger, yuzu, and mirin, and when the broth was done, it was served with a delicate cube of scallop mousseline, fried to imitate agedashi tofu, garnished with cucumber, nasturtium, wasabi, carrot, chive, celery, and yuzu rind. \u00a0The scallop was utterly delicious, with a slight crust and creamy insides. \u00a0The broth and aromatics were irresistible, and I was glad when we got a cup of dashi to sip on. \u00a0A long metal antenna impaled our next course, a bite of Hungarian wooly ham and hibachi-grilled squid, with sherry, orange, and fennel, which we plucked with our teeth. \u00a0The tender squid fell just short of overpowering the ham, but they played together nicely.Then we drank our centerpiece. \u00a0It was filled with a sweet floral juice of beet, hibiscus, and Italian licorice, which we had standing with glass straws. \u00a0After that came an interlude of Sicilian family style dining, a way for Achatz to show that anything you can do, he can do better. \u00a0Moist, flaky, herb roasted Atlantic scup came filleted over garlic basil mint puree, with sides of panella chickpea crackers and caponata, and a ramekin of Sicilian sea salt. \u00a0The fish was perfectly cooked, and fritters were fun and crunchy. \u00a0The caponata was the ultimate rustic side, with firm eggplant and raisins, capers, olives, pine nuts, and celery. \u00a0The scup also came with wine - a pouring of French chardonnay, in ornate glasses.***", "Date": "2012-01-23", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Suzanne S.", "ReviewID": "67PU-Kg_DAg6UcJwBAF4TA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly the best dinner I have ever had. \u00a0EVER. \u00a0I'm a vegetarian and they catered to my dietary restrictions with no problems. \u00a0I thought that I would definitely be left in the dust feeling like my meal wouldn't command the expense but I was wrong. \u00a0Every dish was innovative and tasted incredible.

It's a fixed menu, nothing disappoints. End of story. What was a big dilemma for me was the wine - pairing menu? By the glass? A couple of bottles? What to do! My one gripe about Alinea is the lack of transparency for the wine program. There is no detail provided about the pairing menu prior to dining, other than the cost of ~$150. From what I gather, this includes 9 or so small pours of wine. The sommelier was a bit rude when I told him we'd not be doing the wine pairings. After reading many reviews and talking to friends who had been to Alinea before, it seemed it was not worth it. I would have happily spent $300 had I felt it was the right thing to do, but others told me otherwise. I asked the sommelier about starting with a sparkling, then white, red and finishing with a dessert wine. He quipped that \"That is NOT how our pairing menu is set up\" as if I were trying to knock it off. I ended up letting him choose three wines for us that were from the pairing menu but not offered on the wine list. The tab came to $77 with tip for 2 people. My glass was never empty, I loved the wine and I spent 1/4 of what we would have on pairings. In the end, sommelier delivered, despite his curt demeanor at the beginning of the night. The rest of the waitstaff was fantastic, the food was astonishing and fun. One of the best meals of my life.

The cuisine here is the real deal, seriously innovative and genuinely delicious. Some places have one or the other, but Alinea has both and it pushes both to the limits throughout the course of your meal. And \"meal\" is a term that should be used loosely, as the Alinea experience is one of bites and tastes, both small and large, spread over a long period of time and a variety of elaborate presentations. Some of the bites were interesting and challenging, some were comforting and simply tasted great. I will always remember Hot Potato Cold Potato, Black Truffle Explosion, and the Blueberry/Sorrel dessert that preceded the final dessert presentation on the silicone mat.It's a big deal and a very costly expense to eat dinner here.

After you valet ($10) your car, you enter into a discreet looking gray building which you would never surmise to be a Culinary Heaven. Upon entering, at first, you feel like you are entering a posh nightclub, with floor moldings full of pink backlighting. Your resy is confirmed and you make your way to your table. You immediately notice that tables are against the wall with ample walk room. As you sit, you notice a pair of chopsticks in a metal vessel holding up what appears to be sandwiched edible flowers between summer roll rice paper sheets. You are told not to touch and are left to your imagination as to what that will be used for later. Upon sitting, your waiter asks if you have any dietary restrictions to cater to. You state them and the feast begins.THE MENUSince I wanted to enjoy dinner sans taking notes, I asked the waiter if I could request a menu after the dinner service was complete, hinting that I wrote about food. Unbeknownst to me, you are never shown it during service, but the menu is tweaked for each guest and you receive a (virtually indestructible) dated custom menu on your way out. As for the menu itself, the fuzzy circles represent a map of your meal - the area of the circle corresponds to the size of the course, and it's left-to-right position corresponds to its relative sweetness or savoriness. A stroke of pure genius IMO. We were told the menu evolves daily and changes every season so I will definitely be back!THE DISHESEach dish..scratch that..food vessel is tailor made to GA's liking, most of it being stainless steel and minimalist. There was the squab dish that was served over a birch log a lobster dish which had literally 3 layers of food, reminding me of a Russian babushka doll. The sheer number of ingredients used to prepare each dish is a remarkable feat in and of itself. Those who actually cook will appreciate that. If you notice the ordering of the entrees, they don't sequentially go from light to heavy. The hostess agreed w/ me when I mentioned palate fatigue so they know how to change it up. Note the curvature and size of the bubbles on the menu change as an intentional way of circumventing that.PICSGA hates bloggers & pics so I think the lighting is intentional. NO FLASH so pics were still taken but none of which I would proudly publish. When GA himself prepared our dessert AT OUR TABLE (perhaps hinting about writing about food had something to do with this, as the table next to us only got his Sous Chef...Suckers!), we didn't force the issue of taking a pic with him, although we were feening for one. THE FOODSome dishes were farfetched for me. ALMOST EVERY DISH was on point, besides the eucalyptus which overpowered the squab and the steelhead roe w/ plantain, ginger, papaya which was served in a candy purse, which messed with my senses, teetering back and forth from sour to sweet and vice versa. In the 2nd to last dessert, the lemon was too tart and didn't synch with the white chocolate, despite the ingenious idea of serving the plate OVER a deflating earl grey infused pillow. BTW, I later came to find out that the summer roll rice paper sitting on our table was for the deconstructed summer roll dish which had this CRACKTACULAR pork confit in it. On the flip side, if I had to name ONE DISH that blew me away, it would have to be their signature BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION. You are told beforehand not to face your dining companion and to clench your mouth shut before biting, and for good reason.THE PI\u00e8CE DE R\u00e9SISTANCEGrant serving you dessert...AT YOUR TABLE? Are you kidding me? No other high end restaurant has done that for me. The unforgettable finale was that of a NITROGEN CHOCOLATE MOUSSE emptied out from a loaf pan, chipped at with a custom mini metal dagger and placed atop a soft gray silicone tablecloth. Chunks of chewy white coconut are then placed strategically before Grant uses a metal spoon to create a coconut milk dotted trail, one dot smaller than the next. Menthol is also placed randomly and turns into a square shape, with hyssop meticulously placed over it with tweezers. He then walks away and you are left in awe of what just transpired, too fixated on the Chef to have paid attention to his 'tangential' actions at the time. What a jizzmatic combination of flavors.

I don't know Chef Achatz personally, I'm not a \"foodie\" and I don't care to be. I'm not rich or spiritual or any of that, I just know that going to Alinea was an experience; an incredible one at that, which I will NEVER forget. Obviously the experience was even more memorable because it was my 2 year anniversary and I have never spent more than $50 dollars on a single meal, but the waiters and the hostess and even Chef Achatz himself made concerted efforts to make our night as pleasant as possible. I'm a vegetarian, on top of that I am also an EXTREMELY picky eater. But when you make a reservation at Alinea, the scheduler asks if there are dietary restrictions, most people just say \"no meat\" or \"no gluten\" My list was about 15 different things...when we got to the restaurant, our waiter memorized all 15 items and repeated it to me just to reconfirm... All of the dishes that included duck, or lobster, etc. were replaced by fennel or mushrooms, just for me. This is the kind of effort that is put into each experience. I was so blown away by that consideration. Each dish was mesmerizing, even if I didn't specifically enjoy certain flavors (I forgot to mention I'm not a huge fan of menthol or eucalyptus) the purity of each flavor completely drew me in every single time. What makes this restaurant extraordinary, and each meal in itself spectacular, is the work that goes into it, the respect that Chef Achatz has for each and every flavor he presents to you. Nothing is muddled, every taste is distinct and seriously, probably took years to perfect. I can honestly say that I was not a fan of a couple of pieces I ate that night, but in retrospect it wasn't about ordering something that was a safe staple in my diet, it was about experiencing and trying new things, tasting flavors in their most potent forms and having someone present to you their life's work. I've always had trouble defining what art is, but this was it. It was aesthetically pleasing, there was so much passion, hard work, sacrifice, precision and in the end the product was exactly as it was intended to be. This experience is not for the closed-minded or the faint of heart. You really have to be mentally prepared for 24 courses. At this point, it's no longer just sustenance for your body; it's about taking note of the beauty of each element of flavor and respecting those who spend their entire lives cultivating that. If you really can't take a closer look at what people like Grant Achatz are doing for the culture of food, then we really are just a fast food nation uninterested in anything else except gorging ourselves and going to places like McDonalds.", "Date": "2010-04-05", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Eve K.", "ReviewID": "k-8yQiVd_i6-766hhq0CtQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unique dining experience mixing art with food: in the decor as well as the actual meal. Tiny bites but big flavors. 4.5 stars. Was holding out on this last Chicago one for my 500th review of my first 15 months as a yelper. 8-)Cost to worth it rating: 3 (~$300/person for 12 course tasting menu, wine pairing, and gratuity) Eve award: best version of A1 sauce. Pics: yelp.com/biz_photos/pbEi\u2026Highlights: - Atmosphere: upon arriving at the location, the experience begins. The actual door is a bit hard to find, then you walk down a pink lit short hall with no sign of an entrance, only to have the elevator-like doors to the left automatically open up. Part Willy Wonka, part Sci-Fi, and part modern art... kinda like the cuisine. Dining room is very minimalistic, set up as the canvas for the food to come. - Instruction: it's a step away from the norm when you receive verbal instructions on how to eat the dish when you're presented with each course. Ex. eat the spoon of Thai flavored jelly and then the rest of the plate, pull these things off the pin and let it drop before eating, suck in the cigar shaped tube with 3 layers of gelatin substances to taste like bubblegum, open wide and shoot a big hard-shelled white circle filled with fluid, etc.- Scent: a few plays on this sense in the aroma within the slowly deflating lilac pillow our plate was sitting on top of to the mysterious black vase which later spouted out smoke volcano style that provided the essence of a backyard grill. - Steak and potatoes: their version was one of the highlights. A small piece of succulent wagyu beef paired with a pureed potato encrusted in salt and vinegar potato chips. The fun here besides the bbq smoke was the deconstructed A1 sauce: they took all the random ingredients that make up this iconic steak sauce and reverse engineered it to recreate it in powder form and presented it in a plastic pouch. This was freaking cool. \u00a0- Bacon: slimmest crispiest piece of bacon I've ever had with a touch of sweetness from butterscotch and a sliver of apple tied around it, all presented hanging off of a silver arch we pulled it off of. - Butter: dish highlighting Paula Dean's best friend. Lobster and popcorn with a jelly cube of enclosed clarified butter. - Sweet potato: brown sugar cinnamon crispy exterior reminiscent of that fried taro semi-spiny looking ball at dim sum covered the potato on a stick. My favorite sweet. - Coconut bread: of the 3 breads we tried, this was by far the best. Toast with a bit of coconutty sweetness.- Pork belly: I've never had it before and was a bit scared but the taste was part bacon and part pulled pork. This was surrounded in a Thai curry sauce and eaten after the spoon of Thai flavors of fish sauce, lemon grass, etc. in a clear jelly format. - Pepper ice cream: I liked ground pepper so this worked for me--even when paired with asparagus. - Wine: great pairings but even better was the extent of the description that accompanied each pour. Not only did you get the varietal and producer but region and story behind it all. As a wine-lover, I dug this. La Sirena syrah was incredible... the famous winemaker that has received a perfect 100 point from Robert Parker in previous creations and this particular winery is in Napa--yeay! - Comfy seating: we were upstairs and I sat on the booth side of the table that was so soft, luxurious, and comfortable. - Service: lots of help, as a different person seemed to expertly present each course to us. They noticed we came in a cab and without us asking, made sure one was waiting for us at the completion of our meal.- Menu: after you're done, they present you with a printed out menu in a folder (including wine pairings), joking that it's your diploma. I was impressed, as the hub's had his non-seafood items included so it was personalized and not just cookie cutter. Midlights: - Lengthy process: prep yourself for a 3 hour meal even for the half menu of 12 courses. Get comfy and enjoy. 3 courses actually came at the same time which was nice, as we were getting tired half way through even the shorter menu. Lowlights: - After a few tables sat next to us who ordered the full 24 course menu, our main waiter rarely stopped by our table any longer and was more quick to pour our wine and go. - Chocolate dessert: blanket layer of waxy chocolate covering prune, olive, and pine flavors was not for me. Interesting experience to say the least. Took a bit of reflection upon the evening to appreciate the extent of it all, but since it was so memorable and I notice myself telling everyone about it, I'd like to do it all again. :-)", "Date": "2009-04-15", "Author_Location": "Sunnyvale, CA"}, {"Author": "Michael J.", "ReviewID": "8OiGXGDBGtHvL638WpHW7g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hands down the best meal I've ever had (sorry mom). \u00a0This dining experience is simply amazing. I went expecting great food, but what surprised me was the rest of the experience. The food is presented as a show for the table. Each dish is a piece of beautiful artwork and many are really fun to experiment with. One of the highlights was a 60 treasures duck where we each got three pieces of duck and a giant plate with 60 different garnishes/sauces. With no instruction we mixed and matched and came up with our favorite combinations. Another really fun one was a green apple helium balloon; I think it was the first course of the three dessert courses. The entire balloon was edible and made for great laughs around the table as it stuck to your face and you tried to talk with the high pitch helium voice. I won't give up the grand finale dessert, but needless to say each dish was beautiful, had a science feel, and tasted spectacular. I'd also recommend the wine pairings - had some spectacular rare wines from around the world.

If you have to choose between the 24 course or the 12 and wine, go with the 24 however. The wines are expertly chosen, but you don't want to miss the food. If you don't have to choose, good for you.Lemongrass - This was a kumumoto oyster will tiny chilis, ginger, and yuzu served with a lemongrass stalk as a serving utensil. Fava Beans - 'Tis the season for favas. This elaborate display started with white pillows filled with lavender vapor. Atop the pillows, the server placed a parfait of fava pure, freeze dried banana, olive oil balls, and a lavender gelato. Shaved pecorino on top. \u00a0Spring Garlic - Holding onto a ball while eating chicken jelly is not something that I am ready to admit that I have done before, but this was fun. The soup bowl was perfectly spherical and the bite that came with the bowl was lemon with chicken jelly on top. The soup was a puree of spring garlic and was greatIce Fish - Ice fish are these tiny Antarctic fish fried whole and served with fried chips of horseradish, garlic, and potato. It was a fun take on fish and chips. There also were whole asparagus and asparagus emulsion. More ice fish were ground into a tartar like paste. Lobster - This was my favorite savory course. The first setting is a large bowl filled with mint leaves. The second bowl was lobster, ramp puree, spring peas, and foam. As an interruption, we were served lobster crisps with crme. The large bowl was filled with boiling hot water to release the mint vapor and the dish was spectacular. The ramp bulbs were served whole, the greens pureed and mixed with the spring peas and lobster; it was a perfect encapsulation of spring. Not to mention the free facial. Waygu Beef - When course four was served another server came by with what appeared to be table flags. We were told to look, but not touch. When course 6 came by, we got our plate with what appeared to be a tiny simple maki piece. As we glanced at our \"flags\", we noticed that they were slices of beef frozen in liquid nitrogen and were now mostly thawed. The \"maki\" was potato with rendered waygu fat wrapped in a black truffle. The waygu was placed atop what we now realized was a very hot plate and the worked like an amazing meat tarp over the truffle and potato. Aged sherry and more rendered waygu fat topped the course. Short Rib - This course was a perfectly tender short rib boned and place with ramp puree under a gelatinous sheet made from Guinness. Atop the sheet was carmelized broccoli and peanut. Squab - By this time, I was sweating. I needed a cigarette; and I don't even smoke. The squab was decidedly controversial and, as the server noted, was for many diners. The \"loin\" of squab was roasted. Another was placed in chocolate and baked. The dish was flanked by pickled blueberries, hazelnut crme, and spring garlic puree. Chicken skins were ground and used as \"soil\". eaten. Bacon -Bacon on a wire wrapped in butterscotch, smoked by apple wood, and served with a spring of thyme. Carrot - This was a carrot cake. Not any carrot cake that I have ever heard of, but it was great. The spice strip was a Listerine type strip, but instead of making me more appealing on the CTA, this one tasted of nutmeg and cinnamon and made me think of holidays past. \u00a0The cake was served with a red curry and date puree. There was a marble sized capsule filled with ginger water. The \"soil\" on top was ground pistachio. Chocolate - This is one of the most indescribable food items that I have ever seen and I can only compare it to Jackson Pollack or that drink that you make in a garbage can in college. It was pomelo capsules and juice, smoke capsules, miniflowers, egg yolk in a chocolate capsule, and smoke cream in a brownie brioche shell. Had we not been told to mix it, it would have been a disaster. It has so many offputtingly sexy flavors and textures that it couldn't go together right? Wrong. It was a masterpiece. Sweet Potato - How would you end such an extra extravagant affair, but with flaming cinnamon stick with sweet potato pie tempura on the end lollypop style? It was crunchy and bourbony. You'll notice that I used perfect a lot, but in truth much of the dinner was just that, perfect. The service was wonderful, the wine was great, and the food was out of this world. The creativity involved was inspirational and the valets were prompt. Don't be intimidated by the food. Be intimidated by the price.

I won't recount every course, just highlight the dishes that made me laugh, or let me know this was a restaurant like no other, a place where there were no rules that had to be followed, a sanctuary which allowed a chef freedom to go wherever imagination led.For example, while the beverage choices were explained, six bowls containing blocks of ice resting on beds of pebbles were placed on the table, without a word being said about what they were for. Each block had a hole drilled in the center, and once we'd made our decisions about what we'd be drinking, servers then came to the table with glass straws filled with steelhead roe in a liquid and stoppered at either end with foam.We were instructed to take our straws, fit them into the perfectly sized hole, now filled with ice melt, and inhale the mixture in a single slurp as quickly and as loudly as we could. The frigid rush of roe and herbs and peach (I'm unsure whether that fruit flavor came from the straw or the melt) was sweet and salty and made us giggle, a perfect start to the most unusual meal of my life.For Lamb 86, we were each presented with a narrow plate containing three perfect pieces of lamb, each prepared in a different manner, and two plexiglas shields were placed in the center of the table, each with 86 different garnishes, none of them identified, but all, we were promised, fitting accompaniments to the lamb. I cut the three tender servings into three smaller pieces so I could experience more of the flavor combinations, and the table turned into a guessing game as we each plucked the sides that tempted us and tried to identify what we'd chosen.Not every course was as unusual in its presentation as that. Some courses astonished with their perfection alone. Hot Potato, Cold Potato, which we were told was one of the oldest courses that still remained on the Alinea menu, consisted of a paraffin bowl filled with cold potato soup, while a hot potato and a piece of truffle were held aloft by a skewer which went through the lip of the bowl. We were to pull the pin, and the moment the two ingredients met, we were to toss it back, so the soup had no time to warm, the potato no time to chill, and the two flavors and temperatures only came together on the tongue. Then there was the Black Truffle Explosion, which was served on a spoon, and to be chewed with closed lips, so none of the delectable juice escaped. These awed not by the science fictional nature of their presentations, but from the precise combination of their ingredients, eaten at exactly the right moment.One course that makes clear why a dish must be eaten when served is the green apple helium balloon, which if not ingested upon delivery, would, I fear, end up collapsing upon itself before eaten. The skin of the balloon as well as the string with which we held it were both made of apply taffy, and we were told to press our lips against the balloon, take a bite, and inhale. My mouth filled immediately with the intense flavor of apple--and with helium as well, of course--so we were all soon talking about how amazing it tasted while sounding like Mickey and Minnie Mouse.For our final course, the table was cleared, and we were asked to lift our glasses as a silicone covering was rolled out. Servers then brought many small bowls, two metal jugs sweating with condensation, and three white globes with circular holes in their tops. Then two chefs arrived, and began spooning out the contents of the bowls onto the table, scattering them like culinary Jackson Pollacks as they identified each--freeze-dried strawberry, English pea, buttermilk cream, and so on.Then the chefs each lifted a jug and announced, \"liquid nitrogen,\" and poured the contents into the white globes, which caused a fog to rise and cover the table. Finally, the chefs lifted the globes, which were made of white chocolate, and smashed them upon the table, revealing the goodies within--meringues, cotton candy, miniature jelly donuts, condensed honeydew melon, and more. After which we took our spoons and attacked, not making as much of a dent as the creation deserved.At meal's end, we stepped out of the restaurant ... four hours and thirty-nine minutes after we had arrived.Yes. The meal took four hours and thirty-nine minutes. But I assure you that it did not feel as if that much time had passed, because ... oh, I'm going to go into cliche mode now, but you know how it's sometimes said that time stood still? Well, time didn't stand still, per se, but ... let's just say that while we were in Alinea, it didn't exist.

It's somewhat chic but very plain--some minimalist, modern decor and overall a \"clean\" look--but frankly, quite boring. I'm not asking for Trump styling, but I do think that even to achieve a modern/sleek look they could have put some more effort into it. The ambiance just wasn't at all what I expected... not bad, just kind of lame.I looked past this and remained excited for the meal. With the buzz about this place, and the price tag, I expected to be BLOWN AWAY. Instead, I found most of the dishes odd, salty, and just... not yummy. The savory dishes and elements were salty and had strong, mismatched flavors... I especially did not like the rabbit consumme--I could barely get it down the hatch (though I did try, since it was so expensive!). The pineapple \"sheet\" and foams didn't even taste sweet... just odd.

If you think fast food is actually food, you won't like Alinea. If you are the kind of person who thinks that the more money you spend, the more quantity of food you should get, walk AWAY and never think of coming to Alinea again.Now, having said all that: ALINEA IS FOOD PORN. There is no way you could possibly replicate the experience at home, and probably 99% of all restaurants in this country couldn't come close. It is as good as everyone says it is. There were only two things I would have changed about the experience. Firstly, the reservationist was a bit snooty. For a Five Star dining experience, I kind of expect that the whole thing--from the people you talk to on the phone all the way to the guy who hails you a cab at the end of the evening--should be top notch. Secondly: the staff at Alinea are a veritable treasure trove of information. However they seemed to be a tad stiff and if I attempted to go beyond the usual \"what's this??!\" question format, they seemed uncomfortable and scurried off.Finally--the reviews are true. The 20+ tasting course is a lot of flavors (not necessarily a lot of food), but it is well worth it, as are the expertly selected wine pairings. To prepare for this meal, I ate very little all day leading up to it and had a nice round of cardio at the gym before I went.

Second best restaurant I have ever dined at.This was the third attempt at dining at Alinea. Our first two had to be \u00a0cancelled due to last minute work conflicts. So when the event finally came, we were stoked.Be warned, there is no sign that we could see. We drove past the place twice without finding it. Finally we saw the valet sign and voila, we were in! The entrance is a little spooky. It is a dark corridor that tapers narrower the deeper in you go. We crept our way through the dark to the end and a sliding door a la Star Trek silently opened beside us and an immaculately dressed man greeted us warmly. Very spooky indeed. We were immediately let upstairs to our gigantic table for two in a sparsely decorated room that could be on the cover of Wallpaper magazine. The main decoration were these space age lillies in glass vases with the Japanese rock embellishments. The colors were all soothing browns and mauves to tone down the off white linens. And guess what? The linens were actually MADE OUT OF LINEN! Not cotton, not silk, not satin, but LINEN. What a nice touch.There was nothing but the linens adorning the table. The wine menu was like a work of bloody Russian realist ficiton, with 600 or more protaganists, all of them larger than life itself (most north of $80 per bottle). I was a little too peckish and thirsty to read part one of War and Peace so we just ordered what the Sommelier suggested - a champagne cocktail made by mixing a boutique Champagne with just a smidge of sweet dessert wine. Delicious. The Sommelier pushed the wine pairings option, which he describes as painstakingly matched to each course, and rather than making a Tolstoyan effort at the wine list I decided to submit to our Sommelier's will.The meal: 14 courses, all small, many bite-sized, but in whole just a little too much food (which to me is the perfect amount)Every dish was both a work of Art, and a work of Science - in particular, a work of Chemistry. From the octopus nestled in a pillow of papaya with a spoon for a bed, suspended above a bowl of warmed, coconut-infused soy milk , to the black truffle juice someow stuffed to tightly into a ravioli that it literally explodes into your mouth when you bite it (if you are not careful you spew it all over your date) -- this meal is the yin and yang of dining. Most of the courses are really beyond description, and many of the flavor combinations I have never seen before - think bacon with butterscotch; brie or avocado ice-cream; chocolate and lemongrass; apple and horseradish -- get the picture? The amazing thing is, it all works. Plus every course has a science gimmick -- such as your plate sitting on a pillow that has been filled with lavender scented air so that as you eat the weight of the pillow pushes the air out for you to smell with your food; or a licorice cake that is somehow perfectly skewered on a flexible metal rod that somehow suspends just before your cake-hole, so that you can just stick your face into it and have at it, reminding you of the good old caveman days before knives and forks; or like the magical chocolate ball that sat innocently in its bowl until the waiter poured hot white chocolate milk onto it and the top half (AND ONLY THE TOP HALF) of the ball melted away, revealing a cross-section of outer chocolate crust, a molten white chocolate lava mantle, and a chocolate brownie core. How the hell do they DO these things???Service was almost on the casual side, as the jocular waiters encouraged us to chow down on the licorice cake, and use our fingers to rip into the bacon and butterscotch, but at that place it works. The Sommelier did not dissapoint - the parings were indeed perfectly matched. But that brings me to why I don't like wine pairings. There are always a bubbly course, two to three white wine courses, two red wine courses and one or two sweet wine courses. Well, call me caveman, but I generally would rather have like eight bubbly courses or maybe eight red courses, or maybe four and four. I don't like sweet wine much, and some white wines I just find boring. So next time I will skip the pairing and instead I'll just get mediaeval on the 600 bottle wine list. Finally, I wish there was some kind of music, even if it was almost imperceptable music. A piano, a string section, something. The restaurant was packed but it was so quiet you could hear the waiters at the other tables, and you could hear everyone else's conversations. So it made us self-conscious of our conversations. If I'm going to drop $600 for two people for dinner, I don't want to feel embarrassed when I get loosened up and start telling my date about my Joan Jett fetish...Other nice touches -- replacing the LINEN napkin with a new one every time you go to the rest room, a different type of bread with each course, custom made dinnerware designed around each course, and at the end they bring you the printed menu for a keepsake.

Our last dish was a bubble-yum hibiscus cigarette thing that made a funny low pitched grunt as you sucked the contents into your mouth). \u00a0This was not just dinner, it was a show. \u00a0The whole experience seemed to throw out the conventional concept of eating. \u00a0For example, we were given an earl grey infused pillow, not to sleep on, but for our lemon custard earl grey cookie dessert course to sit on, and as the pillow slowly deflated, it emitted the aroma of earl grey as you ate. \u00a0How cool is that?At times, we longingly eyeballed the other patrons who were doing the 24 course tour, who were presented with things like a giant log. \u00a0Umm, I want to eat whatever delicious morsels off a giant log!At the end of the meal, they present you with a menu in a big black envelope. \u00a0That was a nice keepsake and reminder of the most amazing meal I've had to date.There were 2 downsides to my once-in-a-lifetime experience. \u00a0First, I got chastised for taking pictures of my dishes. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Okay I understand it's kind of bothersome if you're using a flash but I turned off my flash and I told the woman that. \u00a0She said \"but your camera still gives off a light\". \u00a0Dude. \u00a0It's a red blinking light that most people's camera gives off if you don't use the flash, like the red recording light when you use a video camera. \u00a0Hey, we're dropping some big money here, it's not like I'm being a paparazzi and going flash crazy. \u00a0The table next to us had to leave early because the woman got drunk after her 5th course, couldn't eat anymore, was throwing her head on the table every 3 minutes and nearly stumbled down the stairs. \u00a0And they were frowning on me for taking pics even without a flash? \u00a0I'd say her demeanor in the nearly full room was much more distracting than my picture taking when it was nearly empty.Secondly, the staff was attentive, so painstakingly attentive that it was almost borderline uncomfortable. \u00a0We could see them lingering at their waiting area talking about other patrons (namely, drunk woman), and sometimes it felt like we were children at a library being observed by the librarian. Still, those two things did not detract from the experience that much, and I cannot speak highly enough of Chef Achatz's culinary creations. \u00a0The Alinea experience brings food and eating to a whole new level.", "Date": "2010-04-29", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Dkrejser S.", "ReviewID": "lVpY0i4vMb9PEbqcsKVwzQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reviews, the ratings and the difficulty getting a table definitely all were part of creating huge expectations. On the way we discussed if we might get really disappointed.But the experience was sublime!It started while entering through a pine forest were we played hide and seek. While waiting for my husband to turn over the car to valet our children and myself played hide and seek in this interesting entrance. When we got into the restaurant we were greeted by the kitchen entrance with a cup of pine infused hot chocolate.As we were going through our courses we were amazed by each dish - the emphasis on the flavors, ingredients and presentation was impeccable. And it was so much more than regular upscale french food - the presentation was interactive, different and well thought out.3 dishes in particular stood out - one with a thai inspired tom yum fried shrimp. Still can sense these flavors and longing to come back for it. The apple taffy helium balloon was really funny and interesting, but my youngest did pass out from it as I there thought he was faking but since have read up that his reaction to the helium is not uncommon. The chocolate frozen desert was was also one of my absolute favorite deserts and the biggest disappointment was that we couldn't possible finish that much desert. It was really something worth coming back for.Our only irritation of the evening was a group sitting behind us which was rather loud and thought they should take it upon themselves to entertain the rest of the dining room. It is such a shame when people haven't learned to contain themselves and show consideration for other patrons and respect for the food being served. When encountering such a group of people I wonder why some are so annoyed over children in a restaurant because our children have never been this loud, and they know how to eat with knife and fork, and they try everything that is brought to them.The service was so friendly and perfect. They knew to come at the right times and were very attentive. They even remarked a little spurt/splash/mini explosion from a hot dish that was being made at the table and immediately came and removed it and apologized. They then corrected the mistake by not serving the dish that way for the rest of the tables. Nothing had happened and we were fine but when the bill came they had complimented our drinks as an apology for the mistake.

Not only is each dish presented in a unique & beautiful way, turning food into art, but each dish tastes as good as it looks! \u00a0Not a single dish was disappointing. 5 stars to each and EVERY dish...only downside is that most of the courses are literally ONE bite. \u00a0So after eating that bite, you wish you had more to enjoy, but that's it....just ONE bite. \u00a0The meal is 22 courses, but you won't feel stuffed when you leave due to size of course. \u00a0We went in a group of 6 (max # they will take)..and the experience lasted 4 hours. \u00a0There are 2 sizes for wine pairings you can add ($160 additional, or $100 additional for 2/3 the pour of each wine). \u00a0It's too bad they don't have a non-alcoholic pairing. \u00a0They had this cranberry/pomegranate juice mix that was delicious...a little fizzy, a bit tart, but mostly sweet.This is the first restaurant I have been to without a sign! \u00a0I guess it's so well known that it doesn't need any more attention than it already has...so don't be surprised if you drive by a regular looking building. \u00a0Only sign with the restaurant name is the valet sign. \u00a0Reservation process: On the 1st of each month, phone lines open for booking 2 months later. \u00a0You will have to call and hang up repeatedly until you get through...and when you do, you'll be put on hold. \u00a0But..it's WORTH IT.Regarding the meal (see pics for each course): \u00a0No bread, no amuse busche. \u00a0Just start off with the first course and finish through. \u00a0Favorites: Mussel, razor clam, hot potato/cold potato, black truffle explosion, & yuba. \u00a0Some of the dishes are very playful...as in you \"play with your food.\" Others are displayed in a unique way, such as \"antennae,\" where the yellowtail snapper is hanging from a wire & you eat it without using hands. \u00a0\"Lemongrass\" looks like a mini-fishtank, or what reviews call food in a test-tube. \u00a0The ends are sealed with a jelly/ dragonfruit so the contents don't spill out. \u00a0You suck on it like a straw and everything (mostly liquid contents) fall into your mouth. \u00a0Lastly, there is a dessert finale where they plate the whole thing on your table (lined w/ silicon sheet). \u00a0Pay attention to the WHITE liquid! \u00a0Small detail you might miss if you aren't observant. \u00a0When they put this liquid on the table, it forms SQUARES, not circles like most liquids do!! \u00a0Super cool! \u00a0The chocolate mousse dipped in liquid nitrogen tastes better when it melts a little b/c it is similar to chocolate ice cream; in the beginning, it has more of a \"dry\" crunch taste. \u00a0It's also cool to watch them turn the banana cream liquid into creme brulee right in front of you.DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT SURPRISE SPOILERS regarding playing with food. \u00a0When we first sat down, our waiter brought us what he called \"centerpieces.\" \u00a0Looked like a little baby garden grown on a rock with soil. \u00a0He told us it was for decoration...and not to eat or touch it. \u00a0Later, this centerpiece actually became our salad! (They bring you a baby pair of scissors & u cut your own greens and place it in the bowl of dressing & tomatoes...which we originally thought was a soup). \u00a0I loved the element of surprise. \u00a0There is another dish (short rib) where you have to assemble the plate and add the ingredients to make your own giant ravioli. \u00a0(DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH SALT...i mistakenly added all of each ingredient..which is fine..but don't add all of the salt). \u00a0There is a dish called hot potato/cold potato, where there is a pin that holds a fried hot potato ball on it among other things...you pull the pin down and out, and the hot contents fall into the cold potato soup below it and you take the whole thing like a shot so you have the sensation of both temperatures in your mouth. Very cool. \u00a0Lastly, there's a dessert dish where there are different colored cubes which represent different flavors. \u00a0You get to choose, mix & match the cubes, to blend the flavors in your mouth. \u00a0Choose wisely, b/c not all combinations go well together..haha. \u00a0After reading this, I might have ruined the surprises, but it'll still be very fun. \u00a0Loved Alinea, loved the food, the service, the art, everything. \u00a0Will definitely return one day.", "Date": "2011-09-23", "Author_Location": "Monterey Park, CA"}, {"Author": "Scott K.", "ReviewID": "24613HLQke8Yk1eXYvESug", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alinea was probably the most memorable culinary experience I've had. \u00a0Probably not the greatest, but definitely the most exciting. \u00a0I'm definitely not the type who usually spends this kind of money on a meal, so I had high expectations, but I would say that Alinea delivered. \u00a0I've never had food where the total experience of eating was as well considered and nuanced. \u00a0As an architect I wish the fairly bland and corporate architecture of the space (despite the funny perspective of the entry hall and the nicely detailed staircase) reflected more of the playful, alien feel I identified in the food. \u00a0I felt like I should have been eating in something that looked like a felopian tube. \u00a0I wouldn't normally critique a restaurant on its architecture as some of the meals I've liked the best were served in buildings or strip malls only a few steps up from cardboard shacks, but Alinea isn't a \"normal\" restaurant. \u00a0I suppose they wanted to focus the attention on the food though. \u00a0That said, the experience of the actual food was ambitiously intended to be experienced with all five senses, and ultimately succeeded in delighting most of them. \u00a0They were also extremely conscientious about dietary restrictions, which actually surprised me in meals that involved so much prep work. \u00a0Two of the six us at the table don't eat land animals, and got substitutions of Japanese sea fish or lobster in dishes typically of beef etc. \u00a0 Unlike other reviewers, I felt that occasionally the meal did slip into ridiculous and goofy territory, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of it. \u00a0And I don't know if it's middle class guilt around service, but the attentiveness of the servers was somewhat creepy for me, though I'm sure most of their clients are used to it. \u00a0By the end of the over four hour meal I wished there was an \"opt-out\" clause in my culinary contract so I could push in my own chair and not have to get a new napkin every time I went to the bathroom (which was a LOT since I drink a lot of water, haha). \u00a0One of my later bathroom trips I jokingly attempted to fold my napkin so it would look new and the server would see it and think one of his coworkers had already given me a new napkin, but my friends said he came over, saw my napkin, laughed out loud, and put down a new one. \u00a0 The creepy attentiveness of the servers was offset by their friendliness, accessibility, and knowledge of the food. \u00a0And I think they liked us or could tell we were only barely out of college and couldn't really afford it, because they ended up not charging us for one of the six set menus! \u00a0That saved us like $200! \u00a0That's major points in my book, though I suppose that could be common practice. \u00a0Also, midway through the meal my eating buddy told me that when she ate at Per Se they charged $10 per teeny bottle of sparkling water, and since I had been guzzling it (you get thirsty over four hours of eating food chock full of weird salty foams and dehydrating chemicals!), I was terrified that my own water bill would be like $100+, but I think it was just like $8 or $10 per person. \u00a0What a relief, ha ha. \u00a0Overall, a fantastic experience and one I'd repeat; if \u00a0you're buying, anyway. \u00a0Ha.", "Date": "2007-12-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "tr y.", "ReviewID": "QLAi0X9ALAMBw8NorFHP9g", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "truly amazing food, FIVE STARS.... however the wine pairing was poorly explained and the lists should be printed out for review. \u00a0The Sommelier could have been nicer and should have explained that some wines were meant to last three courses. \u00a0 The Desert was improved over last years tobacco mint sundae. \u00a0This was the last time due to the Cryptic crappy wine pairing, lack of wine list \u00a0and weird wine pricing. \u00a0They should implement an ala carte wine pairing with actual prices per glass instead of a flat rate. \u00a0The wine was great but the way it was handled was so bad that it brings down my overall rating which is a shame because the rest of the place runs so smoothly..NEXT.", "Date": "2011-07-07", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "John W.

Alinea has received 3 Michelin stars and dozens of accolades.The Food: Our meal that we had consisted of 17 stunning and innovative courses finishing off with a big finale dessert prepared by non other than Chef Achatz himself right on the table. Not only is every course delicious but every dish was a different experience. Center pieces were used to present in the middle of the table to be saved for uses in a certain course. \u00a0I had a bunch of courses described in this review but i realized I didn't want to spoil it for foodies that haven't been here so I deleted it. Every course is a surprise on it's own. Even though I liked and was amazed by every course some of the course that I thought was just made me speechless was Hot Potato Cold Potato, Taste of the Ocean, Farm Salad, Peach and Black Truffle Explosion. Like I said I'm not going to spoil these course for you by describing them, you're going to have to experience it for yourself. \u00a0The Decor: \u00a0Very low key on the outside and not much to look at but once you step inside... Wow!! Stunning looking restaurant. Automatic doors slide open at the end of the \u00a0hallway after you open the front door. Once you step in you can see the very busy kitchen right behind the maitreid's podium. Very modern and chic. throughout the whole dining room.The Service: \u00a0Impeccable, One of the best services I've ever had in all my dining experiences. They made us feel very comfortable right from the start. All the servers that served our food did a great job of describing our dishes and teaching us on how to eat them. They were also very comedic at times when serving our dishes. It was fun. The best was when Chef came at the very end and chatted with us a little bit while he was \"painting\" our dessert. Everyone was so professional and nice.The Summary: \u00a0Definitely worth the experience and trip. The expert critics were right as to vote this place the number one restaurant in America.

I've been wanting to eat here since I read about it two years ago in some magazine. After many talks about possibly going to Chicago for this much awaited event, the opportunity finally arose for us to go and experience the much anticipated Alinea. We called a comfortable two months beforehand to set our reservation and were all set for a 9:30 pm dinner, just one day after we ate at another molecular gastronomy joint, Moto (review coming). We took a cab from out hotel to this fairly non-descript restaurant, almost missing it on the way. As you open the door, all you see is a thin corridor. As we walked forward hesitantly, the automatic metal door on the left opens to reveal the interior of this carefully thought out restaurant. \u00a0The pristine kitchen is on the right. You are able to peak in and see the chefs working their magic. We were seated upstairs, right next to a group of four that we saw the previous night at Moto. No recognition was exchanged, but crazy that we would see another group eating at these two restaurants back to back as well. There is no menu here, just a wine list. You are at the mercy of the chefs. What they create, you eat. We ordered the full tour menu, no allergies... we were ready to get this started. As the waiters deftly moved around the dining room, preparing their guests for their next entree, our waiter placed a small silver circular plate in front of each of us. We looked at it intently trying to figure out what to do with it. We didn't have long to wonder as the waiter placed a wire instrument with a vanilla bean in the center. These surprises would continue the rest of the night as we took our adventure on the Tour Menu:1- Steelhead Roe - coconut, cilantro, vanilla fragrance 2- Lemongrass - oyster, sesame, yuzu 3- Tomato - basil, mozzarella, olive oil 4- Cauliflower - five coatings, three gels, apple 5- Yuba - shrimp, miso, togarashi6- Chicken liver - bacon, caramelized onion, vin santo7- Watermelon - fresh coriander, tamari, bonito8- Oxalis pod - sweet, hot, sour, salty9- Short rib - guinness, peanut, fried broccoli10- Hot potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter11- Lamb - potato, sunflower, sweet spice12- Concord grape - yogurt, mint, long pepper13- Transparency - of raspberry, rose petal, yogurt14- Cobia - tobacco, radish, cedarwood15- Celery - pork belly, shiso, sudachi16- Alaskan king crab - popcorn, butter, curry17- Wagyu beef - maitake, smoked date, Blis Elixir18- Black truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan19- Duck - foie gras, mole flavors20- Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme21- Strawberry - violet, nicoise olive22- Dry shot - pineapple, rum, cilantro23- Pumpkin - gruyere, Blis maple syrup, smoke24- Chocolate - fig, olive, pine25- Dry caramel - saltMany hits and very few misses. I wouldn't even say miss, more like just not my taste. Everything looked beautiful and the service was spot on. My favorite dish of the night was the Hot Potato-Cold Potato. But the most beautiful dish of the night was the Short rib with guinness. I would love to return if I am ever back in Chicago. I think it blew away my dinner the previous night at Moto.

Loud conversation the entire night, none of it about the food: in fact the food seemed secondary to their goal of consuming as much alcohol as possible. All of George Carlin's dirty words were spoken - announced - out loud (OK, not C---sucker, but really and truly we heard the other six). They made poop jokes about the chocolate on the dessert table. Five cell phone calls rang and were answered in the middle of dinner. At some points the laughing and yelling rose to a fever pitch that was only broken up when one of the women at the table shushed the rest of them, only to explode into laughter herself. Chef Achatz himself came out to serve their chocolate splatter course (by the way, it's quite novel), and even this did not sober them up - they heckled him for being too young to be a real chef. We were just one course behind them, and my wife asked me if I thought Achatz would also come to our table. When I said to her, \"No, I don't - it's just not our night tonight,\" she knew exactly what I meant. (He didn't.)The thing is, we loved the food - it was maybe the best I've ever eaten. For the first time ever in my fine dining experience, there was no course, no bite, no flavor in the entire meal that I didn't like. There were flavors and spices and presentations I've never seen or imagined. Some of the ingredients were quite sophisticated, others simple but surprising (Granny Smith apple sorbet, English pea puree, and parmesan cheese... who thinks like that?) And actually the service was great: friendly, conversational, respectful: our sommelier didn't treat us like naifs when we asked simple questions about the wine pairing; our waiters had mastered the art of being simultaneously knowledgeable about, and in awe of, the complex techniques their chefs showed off from the kitchen.But eating is an experience that involves all of the senses, and one year from now when I think about this meal, the memory will be of scraping delicious frozen yuzu from an insane minus 200 degree ice cone, while the man at the table next to me is asking the waiter for a shout wipe because he has so covered himself in flakes of chocolate, followed by the staff asking him to get up while they replace the chair because his mess has stained it to the point of unusability. I'll remember biting into a masterpiece of exploding truffle, and also how funny it is that the woman at the table next to us sometimes acts JUST like her mother. I don't know if there was ambient music playing in the restaurant, but I do know that the woman next to us uses Bruno Mars as her cell phone ring tone. And I'll remember getting the check and, for the first time at a four star restaurant, feeling a little like a fool for spending so much money on one dinner.I've left some suspense about one thing: did I speak up to the diners? Did I tell the staff? Did they \"make it right\" (restaurant-speak for free stuff)? Here's the thing: there's no making it right. This is a restaurant full of talented staff who know how much it costs to eat there, and who should know how to deal with this situation, but didn't. The four diners next to us were never chastened - no subtle request to take phone calls outside, no gentle reminder to the jacketless man that jackets are required (I was reminded twice, once when I called for the reservation, and once when they called to confirm). It should not have been up to us to ask these four people to quiet down. And as the only couple sitting next to the group, I didn't feel comfortable complaining about them to the staff while they were still sitting there.I spoke to our waiter when the group had finally left, and he apologized on behalf of the restaurant, said all the servers knew they were trouble, and they could tell when they walked in that they were pretty drunk already. He said they talked in their meetings about how to handle people like that. And then he said, \"I wish you had said something sooner.\" I appreciate the sentiment, but it sounded like I didn't need to tell him. I wish they had acted sooner. Three hours into our meal, at about the same time that the offenders left, a couple was seated nearby to begin theirs.

In fact, I hadn't even heard about Alinea until a few months ago, and I never in a million years expected to find myself here, athough I've drooled over the yelp pictures quite a few times. So I was literally speechless when my boyfriend brought me here for a belated birthday dinner, making me the luckiest girl ever :)PROS: Everything, which is something that I rarely say. My expectations for Alinea were through the roof to begin with, and high expectations are rarely met, not to mention exceeded.1) Service - top notch. Humor/social-skills are definitely part of the servers' job description because everyone we encountered was personable and funny. They also seemed to have an innate sixth sense (or they were just eavesdropping constantly) because it was like they could tell when we needed to get up for the restroom. We even got a quick tour of the kitchen after our meal.2) Decor - stunning. It felt like we were in a museum and we were afraid to touch anything. I hope my future house will be this pretty. 3) Favorite dishes - I was trying to pick a single favorite but gave up.- Venison: interactive make-your-own wrap. I had no idea what venison was until my bf explained that it was deer :( It's super tasty though.- Apple: piece of breaded brie/apple/onion skewered by a cinnamon stick. I'm going to go burn cinnamon sticks for decorations now.- Scup: family-style olive salad, chickpea chips, mint sauce, and a WHOLE fish. We were confused by this course since it's completely different from Alinea's otherwise minimalist style. Loved the salad and chips, and the fish was very tender.- Dark Chocolate: pumpkin ice cream-filled dark chocolate pinata. I'm a fan of all things pumpkin so I'm almost required to love this. This was the last course and although I was bursting inside, I kept wanting another spoonful.- Notable courses: scallop shaped like tofu (what is this nonsense), a bunch of spoons with different items on each (flavors meant to complement one another), a squid dish named \"woolly pig\" (confusing name), an ice sculpture (which was actually a course), and peppermint snow sitting on really cold rocks (I accidentally touched the rocks, ow).CONS:- Oyster leaf tasted like a leaf to me...- Too much truffle. Which isn't really a complaint because that's like a kid complaining about too much sweets.- A few of the dishes sauces were a touch too saltyOverall, I'm thankful for an amazing experience.

\u00a0Well, the plating for one is a true experience at Alinea. \u00a0From the use of a vanilla bean as a utensil to the silicone dessert table, Chef Achatz uses many advanced techniques to prepare and serve the food but he does not lose the poetry in the food itself. \u00a0I appreciate how he keeps it simple in order for you to appreciate the food but when you dig into the actual dishes, you realize how much thought and preparation goes into each dish. \u00a0I love the carrot handroll with the tobacco extraction and short ribs that you had to make yourself. \u00a0My favorite dish was the cold pea soup but my wife's was the cold potato / hot potato truffle soup and the shrimp stick thing that had an amazing dipping sauce... \u00a0One thing I will say is that the wait staff was quite attentive but I found some of the more senior wait staff dry and in some ways, a bit too stiff. \u00a0Perhaps I am more of a casual person who likes to enjoy his food and the people he is surrounded by, so in that sense, I would say that I have had better service. \u00a0It's not that anyone was rude but I can't help but wonder if these people take themselves too seriously. \u00a0It's hard to explain but I would have appreciated a little less pretention and a bit more warmth. \u00a0That being said, some of the other waiters were also quite funny and nice, including a server who had just completed his 2 yr anniversary and had a pleasant personality. \u00a0We waited at the front after dinner as Chef Achatz was kind enough to show us the kitchen and the front of the house, specifically the tall female (I think her name was Mallory or Melanie) was fantastic. \u00a0She gave us a tour of the kitchen and helped make it even more memorable, like she understood that for many of us, dining here was a once in a lifetime experience. \u00a0Finally, I have read some reviews or blogs about Chef Achatz that dared to proclaim the chef as a prick. \u00a0To that food critic, you are an asshole and a pretentious contrarian who suffers from the exact problem that most food critics share... \u00a0someone who abuses his power to share his opinion and someone arrogant enough to think his opinion matters. \u00a0(Basically an article about a misunderstanding over a photo taken during the private viewing of Next and Aviary). \u00a0My wife and I couldn't find the Chef more charming and more humble, and I must say, meeting him and his demeanor made us that much more impressed with the meal. \u00a0This is a guy who beat cancer and during much of the time of his treatment, came to work every day. \u00a0This is a genius who is considered by many to be the finest chef in the USA who came to our table and painted our dessert for us. \u00a0This is a guy who thanked me for coming to eat at his establishment and who wanted to make sure our photo came out good. \u00a0Chef Achatz, if you ever come across this review, you are a revelation. \u00a0TWO WORDS: \u00a0MAN CRUSH", "Date": "2011-06-02", "Author_Location": "Sunnyvale, CA"}, {"Author": "Hannah H.", "ReviewID": "T45v0q1_dbYkDMAJCwoFwg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not know what to expect from this restaurant - I've heard that the restaurant itself looks like any other 'ordinary' building, without the name blazing about. They have valet, but you can find parking a few blocks away (non-permit). You enter the restaurant, and you walk down a short corridor that has purple lighting, and enter to your left. You are greeted by literally 5-7 men, dressed in suits, asking you the same question - 'How are you doing this evening?' We were seated in the dining area on the ground level, a booth with some comfortable cushions. The waitstaff seems very particular in the placement of your beverages, and cleans up with a damp towel of any morsel or droplet of liquid that gets on the surface of the table. I tried the Green Tea/Grapefruit/Lavender, which was like a grapefruit sparking soda, with a hint of ginger. My cousin had the Ginger Citrus, which tasted literally like a strong ginger ale beverage (definitely better than the one at Wow Bao's). We had the Tasting Menu, and I expected probably a small morsel of everything, but I was actually surprised with the amount that they give you for each plate. We first started off with the English Pea, and it tasted like green pea ice cream - slightly thick and creamy, and it was quite nice. The next was the Shad Roe, which tasted like a bacon tempura ball with a twig of bay leaves used as a skewer. The Distillation was a wine glass of Thai liquid, which was the least favorite of the dishes - it tasted like red pepper flakes with a hint of floral. The Pork Belly, which was my favorite of of them all, was in making your own spring roll with this rice paper that has beautiful little flowers within, and the restaurant presents you a glass platter of different ingredients that you build with - the braised pork was just delicious!!! The next dish we had was the Sturgeon, which were cubes of sturgeons with leek and croutons - great creamy sauce with smoked apple ribbon running across. Next was a cute little 3-part bowl with different tempered-Jonah Crab - it contained lobster mousse, king crab with crusted avocado, star anise bubble (which tasted creamy and black licorice-like). We had an offer of a glass of Sassporillo - really strong orange-colored root beer (not a fan of it). The next plate was the Filet de Boeuf, presented as a clock set-up, with little spoonfuls beef tongue (which was my absolute favorite since it was so awesome), duck was bleh, wagyu beef was kind of soft chewy, the panko too overly fried, the mushroom was just like a wet mushroom, cocksical (from the rooster) was gelatin-like - interesting experience. Next dish was the Duck, with cubes of duck with mushrooms, a cylindrical foie gras encrusted in dehydrated orange. Next was a spoonful of truffle ravioli - liquid 'explosion' of truffle inside. Next was the Earl Grey, the plate being set upon a fragrant Earl Grey pillow - the plate itself contained rounds of lemon curds with Earl Grey graham bits and a hint of rose water throughout. Next was a Chocolate dish, a trio of chocolate - chewy white bits, menthol, pudding, and several coral-like frozen chocolate at the end. As an extra treat, the restaurant gave us a ball of chocolate with melting cream (which was heavenly and good for the chocolate buffs). Our last dish was the Bubble Gum, which was a glass test tube-like filled with long pepper, hibiscus, and creme fraiche - I liked the bubble gum-flavored tapioca balls. The whole experience took about 3 hours, and be sure to ask the waitstaff if you could take a tour of the kitchen - it's cool to see a behind-the-scenes look at each of the carefully-made dish. You get a copy of the menu with explanations of the circles at the end of your meal as a 'souvenir.' Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to experience a restaurant that's rated as one of the top restaurants in the world, and the fact that it was located in Chicago!

I mean, hell, I even read Life on the Line (by Grant Achatz), and like I was saying, the highest expectations you could have for a restaurant, I had for Alinea. And without spoiling any of the surprises, I will say this was by far the best meal of my entire life. Every single thing you learn about food makes sense once you sit down at this meal.

I got 3 glasses of wine instead of the pairing and my friend got the wine pairing, but at the end of the meal we decided if we were to come back we would just buy a nice bottle of wine for $100 instead of doing the whole wine pairing thing, just because 1) you don't get that much wine (3 glasses total - 9 small pours), and 2) there's not really anything super extraordinary about the wine unless you guys are really REALLY knowledgeable about it. One thing I will say though, is maybe do a sparking wine during the first few courses, and then when the main meal comes out switch to a red wine. I believe they offer half bottles, so if you guys wanted to do two half bottles (one sparkling in the beginning, and 1 red in the middle) that would be a good option too. In my opinion, the reserve pairings are definitely not worth it because it is significantly pricier and you only get 3 different pours from the original 9, so my friends were disappointed when they chose that option.But all in all, a great fabulous meal that really brings out all of your senses, literally.

\u00a0My friend and I were trying to figure out how we could make these at home so we could watch the World Cup games and pop these little morsels of goodness into our mouths. \u00a0Super gourmet bar food is what it reminded us of.3. \u00a0Distillation of Thai Flavors - Least favorite (there has to be one). \u00a0Just weird. \u00a0They said is was a plate cleanser for the next dish, but I really don't think it added anything to the meal.4. \u00a0Pork Belly - Most favorite!! \u00a0So so so yummy. \u00a0I am not going to spoil the surprise for you, but trust that you will be pleasantly surprised. \u00a0i was raving so much about it I think my only-fish-eating friend considered trying it \u00a0:)5. \u00a0Sturgeon - Very good. \u00a0I haven't had a lot of sturgeon before this and I'm afraid to get it after this because I don't think it could ever be as good as this one was. \u00a0Super fresh. \u00a06. \u00a0King Crab - Served three ways. \u00a0Some better than others. \u00a0Texture was weird on one of them (like a pudding almost) which threw it off, but overall very good. \u00a07. \u00a0Lamb - Awesome! \u00a0The sauce was to die for and lamb was perfectly cooked. \u00a0Another one that I could have eaten an entire plate of.8. \u00a0Hot potato/Cold potato - I'm really not sre what all the fuss is about on this one. \u00a0It was just...ok. \u00a0I didn't get it i guess. \u00a0All I really tasted was truffles (which are great, don't get me wrong, but this isn't hot truffle/cold truffle). \u00a09. \u00a0Tournedo - Wagyu beef. \u00a0Outstanding. \u00a0Second-tied-for first-favorite dish. \u00a0It felt like it was melting in my mouth. \u00a0It's dishes like this that I REALLY don't understand how people are vegetarian. \u00a0THIS is why people eat red meat. \u00a010. \u00a0Earl grey - Loved the different textures and the combination of lemon and chocolate. \u00a0Very lemmony, but I like that sort of thing. \u00a0If you don't (like my husband) this will not be your favorite.11. \u00a0Chocolate - Cocunut, menthol, hyssop. \u00a0Definite menthol flavor, which was strange and tasty all at the same time. \u00a012. \u00a0Bubble gum. \u00a0- \u00a0So weird. \u00a0While a very cool way to the end the meal, \u00a0I wish it hadn't been the last flavor/texture in my mouth. \u00a0So, is Anthony Bourdain on to something when he talks about the tedious-ness of eating these tasting menus. \u00a0Maybe. \u00a0It does take a long time. \u00a0It could be difficult to sit there and carry on a conversation with someone always coming over to explain what your eating - but our friends and I managed to do it, we had an amazing time. \u00a0Also, I realize that Achatz is a food pioneer, in the vein of molecular gastronomy, but enough with the encapsulated things and gels! \u00a0There were too many. \u00a0Maybe I wasn't doing it right. \u00a0Good, but there were so many that i started to think that it was just too much, bordering on gimmicky. \u00a0But I would never say it was bad. \u00a0Or even close. \u00a0 Overall, you have to go to this place. \u00a0Yes it is expensive. \u00a0But I didn't cringe when I got the bill. \u00a0Because if ever there was a place that is worth the money, this is it. \u00a0You can see where your money is going. \u00a0This is not the kind of place you go to once a month, maybe more like once a year. \u00a0Or at least once in your life. \u00a0Save up the money and go.", "Date": "2010-07-21", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sonia L.", "ReviewID": "Uo7UwrL-Xi3grnsPWMUANg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I travel by myself often, but still frequent high-end restaurants in the U.S. and abroad. \u00a0I've even dined at a Guy Savoy establishment in Paris on NEW YEAR'S EVE by myself and been treated with respect and cordiality (and it was a great time with superb food). \u00a0 \u00a0However, I'll never be able to know what the food at Alinea is like as they do not accommodate single diners. \u00a0When I inquired about dining at Alinea via e-mail, I was told I had to buy two seats (\"you are actually purchasing a table...\" I was told). \u00a0I am appalled at this. \u00a0I don't feel anyone should have to pay extra just because they are single or are dining with an odd number of people. \u00a0Not even the great Joel Robuchon at his flagship establishment in Las Vegas or Daniel Boulud (at Daniel in NY) or Eleven Park Madison (or...or...or) \u00a0required me to \"purchase a table.\" \u00a0 Shame on Alinea!", "Date": "2013-06-04", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Kim T.", "ReviewID": "QVCS90PJ3ix2T0HzMZMzWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so I had to update my review to 5 stars because my signed menu came in the mail. \u00a0Chef Achatz didn't have to do that, but he did. \u00a0We are all good.", "Date": "2012-12-14", "Author_Location": "Tustin, CA"}, {"Author": "Matthew M.", "ReviewID": "yAV5HHCx8UkPiktErKMWiA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 130 reviews I believe yelp has gotten the point across that this is the best restaurant in Chicago. \u00a0Not only in Chicago, but a pinnacle for modern cooking. \u00a0I do not feel the need to explain the greatness of this establishment because so many already have. \u00a0I will just say that Alinea is one of the top dining experiences in my life and any diner would appreciate the art and the passion bleeding from this restaurant. \u00a0I believe eating here is like watching Picasso paint or Mozart play. \u00a0In years to come Chef Grant Achatz will be as important as Auguste Escoffier was to haute cuisine as Grant is to modern cooking.", "Date": "2008-05-30", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Kristine C.", "ReviewID": "CtEQUC8G4u_MRo1MIVthWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best tasting, most interesting, and interactive meals I've ever had.

Ever since I found out that the best restaurant in the U.S. was in my favorite city, I knew I needed to go. This was my third Michelin starred restaurant, but my first three star, and it did not disappoint. I found securing the reservations through the ticketing system to be quite simple, and am hoping other restaurants of this caliber switch to this method in the future. My night at Alinea was perfection from the moment it began- from the gentlemen helping me out of my cab, to the few minutes I got to spend watching the kitchen work, and of course the food and the service. I'm not going to write a review explaining the food, but I did enjoy every course. There were certainly some I preferred over others, but \u00a0nothing was bad or even close to bad. I agree with other reviewers that for several of the courses I wanted more than one bite, though I was definitely full at the end of the meal. My boyfriend and I did have the wine pairings with the dinner, and that is the only thing I regret. Neither of us are huge wine people, and therefore it was really too much wine for me. If I were to go again, I would probably do a bottle to share instead or try a few glasses from the pairing (if they do that, I did not ask). I did not love all 10 pairings, but enjoyed 9 of the 10. My favorite part of Alinea, besides the food of course, was admiring all of the beautiful pieces that were created to serve the food at this restaurant. Brilliant minds established this place, and everything about the design was perfect down to the smallest detail. I found the service to be excellent for my table, and all of the courses were well explained. We also had fun asking questions of the staff, and they had all sorts of fun stories and great laughs which added to our meal. I likely won't be back to Alinea, but only because it is cost prohibitive for me.

My overall impression is that while it was a very interesting evening and worth the experience, I wouldn't do it again. There was something about the experience that was slightly sadistic. The insistence by the staff (presumably this is coming from the chef) that so much be eaten a certain way and in a certain order was very controlling. You were punished with dirty looks if you didn't do it the right way. On top of that they played a came of \u00a0\"guess what this is\" with several of the dishes and wines. By the end I was purposely giving absurd answers just to see the reaction, which was typically kind of snotty.The point of controlling so much of the dinner seemed to be to craft a particular experience for the whole evening. It was all orchestrated. There was a clear arc and story to it. However, the peak of the experience was in the middle so the final courses, all after the savory courses, were a comparative let down. The sweet courses were a muddle and we left remembering those more than the peak. They were not memorable. I think that was intentional. It seemed they intended the high point to be in the middle, while you are the restaurant, not right before you left and went back to the outside world.

Last year she took me to Manresa (currently one of my favorite restaurants) for my birthday and this year it's Alinea. Yes, I have the best friend in the world that spoils me wayyyyy toooo much! I don't know how I'm going to outbeat this night when it's comes time for her birthday next year. We got there early and they happily seated us to our tables upstairs.

Tomato with basil, mozzarella, olive oil - tomatoes came in different forms (hydrogenated, jelly, etc) with a icy foamy mozzarella with cubed balsamic vingear jelly.3. Cauliflower with five coatings, three gels, apple - this is a seasonal dish. There were 5 custard like cauliflower cubes. \u00a0Each coated differently (parmasean, almonds, bacon, don't remember the rest). But you really have to use your palate to distinguish each one.4. Lobster with popcorn, butter, curry - yummy but a little too rich especially if you pop that butter balloon which my friend did =)5. Wagyu beef from Japan with maitake mushrooms, smoked date and Blis Elixir - this was my favorite. It was so flavorful that it kept me wanting more.6. ShortRib with Guiness, peanut and friend broccoli - this was a big dish and we were only half way through our menu. 7. Hot potato with cold potato, black truffle and butter chives - it was a generous portion of truffle. This was my friend's favorite dish.8. Lamb with potato, sunflower, sweet spice - whew, last of the savory dishes 9. Concord grape with yogurt, mint and long pepper - the big ball was in a shot glass which we had to open wide. The big ball cracks in your mouth and oozes out. My friend almost choked on this one. 10. Watermelon with fresh coriander, tamari and bonito11. Bacon with butterscotch, apple and thyme12. Pumpkin with gruyere, Blis maple syrup - this was cool. We ate this over a pillow of smoke so it's like your eating a smokey dish.13.

It would take several pages to cover all the dishes and wax poetically how incredible everything was - there are many previous reviewers who have done an excellent job at this. There is one dish, however, which I would like to highlight. At first I was sorely disappointed with the short rib pasta wrap. (and when I say \"sorely disappointed\" it's a relative scale. Anywhere else this would have been a 9.0+ out of 10.0). The short rib was very good, but I've actually had better. The pasta was quite tasty and I loved the texture. The user inspired additions were fascinating and challenging. With only one pasta wrap, unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of room to explore flavor combos. And this is what disappointed me about the dish. But as I continually thought about it the next day (now, that's a sign of an awesome experience), I considered that perhaps the whole point was a statement on the illusion of choice. The five people I dined with all essentially had the same dish and yet felt that we had personally taylored our experience. It was involvement without choice. Brilliant.A lot has been said about the price. So here is my $0.02. If you love food, a long evening out, and can afford / save for it, there is no question in my mind that the experience at Alinea is worth every penny.

Most nice places do- even a Morton's will ask you, and then print \"happy anniversary!\" on your menu. Nothing here. Like I said, I expected more. GT Fish and Oyster wished my husband a happy birthday when we arrived, and when we were seated, and then gave him a birthday gift before we left. THAT is service. Alinea could learn a thing or two.

My husband and I don't drink, and nobody pressured us to order something we didn't want. We did several of the house sodas which were tasty. The bottom line is that it really is an event to dine here- my husband liked it way more than I did- partly, I think, because he hadn't read all the info on the courses and was genuinely impressed by what came out.

after saying that we just wanted to do glasses/bottles instead of the entire pairing, the sommelier once again tried to tell us how worthwhile it was. i'm sure it is if i had thousands of dollars to spend all the time. otherwise, the service was pretty nice. i tend to ask a lot of questions about the food i'm eating but at alinea they like you to just experience the flavors without knowing exactly what you're eating. so they were nice about it but told me basically to stop asking.as for the food, while many of the courses were amazing, there were some misses. i guess i've just never been to this nice of a restaurant and disliked some of the food so much that i couldn't finish it. with 24 courses it's bound to happen but i was still surprised. my favs were the pork belly with iceberg lettuce, cucumber and thai distillation. this was exactly what i thought i would experience at alinea. really interesting, different than anything i'd had before and absolutely delicious. the other things i loved were the black truffle explosion and hot potato/cold potato. again, both were amazing, delicious and crazy. as for dessert, we got the silicone mat dessert and grant achatz himself artistically placed every item on the mat for us. i was totally startstruck and the dessert itself was awesome.the main dish that i didn't like was one that was several different versions of olives. i couldn't finish it. nothing about it tasted good to me. except for the silicone mat dessert, nothing else was a true dessert. we had several dishes that were savory and sweet. i'm all about savory/sweet combinations but some were just way too strange. i like to think i'm an adventurous eat but i felt like somethings such as the smoky peanut butter dessert (which really tasted partially like cigarette butts to me) were just not good.one other gripe. before leaving they gave me a copy of our menu and we asked grant achatz to sign it, which he did. i'm an idiot and left it in the cab

When the chef came to our table to put together the dessert he didn't look happy or excited at all but rather looked angry and not-interested.

It is a very different experience than a french laundry or per se given it is gastronomy but eat here once before you die or multiple if you are so lucky. It is truly differentiated in its service, food and creativity, Grant Achatz is one extremely gifted chef and a thought leader in a the arena of food worldwide. The only thing i will tell you about the food is that no matter what sample menu you see on websites or elsewhere, nothing tastes like it sounds, everything is an elaborate experience. They have also customized all their plates and cutlery to be fitted for all that they do. Call exactly 2 months before when they start taking reservations and get one at 6pm because you aren't going to leave before 9pm. If you have dietary restrictions, TELL THEM. They are very good about customizing your menu but you really do need to tell them in advance. Each dish is small so you will leave feeling satisfied without being stuffed, they have perfected this in a way i have seen no one else do. They will give you a copy of the menu when you leave with all that you ate. Service: they section off the restaurant so wait staffs of 8 (maybe less) are only serving 4 tables at once. \u00a0What this translates to is impeccable service. It is slightly creepy because there is always someone in the room if not 2-3 people so as soon as you are done with a dish, it is off your table before you know it. They also fill water so fast that my water glass never actually got below full. They clean the bathroom after each use. You are not allowed to use flash photography, i found this out by embarrassing myself so please don't do that. The servers are very quiet, they stare at you so you are not alone and you are aware of that but if you try to make conversation i found them to be pretty straight forward, they answer then disappear. I suppose that is just part of the experience where the focus is the food.I could tell you all that i ate but it is very difficult to explain in words so instead i'm uploading the pics i took and you can look at them which i is actually a much better way to try and understand what you'll be eating. Basically you taste things you never thought should go together \u00a0and flavors you have never had before.

So just a couple things to note - first, the service is a bit haughty at first, but they warm up quickly once they get a better feel for your table and your expectations (ours was, horror of horrors, to have fun). Second, the eternal question of wine strategy. We didn't do pairings, but instead ordered a couple bottles of wine after a champagne drink for the table. The sommelier and waiters shockingly push you into the pairings, but don't feel pressured and get a couple bottles if you prefer. Third, as for group size, I went with a party of six, which, while they were able to accomodate us, \u00a0I think might be just slightly too big. I might stick to a party of four on the high end. Fifth, I have semi-weird dining habits - pescetarian - (no meat, just fish/shellfish) and the adjustments they made were fantastic. Wooly Pig became Cucumber, and Lamb became Turbot. There were a couple other adjustments but they were so minute as to barely register.All in all, the \"old standby\" Alinea dishes - like black truffle explosion, and hot potato/cold potato - all delivered, and the newer ones were just superb.

Given the price, the staff to diner ration, etc. etc. these things could be improved.First, salt. There were two dishes (surf clam and and lamb) that had components that were burn-the-tongue salty. Seriously - burger king chicken sandwich levels of salt. In the case of the clam, when all the elements were mixed in one bite, it worked out okay. A number of other dishes were also at the too-high end of the salt spectrum, though not to that drastic of an extent.Which brings me to flavor. The problem with having too much salt is that it interferes with tasting anything besides the salt. In general, I think the focus here is on avant garde technique and beautiful presentation and flavor is neglected. There were a number of dishes - even those without salt problems - that tasted good, but not exceptionally good or interesting or unexpected. The earl grey cookies didn't really taste of anything at all, although that course worked as a whole.Wine pairing was hit and miss - for the first half of the tour, things didn't match so well for me, and some of the wines didn't work for me at all, but the second half was spot on (although it's possible that nothing pairs well with menthol)Finally, I wish that there was a restaurant in this class that was as creative with the front of house as it is with the food.

I am no chef, critic, or connoisseur and can only make the ranks of being a \"foodie\" in the most amateur sense of the word. My roadtrip to Chicago was just me tagging along with a friend and this privilege extended to a Dining Experience at this Formal Jacket Required establishment. And, yes, oh yes, was it an experience. From the get go, Alinea stands out in my memory because of its exceptionally unexceptional outward appearance. A slate colored, nearly-residential front with no name and dimly lit windows you cannot peer through. Going through the front door places you in a red-glowing, seemingly dead-end hallway. A timid venture inside surprises you with an automatic stainless steel door that zips aside for you to enter this new world. Everything here - the decor, place setting, service, taste, presentation - is immaculately precise and a fabrication worthy of reverie. FOOD // It's just beautiful. The menu is set, though I do believe there are 2 different options varying in number of courses. Passage of time and culinary ineptitude prevent me from reviewing the food itself. On a tastebud level, it was an enjoyable meal. There were a couple courses I did not care for and left unfinished, despite each course only being one or two bites (or slurp in the case of the tapioca pudding tube). The array of tastes and textures is vast and it doesn't stop there; courses intermingle with scent from a mysterious misty vase or an air pillow that releases aroma as the weight of your plate slowly deflates it. What entranced me the most was the architecture of each course. It is never simply food on a plate. Perfect cube of steak with micropackets of seasoning, strip of mapled bacon hanging from a wire, fragments suspended on pinheads, a landscape of roe. The dessert was an action painting of cream, gel\u00e9e, freeze-dried ganache, nuts, and syrup akin to Pollock with the duo team of chef-artists explaining along the way. Just amazing. I think Alinea should've made that the showstopping finale, but there were two additional, less exemplary sweet dishes. More bang for your buck?SERVICE // The level of service is equal to the size of the hole in your wallet dining here leaves. Table and chair pulled out for you every time, appropriate utensils switched and placed in specific orientation for every course, waiters that not only notice your actions but read your emotions. There was one snootier waiter who seemed disappointed in me (not the restaurant) when I did not finish a course. Another reviewer stated that the waiters will mirror your own attitude, but I was intimidated and overwhelmed more than anything else. I don't front, baby! Everyone else was great though. Special mention for the sommelier. I only drink to get drunk and my date does not imbibe at all, but I'm so glad our hosts did opt for the wine pairing. There were about 6 or 7 wines and each one came with an anecdote of origin and character the whole table could share. I wish every one of my meals could be served with a story. And the sommelier was a red-head with a certified afro. Love it. An experience I will remember forever, I recommend it for anyone in town who can afford it.

So the morning of our departure... we wake up late and miss our 6:30AM flight... okay let's not freak out... we'll standby hopefully we can get on the next one... 10am... nope, 12pm... nope...2pm...:(... 4pm... announcement \"next three flights to Chicago are canceled!!!!!\" WHAT!!! We have no choice but call the restaurant and cancel our special anniversary dinner :(... they are booked solid for the next three days that we'll be in town...we get a new flight for the next morning same time...and figure oh well maybe next time...

Lighting was dim and I almost didn't feel like I was in a restaurant but in someone's rich apartment loft. The noise level there was mild and toned down. \u00a0I was actually quite surprised how peaceful it was considering the restaurant was full. \u00a0I guess it was because all the tables were spread out into separate rooms. \u00a0In each room there were only 3 -4 tables and far apart from each other. \u00a0People were probably on their best behaviors too. \u00a0The Service was first class! \u00a0I felt like a celebrity. \u00a0Honestly it was like I had my own butler. \u00a0The gentleman who served us, (don't remember his name, but he had long dark curly hair) was always polite and treated us like kings. He was extremely knowledgeable on every dish. \u00a0How it was suppose to make you feel, what the food was made of, the history of that food, how to eat it to develop the best savor and what was the inspiration of that dish. \u00a0It was like watching an artist describe his masterpiece. \u00a0Some may not like people telling you how to eat your food. \u00a0But I didn't mind. \u00a0If you are spending this much $$$$ on your food, don't you want to experience it right to make your moneys worth? \u00a0You will never use the same utensils twice. \u00a0When I left to use the restroom, I threw my napkin on the table. \u00a0I came back to find my napkin folded neatly. \u00a0When there was a drop of sauce on my table, the waiter came right away to wipe it up for me. \u00a0The food was creative and so artistic. \u00a0You almost don't \u00a0want to eat it because it looked so beautiful. \u00a0I didn't even know some was edible.

I have dined at some of the best restaurants in America and in Europe. I can say without question that Alinea as a \"total package\" was the best restaurant I've ever been to and it was the best dining experience I ever had. As a restaurant, the design immediately puts you off balance when you enter the door and walk down an eerily quiet, narrow corridor in mauve hue and then suddenly to your surprise, like in a carnival funhouse, a sliding door quickly opens to reveal the front foyer. You immediately get a view of the bustling kitchen which is so clean it makes a hospital operating room look dirty. There is no separation between servers and chefs. All are hurrying in and out of the kitchen like worker bees on a mission. The decor of the restaurant is one like I've never seen before; multi-level and modular as if out of a geometry textbook or Frank Lloyd Wright unrealized blueprint. The service staff is a well oiled machine. There was not one misstep the whole night. The service was on the level of Pierre Gagnaire in Paris, like a ballet. Only, in Alinea's case, the catering was at a level inspired from love rather than obligation. We selected the lesser menu, but they honored a couple of requests that I made from the tour menu. Right out of culinary school Chef Grant Achatz studied at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry and then later at Ferran Adria's El Bulli in Spain. What makes Grant Achatz so great is that he has perfected the ability to completely marry the cutting edge molecular gastronomy school equally with the classic French technique making an end product that is an evolution to avant-haute cuisine. Ferran Adria of El Bulli tends to weigh more heavy on the technique and takes away from actually creating \"dishes\". Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 offers a more traditional preparation with an \"influence\" from the molecular school. Everything we tasted this night was undeniably \"food\"..not just a lab experiment that was unidentifiable by sight or smell. The juxtapositions of flavors were sheer genius and the presentations completely innovative unlike I had ever seen before.

few friends. \u00a0I love food. \u00a0I really love food. \u00a0I really, really, REALLY love food. \u00a0But I have shied away from the stratospherically expensive places because I have been let down one too many times. \u00a0At supposedly outstanding places, I've experienced missteps that convinced me that there is definitely a point of diminishing returns. \u00a0So, I tempered my expectations and figured that I would give this molecular gastronomy, modernist cuisine, or whatever label you would like to use, a try.This is not a relaxing place to eat, per se. \u00a0There is no music, the dining rooms are spare (probably because the food is truly the star of the show), and it's a little weird feeling that the staff is literally listening to everything we say and taking notes on it in a little black book. \u00a0Everyone was extremely friendly and professional, however, even when the flash on my camera went off accidentally. \u00a0I am generally a fan of warmer service, but I think this type of service matched the restaurant. \u00a0I heard from one of my friends that on his past visit, the servers were more interactive, so maybe we were just here on a slightly off night.The food itself was mind-blowing, inspiring, thought-provoking, and downright delicious. \u00a0So many reviews have already been written that I don't need to say much more. \u00a0I tried my best not to do much research beforehand to preserve the element of surprise, and I'm so glad I did. \u00a0The surprises are half the fun, for sure. \u00a0I loved the interactive food-as-art feel. \u00a0For the amount of ingenuity, creativity, and labor that goes into the food, I think that the nearly $200 price tag is actually a bargain. \u00a0Yes, a bargain. \u00a0Never thought I'd say that.Everyone at the table got the wine pairings, and while it was good, it may have been the most disappointing aspect of the meal for me. \u00a0I was hoping for the \"holy crap\" factor, that lightbulb moment when a food and a wine come together to produce a flavor greater than the sum of its parts. \u00a0I have experienced a few of these pairings before, some in restaurants, some happy accidents at home. \u00a0During this meal, I did not experience any of those moments, and if there's one place in the city I would expect one, it's here. \u00a0So, if I ever go back to Alinea, I'm not sure I would spring for the pairing again. \u00a0I may prefer to choose my own wine next time. \u00a0We did some research the next day, and pretty much all the bottles in the pairing are $40-$60 retail. \u00a0They were all good, but none were stunners. \u00a0For a table of 4-6 people, one could buy a few bottles of very good wine for significantly less than the 5 of us spent on the pairings. \u00a0Yes, you do pay for the variety, but I think we could get better wines picking out bottles with the help of a sommelier.Our party of 5 was there for 5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed every second. \u00a0I loved savoring the different flavors and textures of the components and taking my time picking things apart, then tasting different components together to see their interactions.Yes, it's very expensive, but if you are willing to

MEAL. EVER.We made reservations 3 months ago. \u00a0I saw how much it was going to cost, and it was going to be more than any meal I had ever eaten in my life. \u00a0And I had heard amazing things from everyone who had been here before me. \u00a0My expectations could NOT have been higher, and I'm VERY happy to say that I walked out even more satisfied than I could have imagined.Every dish was imaginative and creative, all featuring different ingredients -- very few of the components of the 20 dishes were repeats -- and a wide variety of preparations. \u00a0Many of the dishes had a whimsical feel to them, and the food runners all had a light sense of humor that kept the meal from being too stuffy, which you would expect from a place this fancy (JACKETS REQUIRED!!). \u00a0Only our sommelier was a bit too serious, but I guess that was understandable. \u00a0As an example of the whimsy, there was a big pumpkin sitting at our table when we got there. \u00a0When we were ready to start our meal, it looked like the waiter was taking the pumpkin off the table to make room for food, but when he lifted the pumpkin, there were four little squares of the most delicious pumpkin cake that I had ever had, with a bit of Thai chili for kick -- great way to start off our meal.That was followed my more and more delicious dishes, and there wasn't a clunker in the whole menu of 20 dishes! \u00a0My favorites were a razor clam appetizer with XO sauce, the mushrooms with red wine sauce (probably the best mushrooms I've ever had), a Sicilian \"swordfish wheel,\" and the famous \"Hot Potato, Cold Potato\" and black truffle explosion. \u00a0Some dishes were small, some were larger, but the meal had so many of the best bites of food I've ever eaten before.The meal ended as uniquely as it started. \u00a0The waiters came out and put a fancy, rubbery tablecloth on our wood table. \u00a0Then, two chefs came out with two coconut-sized spheres (made of chocolate) and steaming, halloween-like steins (filled with liquid nitrogen). \u00a0The two chefs poured the liquid nitrogen into the balls, and then followed that by covering the table with some mind-blowing fall-themed sauces -- a lingonberry sauce, a butternut squash syrup, and stout (or porter) reduction. \u00a0The chefs then picked up the balls and dropped them on the table, chocolate bits and random stuff inside the balls flying everywhere on the table. \u00a0It was like a frozen pinata, full of little treats like frozen french toast squares, nutmeg cotton candy, meringues, frozen cream cheese bits, and some other interesting, delicious bites that we dipped in all of the sauces. \u00a0We ate it all right off the table, mostly with our hands. \u00a0 The meal took four and a half hours, but felt perfectly paced with impeccable service. \u00a0We got the menus at the end, but I've debated many times whether I liked seeing the menu at the end, or whether I would've liked to have known what was coming. We had heard that there were 24 courses so we kept counting them, and didn't really know how many more savory dishes were coming before desserts. \u00a0Only two drawbacks on the night: (1) they don't have a full bar, so you can't have a cocktail before or during your meal, especially considering all of the amazing cocktails I've heard are served at Aviary; and (2) the wine pairing was a ridiculous $260 per person, which was even more than the meal. \u00a0While I love wine, I can't justify paying that much for a wine pairing, especially when the meal is already expensive. We did, however, enjoy two delicious bottles of red wine that the sommelier helped us pick out.

Something I don't need to experience a lot of times or even two perhaps. It is an experience that is unparalleled and unduplicated live and in the moment but not something I crave or want more of at all.The experience at Alinea preys on one of our most basic human weak points: anticipation. After you get surprised (I won't ruin it) the first time, you are constantly looking at the vessels put down in from of you before the actual food comes and you begin to wonder and guess what could be next. That is a unique part of the Alinea experience compared to ANY other place I have ever been to. \u00a0 The dining experience we all know well and can relate to consists of the acts of: seeing food, smelling food and then tasting food. (To Yelpers, there is one more: writing about food :-) SEEING \u00a0the food here is like no place else. The presentation may seem whimsical but probably could not be more thought out. Every dish is a piece of art unto itself. No two plates were the same and there is a conscious decision for none of them to be even similar. The custom tableware items are essentially \"serving canvases\". They are mediums to help enhance the presentation and are often an integral part of each course. Discussing them in depth here I think would take away part of the experience. Once again, the anticipation was one for the best parts of the meal so I will not go into detail here but I am sure other reviewers have. Just rest assured, you WILL be surprised and you WILL be impressed.The SMELLS of the courses at Alinea were like nowhere else I have ever been. Some of the smells they used did not come from anything that was actually consumed in that particular course. When was the last time or have you ever had someone tell you: \u00a0\"Here, smell this but you are not eating this. That is just for smell. This part over here, this is for eating.\"? You haven't. I haven't and 99.9% of the world hasn't. It's because it doesn't make any sense to us and we have never been forced to consider it...until a place like this comes along and shows you what the experience can be like.You will TASTE things here that you have never tasted before and you will taste things here in ways that you have never tasted them before. They are not traditionally slow cooking and developing flavors here. The chef has very specific tastes that he is trying to impart on the diners. Most of these tastes and some of these flavors, I have never experienced. \u00a0Every dish had multiple components. Some worked. Some didn't. Some had very specific instructions on how to eat them, others were specific that there weren't any instructions on how to eat them, which actually made those instructions specific. \u00a0After most courses, we shook are head in agreement that there was \"a lot going on there\" \u00a0or \"that was good\" but few courses left us wanting more of any particular dish even though some were only one bite. As far as a \"Dining Experience\" goes, Alinea is tops. If this where food is heading, it will be an interesting ride but part of the a conversation that we had was that this is the ULTIMATE gluttonous and selfish experience. You are not coming here because you are hungry, you are coming here because you want to be surprised, pleased & entertained. It gives new meaning to \"Dinner Theater\" .It is worth noting that while the service was impeccable and I do mean IMPECCABLE, there is a distinct lack of warmness and personal experience that you get at other similar caliber restaurants (Le Bernadin & Daniel). \u00a0We left realizing that no one ever asked us ONE question about ourselves besides \"Do you have any allergies?\". When have you ever been anywhere and them not ask you where you were from or if you were celebrating anything, etc... As much as Alinea exploits our basic weakness for anticipation, it neglects our more basic need to feel like we belong, are liked or are important. \u00a0None of which is the responsibility of a restaurant but why bother trying so hard with EVERYTHING ELSE just to let this not even be considered. Once again, you eat here for the experience. Having the diner feel like you actually care about them and their experience (which you are creating) \u00a0is just as important as anything else. \u00a0When you spend $700 on dinner, I don't care who you are, you wouldn't mind someone asking your name.There is an incredible amount of time and effort that goes into every presentation here and that alone is worth the price of admission. \u00a0However, for me, \u00a0\"Best Restaurant in America\", is somewhere I would want to eat in again.

For me it's all about two things, the food and the experience. \u00a0I can't even begin to give critiques about individual dishes as we've had over 40 now, but I'll say these few things in general:1). \u00a0It's experimental, there are hits and misses: the hit ratio for our two experiences was roughly 60-65% and we didn't always agree 2). \u00a0When it hits, you'll crave it forever and be left wanting more which I see as a good thing4). \u00a0the dishes illicit discussions of nostalgia and creativity 5). \u00a0The entrance is great, but the inside decor is too plain6). \u00a0You'll get to hear Achatz scream profanities at the staff from the kitchen at least once, and it's hysterical dinner entertainment (not to mention it highlights his commitment too quality and consistency)7). \u00a0It's whimsical and innovative...chill and don't expect large, rich classic french dishes8). \u00a0If you go more than once, expect a few repeats. \u00a0This would be fine had they been my favorites, but they seem to be the ones I don't care for. \u00a0Try and go during different seasons or you might see even more repeats.9). \u00a0I haven't been to Moto so as far as competing Chicago restaurants go, I don't know which is better.

There's a (no longer) recent review that actually highlights a lot of the cuisine that I sampled that night -- and sampling it was, as we went for the \"tour,\" which that night was a 26-course tasting menu that lasted five hours. It was worth the hype and every penny, however; it's simply a phenomenal place. Many courses were \"really good\" or better; the consistency was unexpectedly high throughout the entire meal. Perhaps my favorite course was squab in mushroom soup with foie gras foam, the extra details of which I could not recall at this moment I wrote the review up (it was simply too difficult to keep in my head; unlike moto, there are no printed menus from which to pull notes, and I didn't keep a notebook with me through dinner). I've been a fan of Grant Achatz's since his tour at Trio in Evanston; as seems to be the pattern (set perhaps by Rick Tramonto and Gale Gand when they went off to start Tru), a fair number of the highly-skilled waitstaff there were from the old days of Trio. Service was precise and elaborate; the room was modern and gorgeous -- the entryway is simply amazing in and of itself! Although the food did not peak at the levels that moto peaked at, I felt it was more consistent (though not due to a lack of experimentation and risk) and still ended up placing Alinea as one of the five best restaurants in Chicago today. (If you're looking for the other four in my highly-subjective, highly-opinionated, ephemeral list: Moto, the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carleton, Charlie Trotter's, and Les Nomades.)Yes, $175 is a hefty price for a tasting menu -- but what a tasting menu! It's also perfectly in line with the other new stellar greats in the US, such as per se in New York, and is in fact perhaps \"a deal\" when compared to Alain Ducasse's restaurant at the Essex House or many of the stunning French restaurants or Michelin three star restaurants out there.The bottom line? If you are a lover of exciting, dynamic, and post-modern cuisine (and live in the Chicagoland area) -- make a reservation (which you'll need to do well in advance) and go.The next spring, on April 5 (my little personal historical marker of terrestrial position with respect to the sun), we went back. That time was notable in two extra ways: first, I did the wine flight along with the tour; second, I got a copy of the menu to take home as a keepsake (a little thing I like to do sometimes -- call me sentimental, I guess). So I figured I'd just share the menu and review it as best as I could remember (bearing in mind that I was already up past my bedtime and was barely staying awake even as I type this), before too much time passed and I lost the thread of it entirely. I was far too tired that night to attempt such a herculean feat. Even with memory fading, it took all the free time I had over the course of two four days.[Yelp has a 5000 character limit, so I had to erase the dish-by-dish review from here.]In short, was this the best meal I had ever had? Absolutely not. I have had meals of pure perfection at Charlie Trotter's and Daniel's. Was this in the next level down? Absolutely. It's a great experience, with some stellar, amazing, wonderful, exceptional food, and some incredibly good dishes. (And one stinker that second time.) Was it worth the $175 tour price? Absolutely, if you're into the finest kind of dining adventure. Was the wine flight worth it? Yes, but only on special occasions (but then, I don't drink much any more anyway). In this case: absolutely. A memorable meal, a nice evening, a gorgeous room and building. Oh, and as opposed to last time: this one only took four hours. Record time!I could have written more, or found more links for the wines, or any number of things, but it had already taken a week, and I felt like if I take any more time, it might never get out.

One cannot put into words what a meal at Alinea is like. One can share pictures and attempt to describe the meal in words, but neither can convey the depth, artistry, and profundity that is Alinea. The entrance to the restaurant is unmarked, and when you enter for the first time, you may be surprised--I won't spoil it for you. Don't miss the tactile moving art structure. When you enter, you are immediately greeted by the hostess, who was very friendly. She asks for your name and then you are promptly seated. The restaurant's architecture is stunning: designed by Steve Rugo. Also of note is the interior design, especially the chairs which are the most comfortable restaurant chairs ever designed (Tom Stringer). I am jumping the gun here, but in the same category are the plates and implements (Martin Kastner). Part of the experience at Alinea is how the various sensory aspects of the place play off of one another, and the dishes and implements (avant-garde devices that deliver some of your food and off of which you eat some of the courses) add to the amazing experience. More on this aspect later.Alinea offers two price-fix menus: a 12 or so course called tasting and a 24 or so course called tour. Note that Alinea is not cheap, but ever penny is worth it, I guarantee it. You can find the prices and sample menus on their Web site (alinea-restaurant.com/in\u2026). A few things to note: because of it's popularity--it was, after all the top restaurant in the US voted by Gourmet Magazine, 2006--you need to have reservations a few months in advance, so do call. There is a dress code: men need jackets, though I wouldn't say the restaurant is at all stuffy. In an interview with the chef/owner Grant Achatz--who is quickly becoming one of the top chefs on the planet--I learned that Alinea strives to make the dining experience comfortable. So, as you are eating, especially if you feel intimated at first, just relax and prepare for a gourmet experience that you will never have anywhere else. Do you get the sense that I was taken with Alinea? Also, in terms of reservations, you can state any dietary restrictions: gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, fish, etc. So whatever you desire, they will accommodate that desire. Because you are eating on a fix menu I think the experience is even more profound. You don't have to make any choices, other than if you want the wine pairings and what type of water you would like to drink. Four paragraphs in and I am still on the water. This could be a longer review. How can one describe Alinea? It's not a culinary experience like any other. Some would call it \"molecular gastronomy,\" thought I read that Achatz doesn't like this term. Molecular gastro looks at the artistic, scientific, physical and chemical aspects of food and cooking, resulting in dishes and preparations that you have never had before. A classic example of this is looking at the effect of temperature on the egg. While cookbooks may discuss the key being the cooking time, molecular gastro reveals that the time is irrelevant--the temperature is the key, thus revealing the scientific aspect of the discipline. Harold McGee once described the idea of molecular gastro as \"The scientific study of deliciousness,\" and I think that is an apt way of looking at it. What makes this form of culinary artistry so special is that you cannot do it at home. Yes, you could use xanthan gum to thicken a sauce, but what Achatz and his team are up to is truly a scientific revolution of the kitchen. One example is an \"anti-griddle\" (cuisinetechnology.com/an\u2026) that takes food to -30 F. Pretty amazing! If you are interested in the technology, just search for molecular gastronomy on the Internet. Oh, the food!Yes, since the food is based on devices that you have never heard of or seen before, and since it is served on remarkable aesthetic devices, what would you expect. Basically, in a few words, it is as if you have never eaten before. After eating at Alinea I tried to compare it to ever other meal I could think of, and I could not. In culinary terms, Alinea is an undefined term: it simply stands on its own and it pushes all boundaries that can be previously tapped into the semiotic categories: \"food\" and \"restaurant.\" It is the culinary equivalent of Jacques Derrida's dismantling of philosophy and literary theory. It deconstructs everything that we have come to know about what goes into our mouth and then it reconstructs our senses at the table. We are told, not with a hammer to our heard as so many restaurants do to our taste, but with a whisper, \"Don't you wish that all food could be this way?\" I had heard from my college's culinary arts professor that Alinea has a guest-to-staff ratio of 15-1, or something like that, and I am still amazed that they can pull off every course and every bread pairing without flaw.", "Date": "2008-08-26", "Author_Location": "Carson City, NV"}, {"Author": "Til P.", "ReviewID": "gQUE-Ce7awaybII86iLfuA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I went on a Wednesday evening for the tour, yes all 26 dishes.While the food was generally good it was the experience that could not be beaten.

Why don't they sell those at Pottery Barn?? The aroma was heavenly.) Their allergy accommodations: they made delicious substitutions and were careful to understand exactly what I could and could not eat.The wine pairings: all the wines are unique and have an interesting story behind them. They don't seem to encourage it, but one tasting is probably enough for two.

Two doors slide open and like stepping into the Holodeck on the Enterprise you enter a entirely different environment than the one you just moments ago became accustomed to.I find it difficult calling what happened next a 'meal' as the term simply does not adequately describe an evening at Alinea. It was a perfectly-choreographed event with the story-line being the 18 or so courses laid out in front of us. The attention to detail is astounding, from the smallish separated dining rooms, to the many customized serving vessels, to the chairs that somehow remained comfortable for the duration of the 3 hours we spent there.All the dishes, many a single bite, were so rampant with flavors and textures that I took to pausing a few moments before swallowing to allow the flavors to mix and produce an entirely new element to the dish that I had not experienced just moments before. Taking things slow is a must here. Eat too quickly and you would miss out on the subtle flavors and additions offered by each ingredient.One recurring theme of many of the more substantial courses was that the whole was always greater than the sum of the parts. Flavors that maybe did not amaze on their own combined in a way that elevated all the components involved into one cohesive, unforgettable bite.Some courses were interactive without being annoying. Cutting my own greens off the \"living garden\" centerpiece for the salad course was a strangely satisfying experience. The salad itself was also unreasonably good.My only warning about this place is to have an open mind.

My husband and I don't eat pork, so we mentioned it ahead of time and they were sure to make a couple of adjustments for us. I also noticed that a woman nearby was a vegetarian, and for each course that included meat they would bring her something different. The service at Alinea was amazing. There seem to be more waiters than diners. One thing that I really appreciated was their occasional instructions on how to eat a course. Some courses are brought out in special serving dishes created just for Alinea. The food is presented in such an artistic way and some of the actual serving dishes are equally artistic. It's nice to have reassurance about how exactly you should eat a couple of the courses. \u00a0The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. I don't really want to ruin this surprise, but it's a gorgeous display of sweets on the table that is also super delicious!

"ReviewID": "XgiIPHVfI_iNyWBF7n89ag", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The four of us flew to Chicago from California one weekend for the express purpose of dining at Alinea. \u00a0 We opted for the 23 course \"tour\" menu.Every element of the dining experience at this restaurant is carefully considered, even your first steps into the restaurant. \u00a0When you enter the unmarked building, you step into a long disappearing corridor. \u00a0There is an automatic sliding door which surprises you near the end of the corridor. \u00a0The dcor is modern and minimalistic. \u00a0There is no tablecloth on the table, but as you will find out, there are many, many pillows that will show up throughout the dinner. \u00a0There are pillows for our bench seating. \u00a0There are little pillows upon which to rest your clean utensils. \u00a0There are even aromatic pillows that accompany a dish, releasing the fragrance of juniper as it slowly deflates sitting under the weight of the dish.Service is impeccable. \u00a0At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to our every need. \u00a0Our first course was a small, bite sized croquette. \u00a0When one of my dining partners and I joked that we were going to be disappointed if we needed to go out for steak after dinner, a waiter came by a minute later offering us bread. \u00a0When one of us started to fall behind in the 12 glass wine pairing, the sommelier started to pour less, and charged us proportionately less. \u00a0The dishes I loved the most were dishes that paired together interesting and contrasting tastes but were not overly fussed with. \u00a0 For example, the first course called \"croquette\" was a small croquette with cream and a garnish of steelhead roe. \u00a0I wasn't impressed with the idea of a croquette, but when you pop it into your mouth, the crunchy crust quickly gives way to an unexpectedly tender, creamy interior, shortly before the luscious oily roe pops over it all. \u00a0A good start.Our second course was called \"octopus\" and consisted of a thin slice of octopus stacked with shiso flowers and papaya. \u00a0A small bowl of broth made from soy beans accompanied it. \u00a0The combination of flavors and textures was delicious, and the broth chaser complemented the octopus well.The dishes that I did not love, and even disliked, usually involved ingredients that were overly processed to the point where the attempt to extract the essence of the flavor resulted more often in ill tasting artificialness. \u00a0It was like you were eating a purple grape flavored candy as opposed to a fresh grape. \u00a0The worst dish representing this was a dish called \"short rib,\" which included Guinness beer, peanuts and fried broccoli. \u00a0Now, I absolutely adore short ribs and beer, so how could anyone mess this up? \u00a0Here's how. \u00a0The chunk of short rib sat under a translucent, square thin gelatin sheet, presumably made of the Guinness. \u00a0Bits of peanut and burned broccoli were scattered about the dish, along with mustard seeds. \u00a0 What I love about beer is that refreshing, hoppy, cool liquid taste sliding down your throat, perhaps cleansing away the fatty short ribs you just ate. \u00a0Now take away the liquid, refreshing, tasty aspects of beer, and what you've got left is that gelatin sheet. The short rib lacked its usual rich, fatty, chewy texture and more resembled stewed meat. \u00a0Even the mustard seeds and burned broccoli had a monotonous, bitter taste. \u00a0Not all the dishes need to be great, but none of the dishes should be...bad.A disappointing surprise was that many of the dishes were over salted, killing whatever flavor was underneath. \u00a0For example, in a dish called \"hot potato,\" the warmth of the hot potato released the mouth watering aroma of a black truffle slice and contrasted nicely with the chill of a cold cream potato soup, but the whole dish was marred by the extreme saltiness of the soup. At first, we thought this was a fluke, but several dishes had the same problem. \u00a0On the plus side, all the meats, from the delicate seafood to the venison, were cooked perfectly. \u00a0Also, careful attention was paid to the texture of each element in the dishes, a dimension I find is often ignored in many restaurants. \u00a0Achatz' techniques show their strength in the desserts. \u00a0Almost a third of the courses could be considered desserts, which is more than I would have liked, but they all had interesting combination of tastes that worked well with each other. \u00a0I loved the bubble encapsulating sweet ginger liquid in one of the desserts, and I also loved the subtly flavored cube of shaved ice that contrasted with the creaminess of horchata pudding in another dessert.The wines we drank (One 12 glass wine pairing plus 2 bottles) were all good, though not remarkable. \u00a0The sommelier hinted as much when he mentioned that the wine was selected to complement the food, not dominate it. \u00a0Like the touristy dorks we are, we asked for Grant Achatz' autograph on our souvenir menu. \u00a0 He graciously complied for all four of us: \"Thank You, Grant.\" \u00a0Our total worked out to be $1200 before tip. \u00a0You're welcome.", "Date": "2007-02-20", "Author_Location": "Emeryville, CA"}, {"Author": "Michael H.", "ReviewID": "CgUK2a-AXSSoPJOcAxuRKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went in with high expecations, and they were exceeded. \u00a0Expensive as expected but all of the courses exceeded expectations and were fun.

The experience was fantastic and some of the dishes were amongst the best we've ever tastes. But...there is a but, at least for me. I guess we were not the first wine enthusiasts to visit Alinea and we found it very hard to get through to the Sommelier when asking about the wines. First of all the choices themselves were good, but not excellent (George Breuer Riesling is good but not good enough to be on the \"exclusive list\", same goes for Weinbach \"Clos du Capucins\") and the sommelier who also was our waiter was far from the friendliest person we've met.

\u00a0In a way, yes, but I wish it was just 2 or 3 spoonfuls more. \u00a0Although I left Alinea full so I guess it is planned this way on purpose. \u00a011th - Pheasant, green grape, shallot, burning leaf - the meat is on the end of a branch with leaves that smelled like they were likely burned. \u00a0This very pleasant perfume accompanies this tender, flavorful bite of the meat. \u00a012th - short rib, olive, red wine, blackberry - at the start of the meal, the staff drapes this orange thing that looks like a fruit rollup over two black things that look like chopsticks. \u00a0They tell you this is for later. \u00a0It's pasta - a ravioli sheet. \u00a0They give you a board with the above ingredients and some others like black garlic and salt. \u00a0You put it all into your ravioli. \u00a0So delicious. \u00a013th - hot potato cold potato, black truffle, butter - you get a little wax bowl with a pin in it that holds cold potato elements. You pull the pin from the bottom and it falls into the hot elements - quickly eat and savor the flavors. \u00a014th - pigeonneau - apparently its a very old classic dish executed exactly. \u00a0So just imagine a perfect flaky litttle tart crust with meat and cream and vegetable inside - small and wonderful. \u00a0Light, not heavy - but rich tasting. \u00a015th - black truffle explosion - you bite this package on the spoon and this wonderful flavor of truffle explodes in your mouth. \u00a0the desserts of bacon, carmel popcorn, earl grey and chocolate were fantastic but I didnt care for the whole bubblegum \"suck out of the tube\" exeprience. \u00a0Total damage with wine and tip and tax was around $1100. \u00a0Despite the muted overall experience, the food, the sommelier and being with my wife made it worth it. \u00a0Id most likely go back next time Im in town. \u00a0However, I might skip the wine pairing as it was a bit too much for us. \u00a0Not so much me, although I was pretty buzzed, but my wife had a head-ache next day", "Date": "2010-11-14", "Author_Location": "Fresh Meadows, NY"}, {"Author": "allison k.", "ReviewID": "vNKuK6HSWhIkPVgVzY9p0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Obviously the food is very interesting.

I was wrong. In short: Alinea's quality to price ratio just doesn't stand up but it is still extremely intriguing. Fun: yes; interesting: yes; worth it:...sadly, no; would I go back: ...more upsetting, yes.Note: I indicate some dishes here but am purposefully vague on most as I feel it is best to go into Alinea blind.Before going further, know that I was slighted early on when, four courses in, the server forgot to serve me. Yes. That's correct. After serving the other members of our party, the server left the table. Having heard about the service, I couldn't believe the misstep and assumed he was retreating to bring my course. Everyone at my table (3 others in total) were aghast and finally caught the eye of the main host who served me the dregs of the dish that had served the rest. There was no apology or much indication at all. The only indication, was a shrug of \"it happens\" by the server. So, understand that a bias existed early on.We did the tour and there were huge successes. The course I was slighted on being a major one: a pork belly dish that I could eat daily for a year or life. Also two \"soups\", one of Duck with morels and foie gras, and another of green garbanzo and mint (served with a fork full of entirely passable octopus). The Black Truffle explosion was fantastic. However, there were some misses that seemed to be correlated with the presentation. One being a venison course served very elaborately. Another was the final course, a chocolate and menthol \"dish\" served table side by none other then chef Grant Achatz. The menthol was intriguing but the chocolate missed the mark. The texture seemed to be lost to the presentation.I was surprised to find courses at Alinea limited to and occasionally negatively affected by the presentation. Two more courses along this line were a sugar cane dish and a three part lobster dish. The former was simply forgettable. The latter started off incredibly but went into absurdly average with bits of lobster that would have been forgettable except for the fact that I remember not liking the taste, and ended with a bisque that was interesting but perhaps too briny (one of our party was a vegetarian and everyone agreed that her bisque was much better than ours).Since there was a vegetarian in our group I should mention that Alinea typically rises to the occasion. I tasted some of the vegetarian dishes and they played with the same ideas as the regular tour. In some cases they were a step above (bisque mentioned previously). However, there were big misses as well, such as the duck and foie gras soup that was done, for her, with mushrooms and left her very much wanting.Everyone did a wine pairing and I upgraded to the reserve pairing. The wines overall were superb, especially a Ripasso served late in the meal and an interesting white which had been pressed with the skins (Radikon Oslavje 2004). Of note is that a lot of the wines were a bit sweet to pair with the courses - overall the courses being served currently tend towards sweet. I was happy to have paid for the reserve pairing as the wines which I \"avoided\" were a bit more acidic then I would have liked. I was happy right until the last wine poured: a 1976 tawny port. I don't typically drink 30+ year old port but I have had 30 year old port and I have loved the intense complicated flavor that comes from an aged vintage port. This was not such a port. It tasted like sherry with a slightly nutty aftertaste if one works past the extremely overpowering taste of alcohol. I was shocked but I was also helping finish off other desert wines and found great joy in a late harvest zinfandel from Dashe. So I set the port aside and tried to forget it. In the end I couldn't and commented to the main host who had been accommodating and entertaining other than the pork belly fiasco. The response was a polite indication that I was simply wrong. I wasn't asking for anything. I had already paid. If I was looking for anything it was a discussion of why I thought the port was off towards alcohol from any other aged port I have had. But I got nothing in return.I still feel that I need to justify 3 out of 5 stars. It simply comes down to the quality to price ratio. Two comparable restaurants that I have eaten are Minibar in DC and Don Alfonso 1890 in Sorrento, Italy. I had no problems at Minibar and the food and wine never missed as much as at Alinea (not mention the cost). At Don Alfonso, a fly landed in my wine glass.

Not just for my table, but for all of the tables in the room. We had our check paid within 2 1/2 hours--a bit too quick for what should have been a more leisurely meal. Definitely should have been a 3 hour meal. Also, after about the 5th course, I got tired/annoyed with the waiter telling me how to eat each course--\"do this/don't do this\". Really annoying was the captain who instructed us not to place the used flatware on the napkin since the napkin would be used later in the dinner; surprise: the napkin was eventually removed and never seen again. There was a plating on wet seaweed that was simply unappealing to look at although the tastes of the shellfish were good once dug out of the slimey seaweed. Absolutely hated the tastes of ginger--I've never been a big ginger fan, but after this course that were mere tastes of different very pungently-flavored ginger, I now rank ginger among my least favorite flavors (almost as bad as olives). I did love the truffle raviolo. I did enjoy the smoking pear dessert. Didn't care for the famous shattered white chocolate since I've never found white chocolate to have much flavor. The tasting of lamb that came with about 60 drops of flavor should have had a \"cheat sheet\" since I wasted the small bites in some less than stellar tastings--definitely would have liked to have known what I was tasting. The Miro spoons were very good. The best thing about the dinner was the excellent bottle of Robert Weil Auslese that I had selected.

We had some friends come in town from San Francisco and they were interested in going, so we thought we'd splurge as a special occasion to catch up with them. We were not disappointed! I was a little disappointed that we could only get a reservation for 6PM for our group because that seemed so early for dinner, but we did not leave until 10:30! It was an all night experience. We had the Tasting with the wine pairings. One of our group did not enjoy wine, but they were very accommodating and willing to do a pairing of other beverages for them to enjoy. We were a little nervous about only having the Tasting and not the Tour - thinking we would be hungry still at the end of the meal - but none of us were, including the guys! Not only was the size of what we ordered a concern for me, but I also opted for my meal to be vegetarian and I wasn't sure if anything would be lost in the experience - it most definitely was not! In fact, some of my dishes looked better than the meat eaters dishes! They were creative though and many of the dishes looked exactly the same with creative changes made. Some dishes were more successful than others, but we really appreciated the creativity and presentation of each course. We also enjoyed hearing about all our pairings with the wine. The staff was so helpful and FUN. Maybe it is because we were the youngest group in the restaurant, but they were not the least bit stuffy and they definitely had fun with us.I like the added touch of getting a copy of your menu at the end of the meal. It is great to remember what we had and as a little souvenir of your special evening. If I had any complaint it was about the book! I knew there was a book available, and I thought it would be a great gift for our friends and for my fiance. Online it said you could order and the Achatz would sign it... when I tried to order online I had no luck, so I called the restaurant. They told me the only way I could have the book signed was if I bought it when I was at dinner. I told them we had only just recently been to dinner there and asked if I could order the signed copy and pay for the shipping and they refused. I thought that was pretty ridiculous! You offer to sell the book online and don't have it set up, but when I offer to pay for shipping after dropping $1500 on a dinner you won't even allow me to pay for the shipping of a copy of the book? That left a bad taste in my mouth, but I ultimately ordered the books on Amazon for less $ and free shipping.... but no autograph :o(", "Date": "2008-12-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jade N.", "ReviewID": "tCMjmSdCN_USppNH3RlYtQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the most surreal experience dining at Alinea, beginning with the entrance to the restaurant.

I took my boyfriend for his birthday and we were amazed by the attention to detail each server provided. They were so precise with every movement we were initially a little on edge...did we belong here? My boyfriend made a comment about the white sauce on the plate only to realize it wasn't a sauce...it was the plate. The shiny, white, glistening plate that was clearly so perfect he mistook it for a sauce. I replied to the waiter that my bf wasn't used to seeing plates so clean and that immediately broke the ice...they liked us - they really liked us! The service was impeccable - down to a piece of bread which had somehow fallen from my plate to the table but was so unworthy of a hand to pick it up they came back with utensils to scoop it up and take it away! The first dish, by far one of my favorites, was the \"hot potato cold potato\" which has been spoken of in many other reviews. One single sip of soup with a tiny potato speared at the head of a pin along with a single piece of chive, butter, and cheese. So tiny but so delicious...a great start to a beautiful meal.

Everything else ranged between very good to \"this is the best thing I've ever tasted.\" Service was flawless. Very innovative, outside-the-box cooking; the best part about Alinea is that the extensive detail and culinary technique that goes into the dishes are designed partly to make you think about an experience food in a unique way, but more so to create flavors that are astonishing. I can't say the same of Moto, which was high on concept/creativity and somewhat absorbed with interest in novelty/technique/playing with food (e.g., all of the liquid nitrogen), but did not deliver flavors within the same league as Alinea (not even close).

I am torn about what to write for this review. Overall I enjoyed the experience, and I thought some of the dishes were absolutely hands down the most innovative food I have ever seen or tasted but I didn't leave there feeling completely blown away. Now, the only experience I have to compare is our visit to Per Se. While the techniques and presentation of these chefs could not be more different, I do think it's fair to compare and contrast ingredients used, atmosphere and service. I did the vegetarian menu and my husband did the standard tour. It was fascinating to see the Alinea's chef be able to play with each dish and make them aesthetically identical. His presentation was incredibly whimsical. However, for the price, which is $195 plus tax and gratuity, (which ends up being almost the same price at Per Se,) I didn't feel as if I got the same satisfaction out of the vegetarian menu as I did at Per Se. I feel that they should lower their price point for that menu. The standard tour, I unfortunately felt the same. No frois gras, lobster, caviar, sweet breads, or similarly rare and or pricier fishes or meats. With that said, the dishes were executed to perfection and everything tasted delicious with the exception of a consomm\u00e9 and custards that were simply over salted. The other thing that struck me, at Per Se there were SO many extra little courses and touches that weren't on the menu. An amuse, amazingly delicious bread course, pallet cleansers, cheeses, extra dessert courses, and a goodie bag of treats for each guest when you received your check. There were NO extra's here...not even a single piece of bread. Now, the atmosphere I found to be strange. I believe it's attempt was to be minimalistic, but it came off as very cold, and certainly, if I just ended up there without knowing anything about the place, I would never in a million years guess this was one of the world's top eating establishments. Now on to the staff....where to begin....I always try and remind \u00a0myself that when I leave NYC, I can't expect the same type of white glove service at high end restaurants. But, when you are paying over $200/person, all bets are off. Your staff, from the top down, should be professional, knowledgeable, and they should be an intricate part of the diner's experience. A place like Alinea and Per Se, isn't just about eating dinner, it's about having a food experience. We sat at 5:45 and you could hear a pin drop in our part of the dining room, that is, with the exception of the four staff members that stood in the corner watching us eat, and seemingly talking to each other about their guests. So for the first hour of our dinner, it was quite uncomfortable to only hear the chatter of the restaurant staff as well as having them stare at you while you eat. I don't think I have ever quite experienced that. The sommelier was horrific. We wanted to stay within the lower price range of their bottle list $50-$100 - he offered us no help once he realized he wasn't going to be able to sell us what he viewed as expensive bottles of wine. It was truly offensive. Because we love wine so much, I recall our experience with the sommelier at Per Se to be amusing and so enjoyable. He had a wonderful sense of humor; he brought us tastings and without even having to ask, pointed us to many different price rangers of bottles based on our flavor pallet. We never had to say what we wanted to spend after we ordered the first bottle, because he got it, he understood what price point we were going to be in and or around for that evening. The sommelier at Alinea's response to us when we asked him what he thought we should get after giving him a brief description of what we liked was \"Well...I don't really know, it just depends on what you like.\" What kind of response is that from a sommelier?? We were so taken aback and quite frankly that could have ruined our experience except for the fact that we know our wines and in all honesty didn't need his help. The food runners were all fantastic and one of the \"captains\" on the floor who was a short red headed young woman was fantastic as well. But again, not one staff member had the polish or the expertise that I feel is essential to working at an establishment that has received the kind of notoriety Alinea has. All in all, I don't regret going, it was such a unique and memorable food experience. Def go if you have the money to spend, but if you are looking for a meal that will leave you wanting to come back for more, my money is best spent at places run by Chef's like Thomas Keller, Daniel Bolud, Eric Ripert. After eating at Alinea, I confess, like my wine, I much prefer the old world rather than the new.

Every dish had a wow factor and the dessert was \"to die for.\" \u00a0Can't wait to visit Chicago again..", "Date": "2011-04-06", "Author_Location": "Rancho Palos Verdes, CA"}, {"Author": "Alex M.", "ReviewID": "hfCROYyTyVrUPQ1C75trDg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(btw - waiters are not rude - over the course of 4 hours we saw them go from professional and attentive to telling us stories of customers licking the table cloth for the dessert on the table! \u00a0they have a great sense of humor and dry wit - they are prob used to seeing stuffy / uptight customers so if you are real with them, they are real with you!)", "Date": "2011-07-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "Ud3xHfA2EP5BsmugEHwrhQ", "Name": "Alinea", "Price": "$$$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/alinea-chicago", "Longitude": " -87.64808290000000", "Address": "1723 N Halsted StChicago, IL 60614", "Latitude": " 41.913427400000003", "ImgURL": "//s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OChKeBfr6QnENC0ZiJjEOQ/90s.jpg"}}
