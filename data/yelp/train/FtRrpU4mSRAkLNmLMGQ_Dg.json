I heard about Little Goat from the chef at our cooking class and was eager to try it. I asked the waiter for help deciding, because I saw too many good things to easily pick one. It's a modern menu, so there's stuff you won't get elsewhere and the kind of decor that makes you want to redo your living room. A lot of people very much respect the chef. I had a milkshake and a hash of some kind (it's been a year so I'm surprised I remember even that, sorry).

Everyone else ordered from all over the menu ranging from breakfast-y stuff to more dinner-style entrees and everything looked great.The problem with the service, however, was two fold- First off, and this is a major pet peeve, you shouldn't need to be desperately trying to lock eyes with someone to refill drinks after everyone at your table has sat there for ten minutes with empty glasses. We rarely saw our waitress, to the point of it being awkward. When the food came out, it absolutely drizzled out from the kitchen, again making it pretty weird as everyone we were with politely waited as everyone finally got their food.So, as mentioned, great food... But service that was really lacking on a very basic level which really shouldn't be the case for how expensive it is. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe we were just there on an off night, but, still, really weird given the reputation of the Goat restaurants.", "Date": "2014-07-14", "Author_Location": "Aurora, IL"}, {"Author": "Lindsay M.", "ReviewID": "J99r3Dn4bI7Yq09AszzVRw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't get it.I'm going to have to agree to disagree with my fellow yelpers on this place. \u00a0I like the concept - it's a cute little diner with 'upscale' diner food. \u00a0However, it is simply overpriced for the quality.I have been here 3 times, and each time I feel like it gets worse. \u00a0For the most part, the food is very sub-par. \u00a0The food seems very unbalanced and each dish is either too rich, lacks in seasoning, or is just not good. \u00a0I'm really disappointed that this place is associated with Girl & the Goat - which is out of this world- I feel like this is the red headed step child. If you can't afford Girl & the Goat, or you just don't want to wait to get in, DO NOT think this is anything like it... it's just not.On top of not loving anything about the food... the service has always been very mediocre. \u00a0The servers always seem like they have something else on their mind and are partially listening to you. \u00a0My final complaint has to be the cocktails. \u00a0Total disappointment. \u00a0They have a menu of cute and classy cocktails- and then they get to your table and lack in taste and presentation (as they come out in plastic tumbler glasses- big no no).I hope that it's just me that's had 3 bad experiences, because otherwise I can't imagine this place sticking around for the long haul.", "Date": "2014-07-14", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Kirsten H.", "ReviewID": "4MheqBZyR4KsW6RKQLzxPg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We went here after a race about a month ago. The weather was nice enough to sit on the patio which was great. Our server was also great. I'd describe him as funny and casual with a side of helpful.

It made up for the so-so bloody. My friend and I both ordered the burrito and our other friend got the hash. All were great and satisfying. But in the end, for the amount we dropped on this meal I feel like it all should have been more amazing. It almost pains me to say this because I am a HUGE fan of The Girl and the Goat.

So the good ... the service was nice enough. Our water glasses and coffee mugs never went empty. The bread basket we started with was amazing. So soft and buttery. And the butter to go with the bread was perfect as well. Slightly sweetened so you don't need jam. Also the cinnamon roll was also amazing. It had cream cheese frosting, which is always a hit in my book. We got one for a table of 4, and we were fighting over the last scrapes of it. I also got a glass of orange juice. The Meh ... well I should start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of fusion food. And going into this meal, I didn't know that the little goat diner was going to be all fusion-y. So, especially when I'm hungry and just want diner style simple foods, this did not hit any spots. This also might be why I was in love with the breads that we started with. But I felt like most fusion food, it just tried too hard to be cool. I only had breakfast foods, so maybe the lunch items are better? But what they called kimchee was korean hot pepper paste. Whatever they called hosin sauce was cut too much with rice vinegar that it lost any of the sweet hosin taste.The Bad ... well there's nothing that's stand out bad. I know these are just so nit picky. But after eating at Girl and Goat a couple night before, this just felt like it should not be called anything Goat related. It was just a general disappointment of a meal outside of the breads and juice. I would come back if I was in the area, because it is one of the few none fast food breakfast in the area.

We asked the waitress about the taste, and she said that is just how it tastes because the hash browns are done one after another on the grill and the oil builds up. We could not eat more than 3/4 of it because the aftertaste (and during-taste) was that bad. Unfortunately, there was no offer to change it out for a different dish.

The menu is very unique so I would encourage others to enjoy the creations they offer you.-Beet Salad was very good, had a nice dressing and delicious avocado with it. One of the best salads I've had.-The ham frites were a standard raiser when it comes to fries/frites. Please if you love fries, order this for me and thank me later? They come with two sauces.

You mix it up and eat it, trust me it is good.-Finally the pig shank, very tender and then fried right before serving. Very good flavor and crunch too it, had two sauces that come with it as well.

It was so incredibly flavorful and delicious. My second experience was almost as good. This time I ordered the Parathas Burrito. I really can't put into words how great it was. My boyfriend thought the same and he loves eating animals. We ended with the Pb&j pie, which a super smart decision. I couldn't believe how they were able to fully capture the flavor of a Pb&j in the pie. I don't know how they did it but they did. All in all, if I could eat at Little Goat maybe once or twice a week I would.

Now I don't have a problem with the Ritz crackers, but with a in house bakery right in the building I kind of thought they could come up with something more interesting and homemade to dip into this hot dish of crab flavored goodness. The server brought plenty more crackers over to finish the dip without having to ask. I had my eye on the Breakfast Spaghetti, but they were out of one of the ingredients so they could not make it. I had the Springy Shrimp & Pork Belly instead. Basically a conjured up version of shrimp and pork lo mein. Both the pork belly and shrimp in the dish were cooked perfectly tender and juicy with the vegetables in the dish crisp and fresh. My friend had the Kalbi Beef Ribs with Thai fried rice, Beech mushrooms and crispy onions. the Korean style ribs were cook perfectly, again like the other dish, tender and juicy, the fried rice and crispy onions added nothing to the dish except for crunchy texture and making the dish have a appearance of brown on brown, on brown. The Thai fried rice was more like what you would get in the Korean dish dolsot bibimbap, with the rice having a golden brown and crisp texture from the stone bowl it is served in, typically Thai fried rice is more closely prepared to Chinese fried rice, but with Jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice, but with that said the dish was still good, just not what we had fabricated in our own heads.

We are admittedly fast consumers of diet coke but not demanding or impatient at all. I am not a regular diet coke drinker in the first place (although my partner is).

Not once. The attitude Wally had with our request for a refill was unnecessary, in our opinion. If we had ordered blander dishes, we'd likely order less colas, but we'd still be thirsty since our water supply for that hour was just one glass' worth.While the food and front service excelled, Wally's comment and his tone toward these two customers cost Stephanie Izard a deservedly perfect 5-star rating.

Another 5 minutes later he came by for the drink orders, and ran off before we could try to throw in our food order as well, because 15 \u00a0minutes with a menu is all the time a normal person requires. In the end the food saved the day and made it worth the visit. The bulls-eye french toast is an example of the creativity here, and I highly recommend it. In the future, an execution of common sense on the part of the hostesses could avoid frustration from customers and add to their overall experience. I felt like the waiter's level of service did not meet the high dollar tip he receives as a result of the prices here. Even at 18% he still makes off with a robbery, but I felt bad leaving less. As I said in my previous review, the food is good but the high prices prevent me from coming here as much as I would like.", "Date": "2014-05-12", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kelly C.", "ReviewID": "jfJa7YkKcH8MFl59wzLSOw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went for dinner on a Monday night and the place was packed! \u00a0Nice outdoor seating for the summer as well as an updated diner feel on the inside. \u00a0This place is in fact a diner serving diner food (in case you thought it was just Girl and the Goat but smaller). \u00a0It's an updated diner menu with \"new\" american classics including pork belly pancakes and kale salads in addition to an updated look at traditional classics such as burgers, milkshakes, and sandwiches. \u00a0While we came for dinner, I think it would be more aptly suited for lunch or breakfast (or for people who like to eat breakfast for dinner). \u00a0Great quality in the execution of each dish such that I thought what I ate was better than I expected from the menu. \u00a0Also of note, they have a gluten-free menu for those that need it.", "Date": "2014-06-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Carolyn C.", "ReviewID": "ya4jlFhnKRM2eRxFRy0A3g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been to Little Goat three times already, and each time has been delicious!

I am torn on an overall rating because I expected \u00a0a short rib type plate but the meat came in small slivers and still on a very thinly sliced bone. It was a little inconvenient to eat with such small bones (I am sure I swallowed at least one) but after I Googled today, that is how Kalbi is served.

While not too familiar with the area where my physical was being held, I found out the facility was just a short walk from Ogilvie Transportation Center. That being said, I searched Yelp for some Breakfast/Lunch type fare, and Little Goat piqued my interest.I was aware of the Girl and the Goat, but I did not know that there was a diner-style type restaurant that featured exactly what I was looking for. They also have a location in the Chicago French Market where they sell their 'daily bread.' It's also available for purchase at the diner. The diner is located across the street from the World Famous Girl and the Goat.I entered the restaurant around 12:30 PM. I was expecting it to be busy, and it was. They have outdoor seating, but I had no desire to wait, and being a solo diner, I was seated promptly at the diner counter.Being the meticulous fellow that I am, I scouted the menu before arriving to the diner. Unfortunately, I'm also very indecisive. I knew I wanted to eat at the Little Goat, but now I just had to figure out what.Before I arrived, I knew I was going to go with Pancakes or a Burger. I teetered about 7 times before making my decision. To clear my head, I decided to place an order for the Goat Chili. It came served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, jalepenos, and pizza 'poofs,' which were pizza flavored croutons, in essence. The chili was quite small in size, but it was my favorite part of the meal. I had never tried goat, but I could definitely tell the difference from beef. As usual with exotic meats, it was a bit gamier. I really enjoyed it. The jalepenos were a bit sweet, which I enjoyed, because I'm not a huge spicy guy. I like some kick, and these fit the bill.After devouring my six dollar chili (which couldn't have been a full cup), I was still debating on what to order. Breakfast was not out of the question at this point. Looking back on this moment, I wish I would have ordered one of their 'cereal killers.'My default rule at all diners is to order eggs, meat, and toast. \u00a0 My default rule at a pancake house is to order the omelette and pancakes. Since this was skewed towards a diner, I was going to order some farm fresh eggs, bacon, and toast for my meal, but I was intrigued by all the pancake options, especially the sourdough pancakes. I initially told my waitress that I wanted those, but then I became indecisive and withdrew the order. Looking back on it, I should have ordered those with a side of eggs and bacon.After two more minutes of debate, I ventured back to the burger menu. After sampling the goat chili, I decided on the Kilgus Goat burger, cooked medium. I had it done \"All American,\" which was simple lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, special sauce, and American Cheese. I had them hold the latter two ingredients, because I hate mayo, and every special sauce has mayo, and American cheese is okay, but I didn't feel like it would have made my burger any better. Just trying to be a bit health conscious! The All American came with a sesame seed bun, but I decided on the potato bun because I asked my waitress and she really did a poor job explaining the options to me. Oh well, the potato bun ended up better than the sesame seed bun would have been. \u00a0Along with my burger, I decided to order some of their sauteed vegetables. On the online menu, it stated sugar snap peas, but it actually ended up being sauteed vegetables, which featured mostly asparagus, radish slices, a small amount of peas, and it was topped with crispy onions. The veggies were very good. Just tender enough but not wilted. Kudos on those!As for the burger, I wasn't 'wowed,' but it certainly was not bad. The goat once again had a different taste from beef, and it was good. I wish there was something fantastic I could say about the burger, but I've had much better in the city (Bad Apple, Butcher and the Burger). It's my fault because I shouldn't order a burger at a place like this, and also I had a standard order, not one of their specialty burgers. For 14 dollars, I expected a bit more.Overall, the service was a bit slow. I understand it was lunch, but I had just fainted at my physical, and I was super thirsty, but my waitress only checked on my once after my food came, so I was a bit parched. My total ended up being 26 dollars. While I understand dining out in the city for lunch at a non-franchise place will be pricey, I felt I was charged a bit high.

I'm also interested to know what Izard's obsession is with Korean food (see: Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing). Because of the Izard brand, I've been here a few times. From the tasty thing to the grits to the french toast (but, uhh, not the cinnabun), everything tastes pretty good but is just drenched in salt.In any case, Little Goat's diner-style menu will set you back only an arm; if you want to lose the leg, too, try to score those Girl and the Goat reservations. The open, white-washed dining area is particularly nice on sunny days, especially contrasted to Little Goat's down the street corner neighbor, the much tastier Au Cheval. So it's definitely a nice stop to make when you're making the rounds with your tourist friends.

You couldn't tell the meat was goat and I felt that I could get the same flavor at any fast-food restaurant. The pancake was a savory mix of different Asian flavors.

On the Sunday that we were leaving, we also stopped off at the diner for breakfast after a night long of partying. It was the perfect end to our weekend. The mister went with the parathas burrito and I ordered the corned beef hash with egg & a side of grits. The burrito was like a breakfast burrito but had more veggies and fresh ingredients than what you could expect from McDonalds or any fast food joint. The arugula on top really won me over. Mine was divine too. I'm a big fan of corned beef and hash and although their interpretation wasn't really anything new, it was lucious and melt in your mouth delicious.

I went to LITTLE GOAT for brunch today, price range is around $25 per person. There was a short wait when we arrived at 11:30 A.M., thanks for the tip Kelsey Che , we get seated within 30 minutes. The atmosphere was trendy and classy, perfect for brunch. For entree, we ordered Brandade and Belly, and the BULL's eye french toast. Brandade and Belly, which served with brandade, pork belly, sunny side eggs, biscuit and kimchi. According to wikipedia, brandade is a dish consisting of salt cod mixed into olive oil and milk. This dish was very interesting and unique. It was similar to Benedict, maybe Korean one? haha The pork belly cooked perfectly and very juicy. It went well with Kimichi. Glad that I ordered it. For BULL's eye French toast, it caught my eyes which had eggs, CRISPY chicken, sweet onion brioche, and bbq maple syrup. The egg cooked perfectly with yolk once you cut through. You could taste egg, onion, chicken, syrup, and fresh strawberries all at once. It is a mixed favor with sweet and savory. It was absolutely delicious. Lastly, for the drink, \"THE LITTLE GOAT\", it is espresso, chai species and goat's milk. Also you will find the little goat logo is hidden inside the coffee cup, which it was very cute !

The fries were great, but the drink didn't taste like a mixed drink at all... it just tasted like sugary lemon water. Not even a hint of rosemary. A big bummer, especially considering it cost $10.The Korean burger also struck out. I was looking forward to the spiciness of the kimchi... but instead all I got was cold bacon/egg and kimchi that tasted like normal cabbage. The goat pattie was good but not too different from beef; it also had difficulty staying together as one coherent patty, meaning I had to go in with a fork to finish it. The bun was pretty banging, though!I had a sip of a smoked pork and toffee shake. It was alright (when it was served it definitely could have been a lot colder :/ ), but again, sort of flavorless. It tasted like a sweet milkshake that maybe was a tiny bit savory if I squinted hard enough. I did try some of the peppermint mattie, which was AWESOME. It was delicious chocolate ice cream with a spicy chili pepper aftertaste.... damn. I don't think I'll be headed here again, especially for a burger.

Delicious onion brioche bread with a baked egg in the middle, topped with barbecue maple syrup, strawberries...and the best part: fried chicken! It was a lot of savory and sweet in one plate which is ultimately my ideal plate. Also, I'm not usually a big French toast person but this dish won me over.My friend ordered the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing and we split both. Actually we wanted the shrimp and cheesy grits, but they were out :(If I had to choose two cons of this place, they would be 1. that they ran out of the shrimp and grits, and 2. (and this is super super nit picky), the table we sat at was in the light from the sunroof and there was a glare on me the whole time and I was sooo hot from the sun, even though it was freezing out.

We got a seat right away, which was great.The service was very good, and the waitress was very pleasant and quick.The food is kind of expensive (around $14 for breakfast entrees). We splurged and split the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup to start, and that was very tasty ($13 I think).We each got our own entree, too. Boyfriend got an eggs n bacon n pancakes kimchi thing. I got Brandade and Belly, which had pork belly and eggs and a biscuit and also kimchi.I think mine tasted better, but it was also crazy-salty. I only ate half, and I was very thirsty and didn't feel super after (remember I ate half of another entree too!).And finally, the place was very cute, but this one hipster ruined the atmosphere a bit my trying to get 'money shots' with his iPhone camera...you know, kneeling and crouching and getting in the way of the waitstaff.

This is my fave thing to order, always for a little southern comfort. Little Goat delivered a slightly upgraded version of B&G with pork sausage & mushroom gravy atop a flaky, buttery biscuit.- Fried pickles should be on your radar.

The brandade provides a oily, fatty, soft, melty that contrasts the spicy, slightly sweet, crisp kimchi that accompanies the tender, savory pork belly, all served with a runny, well-seasoned egg on top of flaky, warm biscuits.I've been here twice and had 8 different dishes, including many of the favorites: breakfast spaghetti, kimchee and bacon and eggs etc., bull's eye french toast, dark chocolate chip pancakes, and much more but the brandade and belly is hands down the best dish so far. I'll have to try the fat elvis waffles the next time I visit.On a side note, the hash browns are delectable. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and just the right amount of cheese.

The scallion pancake that everything rested on tasted a bit weird. It was a bit too thick, so I didn't get the light, puffy consistency that I was expecting. There was also way too much salt in the pancake.The fish tostadas were amazing though! Crispy skin enclosed over some extremely soft and tender meat. The goat burger was also good, but didn't really stand out from any of their other burgers. It basically tasted like a smokier beef burger. I didn't get to try these, but my friends also raved about the All American and Los Drowned.

However, the combination of some of the worst service I've ever experienced, an extremely loud environment, and meh food does not allow me to give a higher rating. I waited almost a week to write this review so I could calm down and write a fair review.First, we made a reservation for 7:00 PM. We arrived around 6:55, notified the hostess we were there, and she informed us we would need to wait at least 20 minutes if we didn't want to sit at a communal table. What was the purpose of the reservation?! This was a frustrating way to begin the evening. We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant- a booth next to the hostess stand at the end of the row. First, there is a clear panel that separates it from the table next to it, which was extremely distracting, but I can get over it. What I can't get over is the fact that EVERY staff member who walked by bashed into or slapped the back of my bench, which was extremely disruptive to my meal. Seriously, if you get seated here, ask them to seat you anywhere else- even the counter!Our waiter was totally absent. After we ordered, he was just nowhere to be found. It took us about 15 minutes to track him down to order a second drink (by the way, we ordered entrees, small plates, and booze, so he was in for a potentially good tip if he just provided minimum service). After ordering it, it took him 10 minutes to deliver it, and I seriously considered telling him I no longer wanted it. He did not offer us a dessert menu, and ran away before we could ask for one. Fine. It took us TWENTY minutes to get him to come back to the table in order to get the check. We had to ask the hostess for help finding him, and he couldn't even make eye contact when he finally returned with it. It took at least ten minutes to get him to process it and come back. In his defense, he looked busy, but if he had mentioned to us that he had a lot of tables or that someone had called in, we would have cut him more slack- \u00a0it was his attitude in combination with the long wait times that was just unacceptable.I would consider returning to try something else, but I would sit at the counter, and go as soon as they open.

In the process, I've tried several of the main stays on the menu in addition to the seasonal items and variations--I feel confident that I have a good grasp of the menu as a result. To be fair, there are always one or two stand-out dishes or drinks, but the overall dining experience is consistently flat, even mediocre.I'll give you a few examples of the \"bad\" for good measure:-Fried Chicken: Strangely enough, the fried chicken smelled and tasted like an old refrigerator. I know that sounds harsh, but I'm not trying to be. The chicken literally had the stale-stinky-sweet smell of an industrial refrigerator. The breading wasn't properly seasoned and thus, lacked the hallmark buttery-fatty flavor of real, southern-style fried chicken. The breading also fell off the meat of the chicken a little too easily. The mashed potatoes that came on the side were excellent, however.-Tempura Mashed Potatoes: Sounds good doesn't it? Imagine my disappointment when the final product resembled a cold, stiff assemblage of paste. The mashed potatoes were so thick, they were hardly edible. They stuck to the back of my throat and refused to be swallowed. The tempura exterior was stale, wet and also, strangely odiferous. -Hot Crab Dip: I love crab dip, I love salty things. This was too salty. Even for me. I enjoyed it for a few bites, but within a few minutes I began to feel parched and I could no longer taste anything else. -Another unforgivable item: The music they play at this venue is awful; Pearl Jam, Journey, Kansas, Meat Loaf. It's like one college-bro anthem after another. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?To be fair, the cocktails, salads and the BLT sandwich they served during the warmer months were always pretty great.It's not my favorite and I certainly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone I was trying to impress.

Very, very strong broth made from goat meat, and the pork and vegetables took on that flavor as well as inputted their natural flavors into the dish as well. Very well done.The tempura mashed potatoes are bad. It's just a croquette of potato basically, and mine came out to oily to the point that i had to eat around the crunchy exterior.

The ordering and getting your coffee process was so confusing. There were 3-5 employees constantly walking around in between and behind 2 bars facing each other, and none seemed to be doing anything.

OK, valet the car, go inside and wait.Fast forward 25 minutes, we finally ask the hostess what the story is, and she explains \"well, people are just hanging out, it'll probably be another 20-30 minutes.\" Wow...sooo....that's at least 5 times the wait you originally promised, plus, did you not think to factor in a pre-event crowd when you started giving wait times? The valet was smart enough to ask if we were headed to the game, so why should you be surprised at the fact that people were on a schedule? All of this while there were multiple clumps of 4 seats available - we weren't waiting for a private table, just anything available. Also worth mentioning that they don't take reservations, so it isn't as if we could have avoided this simply by calling ahead.Kind of disgusted, and out of time, we had to go, we'll just eat at the arena. We asked the hostess to validate the valet ticket, since we hadn't eaten and had been misled, and she was aghast - as if they should never have to do that.

Credible. Savory, shrimpy, with a little bit of heat, seafood stock, braised pistachios, Brussels sprouts leaves, stewed tomatoes, scallions. Unprentious, shockingly flavorful comfort food. The Reuben, with smoked corned beef, kimchi, saurkraut, cheese, and yellow mustard on pretzel rye was really something. The kimchi is a great addition to a traditional-ish reuben, and it's ridiculously delicious.We had the side of Glazed Root Vegetables (parsnips and carrots), which were fine but not exciting, especially compared to everything else we had.The seasonal cocktail, Fall in a Cup, was disappointing, but that was after drinks at The Aviary, so it was probably not a fair assessment. It was too sweet for me.The Cheez-It Sundae (Cheez-It elato, strawberry quick ice cream, chocolate/peanut butter covered Cheez-Its, peanut caramel sauce, whipped cream, and, of course, a cherry) received mixed reviews at our table.

Lucky for us, we went late enough that we only had a few minutes to wait before being shown to a nice, comfy booth that fit the five of us quite nicely. The wallpaper that covers the walls inside reminds me of something my grandmother once had, and the entire place had a somewhat cozy, homey feel to it.I had a really hard time finding just one thing that sounded good on the menu, so I took a recommendation from a friend and had the scallion pancake with pork belly and bok choy. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I felt there was too much bok choy on top and not enough pork belly. The pancake was excellent though! I was torn between brussel sprouts with almonds and roasted root veggies as my side (everything is served ala carte) and the server recommended the sprouts. Good.. yes, but I think I might have enjoyed the root veggies a little more. I felt most of the flavor from the sprouts came from the salt I added to them, not from the sprouts themselves. In my opinion, this wasn't the best meal we had over our weekend getaway, but it was nice to try a new place out that was off the beaten path for tourists.

We wound up ordering fried pickles and onions instead as an app. I really loved how hot the appetizer was and how light-tasting the batter was. The two sauces they had with it (tartar, maybe, and some house-made mustard which was SUPER mild) went really well with the pickles and onions. I especially appreciated that they pickled the onions too because I am not a huge huge fan of onion rings. There was a lot of acidity going on in that app though, so if that's not your thing, don't order it.My friend ordered the Los Drowned sandwich which he polished off completely, and I had the Brandade and Belly. I really loved how the flavors and textures of the dish played off each other. I never would've thought brandade + biscuit + pork belly + kimchi would taste good together, but they do. There is a lot of acidity as well, so I didn't finish my food (but I wrapped it up for a snack later!). The brandade was super unique and I really liked the sunny side up eggs. The biscuits were a little dense for my taste, but then again I'm from NC, so. Cute cute diner with some pretty unique food. Everything was cooked perfectly, so no complaints about that!

I was sitting on my couch late at night when my head started itching. At first, no big deal. I hadn't washed my hair for an extended and undisclosed number of days, it's probably just, you know, build up or whatever. So I continue to sit there and I'm working, typing away when this little thing glides into my frame of sight and then disappears. Maybe a fuzzball? A Gnat? I swat the air once as a precaution and get back to work. *Maybe* 8 seconds later, I see the spot again, only it's swinging... because it's a motherf*cking spider! Trying to eat my face. And it's so close to my melon that I don't even have time to freak out. I just start clapping both my hands into the air in hopes of nabbing it and smooshing it to death. And because I believe I was brought into this world to be a natural born (spider) killer, I succeeded. Dead as a f*cking doornail. ... But then... Arachnophobia. 2013. Starring Candice G. John Goodman is nowhere to be seen. It's all up to me. And there's about a million (like 4 or 5) little spiders coming down from the AC vent above my head. F*ck. Obviously those little f*ckers just got borned in there and I don't know if generic Target brand Lysol is strong enough to kill them all. And I have no idea how many are already nesting in my weave. Now I have to move. You can't undo that. Am I going have to disclose this incident to the next renters? What happens next? Where is my life going? I gotta get out of here. Gotta get outta this town. Far away. Far, far away... sort of like Jenny from Forest Gump. Far and away... but with less Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman. Off to the city, where there are no spiders, (that's a thing, right) but there are goats. Little ones. And one in particular always knows how to cheer me up. Makes me feel warm. and safe. and at home... but sans spiders. So I make my way to Little Goat, which is a haul for me coming from the suburbs, but it fits both my main criteria of being far away from my apparently insect-ridden apartment and it's spider-free, to my knowledge. It's not home, but it feels like home. Better than home at this point, actually. Now, I've done this LG dance a few times so I'm pretty well-versed in what I NEED to order... brace yourself, it's a lot, but keep in mind that I'd just been through a very traumatic experience and eating my feelings was necessary. Get this: * Crispy Shrimp Cocktail - somen noodle wrapped shrimp, cocktail sauce, lettuce wraps. Best thing on the menu. Hands down. * Hot Crab Dip - served with regular ole Ritz crackers, not house-made anything, but the Ritz are perfect and there's so much crab that you won't bat an eyelash at the price. Totally reasonable.* Shrimp and Cheesy Grits - insanely good, very filling* Smoked Fries - meat-free, but tastes like meat in the best possible way and the bowl is huge.* House-made veggie burger with the Korean set - kimchi, bacon, egg, spicy mayo, squish squash roll... but I get it sans bacon.* Veggie Chap Chae - spring onion, patty pan squash, fennel, tomato, sheep's milk cheese, cashews. It's like a pasta-y thing, but it's super fresh, farm-y and full of veggies and queso.* Choco Taco dessert. Heaven in a float glass. Okay, okay... I'll admit it. I've had a dining partner with me on every one of my visits so I've technically split all this and I don't actually have the manly appetite that I've led you to believe I have.

Regardless, we were able to get drinks at our table in the diner. We also tried the crab dip with Ritz crackers. That was a little disappointing because even though it tasted like crab, it contained no visible crab pieces. For me, it was too creamy and smooth and there was too much of it to finish, even for two. The entrees were pretty interesting and ranged from some pretty standard sounding breakfast fare (served all day!) and other entrees. The mac and cheese looked good but we didn't get that side. We both ordered the whitefish tostadas, which were really excellent. You get three of them, with very big pieces of firm, grilled (or maybe baked) fish, atop crispy tostadas which I am sure are not good for you, but were really tasty. The seasoning was perfect with harissa adding a kiss of heat. We didn't try dessert but it looked like they have some fun choices, including milkshakes, with a heavy emphasis on chocolate.

Although that might sound very precious, it was delicious. And normally I put the disclaimer that pork belly is cheating... but frankly the dish was lick-the-plate good before I even hit a bit of the pork.My wife's pork belly pancakes (yes, I know we went pb crazy) were fantastic. Basically it is an asian-style scallion pancake that is traditionally married with savory foods and it too was piled-high with kimchi slaw. It was also wonderful. The kimchi for both dishes wasn't super authentic in that it was neither very sour nor spicy, but it was tasty nonetheless.We also tried the smoked bacon and toffee milkshake, and it was quite good. We were considering bringing a vegan friend here and expressed concern to the waiter, who immediately returned with an entire Vegan menu -- unexpected for a place with so much meat goodness; the items looked good and they had some interesting things like the scallions and kimchi pancakes which was basically my wife's dish minus the meat -- keep in mind both our dishes were delicious even independent of the pork belly.As a side note, we've been to three restaurants by Top Chef contestants (in this case Stephanie Izzard) -- two of which we discovered to be the case after the fact.

Pork belly was buried in a plethora of pickled veggies with the most perfect balance of hoison sauce. It wasn't overwhelming to any of the other flavors, including the subtle scallion tones of the crispy pancake. I did not care for the Los Drowned. The braised beef had a thick line of fat through it. I didn't find it all that tender. It was a little messy to eat and I couldn't taste much of the avocado, but I did get a lot of the roasted pepper flavor. Might have to say, maybe too much.

It was a french dip sandwich at it's core, but Stephanie Izzard-ded to a new level (what the HELL do they put in that au jus!?) - undeniably the best french dip I've ever eaten and in the running for my Top 5 Sandwiches of All Time.

I have not figured out if the pork was braised, steamed or baked. Anyway it was so tasty with shredded cabbage and crispy noodles. The grilled Scallion pancake was the perfect wrap for those. The very light touch of housin sauce was just right. This should be a perfect oriental dish but I have not seen anything like this at any Asian place I tried. Absolutely delicious. Pulled Chicken with pita was pretty good but not as impressive as the Pork Belly.

We started with a couple cocktails which, while tasty, were scantly portioned and thus overpriced.

Fried pickles and onion rings melted in the mouth with an airy texture and light crispness, pairing beautifully with accompanying curry mayo and house ranch. The pork belly pancake could've used more scallions, but was nonetheless intensely flavored with bitter bok choy slaw, crisp-tender pork belly, and hoisin sauce tying everything together. My bulls-eye French toast tasted revelatory, balancing the sweetness of strawberries and smoky barbecue syrup with eggy brioche, crispy fried chicken, and rich, runny eggs. The dish brought an ideal combination of sweet-savory flavors and textures.The damage per plate was reasonable given the quantity and quality; I saw nothing over $20 on the menu. The atmosphere furthermore deserves a mention, low-fuss but very chic. The next door bakery/bar/coffee shop is a nice touch with plenty of tempting baked/caffeinated options.

SERVICE: First off, the waitress rushed me through my oder, and once everyone was done ordering, I asked her if I could add one more thing and she told me, \"only if you do it quickly.\" I couldn't figure out why she would say that...was such a bizarre thing to say to a customer. I also had to flag her down several times (via other staff) to refill drinks, water, get bill, etc. as she would just dissappear throughout our time there.FOOD: The Beef All American Burger is sensational! It is typically made perfectly with an extremely yummy sauce, although this last visit, I ordered it well done and it came back medium (pink and red). While I understand that mistakes happen and so I sent it back (they apologiezed for inconvenience and took the burger off the bill), unfortunately, we were with a party of 5 and everyone finished their entrees by the time I received my meal. However, everyone in our party really enjoyed their food and commented on how delicious every single thing was. AMBIANCE: Love decor and diner feel. Extremely loud, so definitely not a place to go for intimate conversation.Overall, great place with excellent food.

I went to Little Goat Diner for brunch and found that it has a slightly different interpretation of breakfast than what I am used to. This may or may not appeal to you. When I go out for breakfast, I like to see creative, and innovative items, yet I still want to have plentiful selections of more traditional breakfast dishes (with a twist). Little Goat has few \"traditional\" items, and has reinvented breakfast - which for some could be a good thing, but for me, it's a bit too fussy. \u00a0I will say that they do have more traditional items when it comes to sweet breakfast items like pancakes and french toast. As a savory breakfast lover (eggs, omelets), there wasn't much of a selection that I was interested in tasting. The one omelette that I was interested in was sold out, so I opted for the \"Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing\" \u00a0- it was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again. It just didn't satisfy my breakfast craving for more of an egg-based dish. My friend ended up making her own omelet, which she enjoyed, but I like there to be more omelet selections that were designed by the chef vs. me trying to piece something together, hoping that it tastes good. This place was incredibly popular - I came in around 11:30am on a Saturday and had a SOLID one hour wait. I was getting hungry so went over to the bakery section and got a muffin and tea, which was very helpful, as I was starting to get \"hangry\" (so hungry that you start to get angry). \u00a0The bakery area is a very nice touch.

Also very good if you feel like experimenting.Ok so normally I'm not a fan of restaurants that make you order a side via a la carte. However, the main dishes were so large that it was completely unnecessary for each person to get a side. The four of us split the smoked fries as a side. Oh wow, they were so scrumptious. I kept going back for more even though I was full.We ordered the tostadas, pulled goat sandwich, and japchae as our main. They were all very good. The japchae was a bit strange in flavor compared to the more traditional japchaes I've had.

We were told our party of three would have to wait but in reality a nice super large booth was available immediately and we were seated with no wait. The host was very nice and the room looks great. However we waited 5 minutes before even having water poured and another three to five minutes to have the waiter arrive. Yes, this is a casual spot but I think 10 minutes to be acknowledged is simply too long. The waiter was also very nice but I think it is clear the wait staff is over worked. Basically we needed to wait too long for everything and were never offered refills on our drinks nor had our water glasses refilled. These are just bad lapses in service that drag down the experience. The food is generally fine but not great... It's middle of the road. The Tonkatsu is huge but did not blow us away. Their version of a BLT (with avocado) in fact had almost no avocado but the bacon was good and it's also large. For some odd reason the soak the bread with oil or butter or something that adds nothing but grease and mess. The burgers are average, fries are pretty good.

Also luckily, my girlfriend doesn't like seafood and loves breakfast food, so the Little Goat fit perfectly for our needs. We arrived early on a Saturday morning at a little after 8am and almost got a table immediately. Quickly after we were seated though a line started forming at the door.We sampled a variety of things from the menu, even the non breakfast ones. Such as the Smoke Pork and Toffee Milkshake. For those who think this sounds weird... there isn't actually chunks of pork in it, and the toffee sort of overwhelms the taste and texture of the shake. The smoked pork is more of a subtle thing. It was yummy, though not as unique as I had hoped but definitely packs a lot of toffee.Soon after my Sloppy Goat sandwich arrived and I devoured it. It was big, sloppy, flavourful, and the roll was nice and squishy. I would agree with other reviewers that it is on the salty side. If you don't like salty food you won't love it... If you love sloppy joes you will love it... I loved it.Next my girlfriend's Smoked Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs arrived. The best part of this dish was the texture of the hash. Loved that the potato was shredded nice and thin, almost like little strings. Coupled with the smoked corn beef, and the fatty yolk... It definitely was a forkful of heaven.And lastly, what I consider the best part of the meal, and perhaps one of the best things I ate on my trip to Chicago was the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. The maple syrup was infused with the spice and the salt of the chorizo, which elevated something as amazing as maple syrup into something even grander. Having that poured on top of nice fluffy crumpets, and some gooseberries on the side for tartness to balance the sweet maple syrup was out of this world good. It really was the perfect dish.

carte/small-plates style, but in a diner atmosphere, which is confusing. \u00a0Basically instead of ordering a burger w/fries, you pay $14 for your burger + $4 for your fries. \u00a0You could also

American comfort foods with a gentle Korean twist.We started with $6 bowl of tomato apple soup, which tastes like a slightly sweet tomato soup. \u00a0Meh. \u00a0Next we had the pork belly pancake, which is awesome, except for the pork belly part. \u00a0The fluffy scallion pancake is full of flavor and holds up well to the very dressed sweet-tangy slaw on top of it. \u00a0The pork belly was a big slab of salty soft meat, but the flavors in it were lacking. \u00a0Just salty and soft.We also had the salmon-pork belly salad, which had kale and winter greens and maybe celery or fennel in it, as well as red onion. \u00a0I listed all the things because the salad tasted completely homogenous: the dressing overwhelmed all the flavors, including the salty pork belly bits (which acted like croutons) and the bland salmon and even the bite of red onions. \u00a0Tamarind dressing, and I love tamarind (Vietnamese hot and sour soup, anyone?) but ugh.It took us a very, very long time to find our server, Matt, and get our check, and it also took a long time for him to go run our credit cards. \u00a0We and the couple next to us spent a while just looking at him as he chatted with a table of 8 while holding our credit cards. \u00a0There are a LOT of people who work at Little Goat: the bakery next door bakes all the bread for the diner, for sale, and for Girl and the Goat, and there's a bartender and several baristas, and hostesses, and busboys, and chefs. \u00a0It's only been open for a little over 4 months, but they need to work on their communication. \u00a0We got our food after both parties next to us, who were seated after us (this is OK, the place is busy) but no one seemed to know who had ordered what. \u00a0Some dishes came out twice- i.e. the couple next to us had a sandwich delivered, then a few minutes later, a copy of that sandwich appeared which no one had ordered. \u00a0Meanwhile the other half of the couple was sitting and waiting for his meal for a long time. \u00a0Our soup went to them first, and we got someone's burger (which looked quite good).We'll be back (mostly because he wants to go back) to try other dishes, and hopefully bump up a few

And the inside is bright and airy with an enormous copper-beamed skylight in the middle and big communal tables and a lovely counter bar that features those sexy Edison bulbs in big glass domes overhead. It's well designed and for a place that manages to squeeze a LOT of people inside it - it doesn't feel cramped.And then there's the actual Little Goat branding - which is so cute and well done that I could throw up. The logo is adorable and EVERYWHERE. It's on the windows and the plates and the coffee cups and the to go bags and everywhere without being overwhelming. Again, this place gets some serious design points.My server was lovely and I wish I could remember her name but she was dark-haired and had glasses was attentive and helpful. Homegirl gets five stars, easy.The part that brings it down to 3 stars instead of 5 is, sadly, the food.I know, I know. I'm just as sad to type that as you are to read it.I ordered what's called \"Bull's Eye French Toast\" - which is basically \"egg in a basket\" only with bomb ass sweet onion brioche with an egg cooked in it. Served with it is fried chicken and bbq maple syrup and gooseberries. So it's basically a combination of chicken & waffles, french toast, and egg in a basket - all of which are totally lovely things. So I had some reasonably high expectations.Only when I cut into the toast, expecting a runny yolk - I got a whole runny, raw egg. And when I say \"raw\" I mean - \"the whites were still clear because they had not been cooked\". So now I have a plate full of raw egg and syrup and french toast that I'm suddenly super wary about eating because it's covered in raw egg.And it was something like, $15.Add another $2 for coffee and a tip and I just paid $22 for coffee and french toast with super uncooked eggs.The Little Goat is, before it's a Stephanie Izard restaurant, a restaurant.And what's more, it's a DINER.When cooks at a diner can't make eggs, something is not right.That said, I will go back.

It's a huge sandwich though, so exercise caution as it's pretty rich.Nachos - again, the best I've ever had. Tortillas are nicely fried, and the pork, beans, and cheese on top make it very tasty.

A lighter-tasting item on the menu, which is welcome given that most items on the menu are pretty heavy.Pork Belly Pancake - pretty good. Heavy on asian ingredients (such as hoisin, bok choy), making it pretty different from the rest of the menu. Shepherd's Pie - no longer on current menu. Meat base consisted of goat, beef, and pork. Decent, very filling, though ultimately not very interesting.Pork Baked Beans - competes for the best I've had. I'm a huge fan of good baked beans, and these are nice and tangy and the pork taste really comes across (bacon and drippings from the pig face dish at sister restaurant Girl and the Goat).

I think some of the employees were managers or investors or something. After all, today is only their third day of being open!We ordered coffee, two Bloody Mary's, biscuits and gravy (both large and small), scrambled eggs, sausage, and grits (totaling $63 before tip). The coffee was really good and tasted like Intelligentsia but wasn't. The Bloody Mary's were okay but we've definitely had better ones. I thought the sausage was the most amazing thing there - it tasted like bacon and I LOVE bacon. M and I both gobbled down the grits. We liked the biscuits and gravy (the biscuits were sweet and the gravy was savory) but we probably wouldn't get it again. My sister didn't say anything about her eggs.There was a short wait for a table by the time we paid our bill (about 10:00 AM). We were satiated and ready to concede our table to the next guests. After all, we wanted to check out the bakery/gift shop area! There was a small caf\u00e9 bar, bakery, and gift shop adjoined to the restaurant. We saw jams, spice rubs, shirts, and mugs. We bought two travel mugs ($10 each) and some maple syrup ($25).We definitely want to go again just so that we can try more menu items.

Although it was good, I have a feeling it's not their best on their menu.- Scallion pork belly sandwich: Same as the asian style kimchi thing. Good but probably won't order again.- Apple pancake with oatmeal crumble: Delicious. What's special about it is that it seems to have either curry or cumin added. An unexpected surprise. I really loved this but my bf was weirded out by the cuminy taste in a sweet pancake.- Benedict: So fricken amazing. Get it.- Hash browns w/goat cheese: Get it only if you know you like goat cheese. - Crumpets: SO good. Soft and dense on the inside. Delicious.- Service: slow but the server was nice.

Looking back I totally wish I'd ordered the Waffles! The French Toast (yelp.com/biz_photos/litt\u2026) tried to do the sweet & savory mix (which I usually LOVE) but something was just off about the taste - It was overpoweringly sweet. The first bite was good... then I just started to feel sick with how much maple syrup was drenched all over. I wish I could've taken a bite of the sweet french toast, and then taken a bite of the savory chicken, but everything on the plate just tasted like one flavor - the syrup.Besides that, my friend ordered the Blueberry Pie with Goat Cheese Gelato (yelp.com/biz_photos/litt\u2026), which I liked. It tasted very fresh and I loved the pie crust (well, I actually just love pie crust in general!) - the goat cheese gelato was delicious and pleasantly lighter than I expected.While I didn't like my dish THIS time, I think Little Goat deserves another chance though, so I'll definitely come back to try other dishes (I have my eyes set on the Pork Belly Pancake and Fat Elvis Waffles!)

It's got like a retro/mod diner appeal to it and you can definitely see rustic elements that you would also find while dining at Girl & the Goat. There's something on the menu that can please anyone's palette I believe. Little Goat is kind of like a bourgeosie Denny's haha (& i don't mean that in a bad way, because I love me some \"moons over my hammy\").i would definitely recommend trying the Crab Dip that comes with Ritz crackers, it's so cheesy and gooey and super fatty. just the way i like it. Also would recommend trying the cheesy french bread, especially since they make all of the bread in house. (bread is the reason they opened Little Goat all together after all) First time I went with the bf and tried the Supper Club Fried Chicken. The skin was fried to perfection and the chicken was super moist and tasty. The skin also had a hint of heat to it, like some hot sauce in the seasoning but it was delish. next time I went I ordered the Tonkatsu sammich and it did not dissapoint! I love tonkatsu sandwiches and Little Goat's version was SUPER DELICIOUS. Loved the combination with cabbage and pickled banana peppers. being the fatty that I am I also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was also super tasty. Not overly cheesy and didn't have an overbearing amount of truffle oil either. I tried the tomato apple soup which was also good, but the only comment I would have on that is that I didn't really taste any apple in the soup. Just tasted like tomato, but I finished the whole damn bowl anyway.Ok last trip, tried the dark chocolate chip pancakes. They were massive and a bit more on the savory side as well, not too sweet as they use a sourdough base to the pancake batter. It was accompanied by the barrel wood aged syrup that went really well with the pancakes. A great choice if you have a sweet & savory tooth.

We decided to check it out on a cold Saturday afternoon, which we later discovered was an excellent time to go. Delicious food and a charming atmosphere amounted to a great time at Little Goat. The fare at LG is a wonderful mixture of sandwiches, burgers and breakfast plates. The flavors are serious, as exemplified by the sandwich my girlfriend got: the Los Drowned. This braised beef masterpiece hit on all cylinders. The flavors of the sandwich were complimented by the textural contrast between the crunchy hoagie roll and the tender beef. After sampling some of the Los Drowned, I felt a little let down by my choice: the Korean kilgus goat burger. I decided to try it because I thought the kick would be perfect for a bitingly cold day. Although I was not surprised by how well the meat was cooked, I was expecting a more well-rounded flavor. While I do enjoy kimchee, it simply overpowered this burger. My sister ordered the horseshoe burger, an open-faced burger topped with chili fries. This burger looked difficult to tame and my sister looked a little overwhelmed by all the fries on the plate. Otherwise, she enjoyed it. The food was great, if just a tad bit overpriced, even for this elevated diner concept. We'll be back here again though.

I don't know if that gives some bias to LG, or raises the bar for it, but in any case that's a fact.Also, this review is for the \"diner\" part of Little Goat. I use the quotes because I've never had to wait for an hour to be seated at a diner, nor have I ever seen the food items here at any other diner. Yes, diners are known for gargantuan menus, but Asian influences (banh mi, kim chi)? Not so common.ALSO, nothing will ever replace my #1 diner, Merry Ann's in Champaign, a 24 hour diner that's prevented me from many hangovers (and has probably chopped off a few years from my life).But even after all that...Little Goat is pretty incredible.Started off with a cup of the goat chili, which is less chili and more than a cup filled to the brim with delicious ground goat. Easily the best chili I've ever had, with a few spicy/sweet/sour notes kicked in thanks to the toppings. Steph knows her goat.My girlfriend got the goat burger, done buffalo style. I thought it was cool they had loco moco as an option, the rice/hamburger/egg combo found in Hawaiian cuisine. It had just enough blue cheese so that you tasted it without it overpowering the burger, and the meat was juicy without being overly greasy.They were out of what I wanted for my main course, so I went with the pork belly/kim chi benedict. The pork belly was tasty and the kim chi wasn't as overpowering as I thought it would be. A good choice, but part of me wishes that I went for more goat. It's that good.And while I hesitate to call it a true diner, they sure try for it in many ways. The sit down counter, the long window into the kitchen, waitresses in skirts carrying coffee pots, the Heinz bottles on every table, and the cute and colorful laminated menus. It's a wonderful little mish-mash that any diner lover could appreciate.No doubt that I'm coming back, despite a few hiccups that come with every new opening.

I ended up with a Los Drowned sandwich that consisted of braised beef, avocado, butter case cheese, pickled peppers and onions, and spicy mayo on a hoagie served au jus. I thought the sandwich was delicious. The cheese was my favorite part, but the braised beef was also perfectly done. Even with my amateur palette, I could appreciate the combination of the many ingredients on this sandwich coming together without having one thing overpower another. I also went with the \"fall in a glass\" cocktail which was a whiskey based drink. While I liked everything I had, I think that the prices were really pushing the upper end of what I would pay for this again. It's all \u00e1 la carte, and a sandwich and side is going to put you around the $20 area for a full meal.

My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast yesterday, and it has been on my \"Chicago Bucket List\" since I read about it in the RedEye. My excitement was only heightened after reading all of the reviews on yelp. So here's the skinny on our experience:Interior/Exterior: It's in the West End of the Loop. Having never been there before we were intrigued to go. We were amazed at the beauty of the recent development that is has gone through in the past few years. Little Goat fits in this neighborhood like a missing piece to a puzzle. The neighborhood is charming, and the design compliments the hip and low key attitude of it's residents. \u00a0We liked the rotating door that faces the corner, and the potted pine trees on top of the building with twinkle lights. (They can be seen through the main dining rooms skylight too.) The burlap looking canvas shades worked nicely with the slightly distressed bold font on the windows. The inside of the Diner was gorgeous! When we arrived we noticed couples, families and groups of friends dining and eating happily. The setting is very casual and comforting, but modern and retro at the same time. It made me feel super cool and trendy just by walking in the doors. Theme's are created through use of bold textures and patterns: like refurbished wood, aged leather, and the strong presence of metals. I especially loved the light fixtures. (But hey, I'm an electricians daughter through and through.)Having arrived around 8:45 we beat most of the morning rush. Just after settling into our seats, we noticed a massive crowd at the front desk. The poor girls working hostesses were running around, but totally working it like pros.Our waitresses name was Lauren, and she was just as sweet as pie. Not only was she polite, she was always at hand and willing to answer any questions that we had. A+ for service! The other waitstaff was quick to fill water and coffee too. Our coffee was piping hot, and our water ice cold. My boyfriend and I were so excited upon gazing at the menu we could hardly keep the smiles off of our faces. We wanted to try everything, but in the end he ordered the \"Brandade & Belly Benedict\" and I had the infamous \"Bulls Eye French Toast.\" (Side note: We're total nerds and take pictures of our food. It's was sooo photo worthy. . )I cannot even begin to explain how aMMMMazing this food is. Upon first bite it \u00a0put our regular diner to shame. I can't explain my boyfriends opinion of the \"Brandade & Belly Benedict\" but I took the silence and the MMMM's and Ahh's as a good sign. My \u00a0\"Bulls Eye French Toast\" was exactly that. It was dead on the bulls eye! It was a dance of flavors upon my tongue which I had never experienced before. There was sweet, and there was zesty. There was smoky, and then there was a little tart. The textures were incredible. The bread was so fluffy on the inside, yet firm on the crust. At first I thought I was eating cake. I wasn't. This was better than cake. There was crunch and then there was smooth.We were so full halfway through our meals. We looked at each other, and knew we couldn't take leftovers with us to our next destination. So with a smile we found our spare legs and joined the clean plate club with glee. I would recommend Little Goat to anyone.

So we walked over and did put our names down for a table, then went to the nearby Haymarket & Brewery for drinks while we waited (see other review).We got our text exactly an hour and 15 minutes later (kudos for punctuality) but the Hosts/Reception not organized at all and we still waited another 20 minutes on arrival to be seated, with several false alarms (\"your table's ready- oh wait no, sorry...\"). Furthermore we waited all that time only to be set up by restrooms and coffee kitchenette. Grrrrr.Nice dining space, lovely little touches (see my pic of table setting). And I gotta say I loved the menu. So many options. I could safely (and wanted to) order ten different things and be just as happy with the choices. Or so I thought.For drinks we chose the Bellini. It was strong but bit bitterLike fellow yelpers, I went for the Bull's Eye French toast. We also got the Biscuit and Gravy and the Sloppy Goat. The biscuit was not fresh or warm (which surprises me since they have a bakery on sight) but the gravy saved the day- smoked sausage and buttery mushroom- this could have been happiness! The plate, gravy included, wasn't very hot though (it was literally room-temperature food) and it all came out 2 minutes after we placed the order. I think I got someone else's plate- UNACCEPTABLE. The French Toast was well prepared, and the sweetness of the syrup combined with the savory fried chicken was good, but it wasn't amazing. Very creative take on the chicken and waffle standard though. The bull's eye was the best part- a sunny side fried egg nestled in the center of the french toast. Score! The sloppy goat was ok. I enjoyed the squish squash bun but the chili could have been better seasoned. The rosemary coleslaw was a nice touch though and I'd say if you're ok salting to mask blandness, you might give this a try. Again, the food wasn't very warm. We had absolutely no room for dessert. I'd say maybe next time but given the wait and the \"Okay-ness\" of the meal, I don't think there will be a next time.

I've seen good improvement in the nuts and bolts of running a new restaurant (servers are now more knowledgeable, kitchen seems to be working together more cohesively), and as a result, I've seen marked improvements in the food. Granted, there are some dishes that still need to be overhauled (Loco Moco, I'm looking at you), but some of the dishes are AMAZING. Last night I had a love affair with the Chicken Cordon Bleu sammich. My friends were a little uncomfortable, but you know what, it was THAT good. I dreamt about it. The pulled pork sammich wasn't drowning in BBQ sauce (a good thing for those of us who like to taste the main ingredients; anyone can grab a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's and drown their food in it if they want that), and the Los Drowned is such a beautiful version of a braised beef sammich. The smoked fries and the fried pickled onions & pickles (YEP, they pickle the onion which gives the dish some extra zest) are must haves. The decor is classy but definitely reminiscent of a diner; it's just a more upscale, classy diner. Luckily they still retain the artery clogging grease in some of their dishes so that it's a faithul interpretation. Little Goat Bread turns into the house bar after 6PM or so, and it's a nice place to grab a quick drink if you have to wait for a table (which if you do have to wait, has been a fairly short period). There's so much more to talk about, but I'll end on this: there's a reason I keep going back to Little Goat, but there is definitely room for improvement.

Just the right amount of salty and savory with bacon and a little soy blend dipping sauce on the side. The dish really showcased the kimchee, which tops my list for most original breakfast dish.The hubby ordered the parathas burrito, which was also very good. I liked that it was served on indian flatbread and looked kind of like a hearty pancake stack instead of the traditional breakfast burrito rolled up with eggs inside. As this meal is vegetarian, we ordered a side of bacon to go with it. Yum. The bacon was cooked well, not greasy, and not at all as salty as bacon usually is.

If you're waiting for a table and you can edge in a spot at the bar, it's worth it. The diner itself is worth the wait (and I'm not just talking about the wait from when Stephanie Izard announced Little Goat until when it finally opened - I've been here twice, and waited 45 minutes once and an hour and fifteen the second time) and I love the text system that allows you to wander around or hit up another stop without risk of missing your seat. The space is fantastic, with comfy bar stools and kitschy Eames chairs that are reminiscent of a diner, but a sleeker look overall that makes the whole space feel a bit more indulgent. I'm a vegetarian, so I kind of expected not to be able to eat anything here, but the fried pickle goat cheese sandwich was amazing, as were the dark chocolate chip pancakes I had for brunch.

We got our coffee quickly, except for the cappuccino, and our food came out fairly quickly as well. Three people got pancakes, one a grilled cheese, and I shared the Brandade and belly (14) and goat burger korean style (13).

It was juicy, and everything about it was just delicious. The brandade and belly was interesting too and I was glad I got it. It was kind of like an asian eggs Benedict. They were generous with the pork belly,and it was cooked just right. The kale and kimchi went very well together too. All the portions were large, but we finished almost everything.

We ordered the Los Drowned, which was a good sandwich. Not terribly exciting or inventive but enjoyable. The Bulls eye french toast with fired chicken sounded awesome but our eggs were pretty undercooked and the ratio of chicken was a bit lacking. I'm not talking runny eggs either, because I like that. I was uncooked whites that got our attention. On a whim, we tried the mac and cheese and that ended up being our favorite. Really good white mac and cheese with some stink to it. Liked it a lot. The service was just ok. The waitress was nice enough, but it was pretty sparse, I never got a water refill, it took multiple request to have our leftovers packed up, and they charged me an extra 20 bucks which I had to have them correct.Not a bad meal or time, but kinda disappointed.", "Date": "2013-02-23", "Author_Location": "Morton Grove, IL"}, {"Author": "Sindhu H.", "ReviewID": "y8hUQ3CXc1vaMwh8HRCKHQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Been wanting to try this place after all the hype.

Cabbage kimchi, not overly ripe (I think it would have been terrible if they used slightly sour kimchi,) the right balance between to soft/chewy and crisp/hard. The little sandwich made me rethink of my arbitrary barrier between Korean food and everything else. My sis was nowhere near as hungry as me and she ended up ordering the crumpets and chorizo, which was a soft, savory/slightly sweet, and then she turned around and just ordered rolls and butter.We also got some beers, but apparently the beer list they had was inaccurate so it was like playing Blind Man's Bluff but drinking.

I had their Hoopoe's Hope which had Gin, Mathilde Peche Cocchi Vermouth, and Fresh Lemon Juice. It was very very tasty. The bartender was very helpful and despite him being busy took very good care of me and my friends. Instead of a pager they will text you when you are ready. The menu had a lot of twists to what regular diner food would be. I decided to try the Fried Pickles and Onion Rings with curry mayo as well as the Crispy Shrimp Cocktail romen noodle wrapped shrimp served over lettuce wraps that you are supposed to use to eat the shrimp with. The Onion rings pretty much tasted like fried pickles because the onions were fried with the pickles. The battery was very light and over all tasty. The Shrimp was a little different. I personally think there were to many noodles wrapped around the shrimp because on the outside the noodles were perfectly crisp but the ones on the inside were a little soggy. For dinner I had sunfish which had saut\u00e9ed sunfish, braised goat, over a warm veggie salad drizzled with goat's milk caramel. I had never had sunfish and was curious to try it. It was a light ok fish. The braised goat was obviously the winner of the medley of food in that dish. My friends had the fried chicken which has 1/2 Walter's chicken (a local farmer), with \u00a0mashed potato and slaw salad. The breading on the chicken was nice and when my friends asked for hot sauce they served to home made sauces which were very very tasty. We wished they sold the sauce in their shop. the mashed potato and slaw... Those are hard because everyone has their own taste. I am not a mashed potato fan so I can't comment on them, but my friends thought they were ok. The slaw lacked a lot of dressing. Maybe this is what Little Goat was going for, but we all found it to be dry. Overall dinner was acceptable. Waiter and staff was very helpful and friendly.

Starting off, I definitely recommend the Little Goat coffee, which has chai spices and goat's milk cream. I had the Bulls Eye French Toast, which is made with onion brioche, BBQ maple syrup, yellow tomatoes, and an over easy egg (which is cleverly hidden inside the toast). I did not think that all the flavors would combine so well, but it is neither overly sweet or savory. I also had a side of the cheesy grits, and they were more cheesy than I expected.

Like the full bar was full of people but the hostess told us we could go upstairs for now since that part was still under \"construction.\" And that top part was adorable, white tables and chairs, gleaming light coming through, a nice kitchen where I'm assuming all cooking classes and events will be. The place is just adorbs. Now onto the food, since everyone was raving about the shrimp sandwich, and it looked phenomenal, we had to try it. It was delicious, not the best sandwich I've ever had, but it was certainly tasty. Fresh, huge shrimp, avocado, a tarty cabbage slaw, and masa chips. The only thing I didn't love is the potato bread, it was a little too hearty, I felt like a sourdough would have tasted better, but otherwise, the flavors were truly awesome. My hubby had the goat chilli which I had a taste of and it was yummy, loaded with goat even though I'm not a fan of chilli, he really seemed to enjoy it.

The egg yolk inside the french toast was perfect, and the fried chicken is the cherry on top.-Tuna Melt: One of the more different tuna melts you'll try. Extremely rich, so we'd suggest sharing with \u00a0others so you can get a few bites before it gets old-Cornbeef Hash: Out of this world.

I was not able to make it to The Girl and the Goat, but we did make it to Little Goat for lunch on a weekday. Since we were on vacation we were able to eat during none rush hours. As expected the service was excellent. We, while honestly this was mostly me, took a long time deciding what to order. The waiter was helpful and was knowledgeable about the menu. Little Goat mixes the classic dinner idea with modern cuisine in both d\u00e9cor and food. Which was why it took a long time to look over the menu as there were many interesting options that you will not find else where. They do have some more basic items in case you are with some one with less adventurous tastes. I would normally say boring, but even basic items seemed to be done well based on our observation of other tables. \u00a0And the food lived up to the hype. I tried the tempura mashed potatoes starter based on the other reviews. They were ridiculously good and unexpected. We also had the pork belly pancake and a pork sandwich. The sandwich was good, but very messy and due to the coleslaw did not hold up as leftovers. The pork belly was awesome, and did not make it to be leftovers as it was gone very quickly. The meat was a bit fatty, but in this case it worked. They also had a cocktail list. The main part of the restaurant is a diner, but they have a bar/coffee bar/bakery attached. Good to stop by after or before if you have a wait. The peanut butter sandwich cookies were recommended by our waiter, and man was he right that we needed to try them.

It's all the commitment to flavor and distinctive ingredients of Girl and the Goat channeled into diner food. Open from 7 am until 2 am, I can't wait to go here when I'm near the loop and in desperate need of food late. I've also yet to try breakfast here, so eagerly looking forward to that as well. Will update this as it happens.The look inside is contemporary yet the ambiance is extremely casual and lively. The servers are dressed in classic diner apparel and extremely friendly and helpful. The first time I went we got shorted on the fried pickles part of the fried pickles and onion rings and our server got us more. They are really helpful with all menu questions too.The food is greasy diner bliss with fresh ingredients snuck inside. The perfect example is the Los Drowned, which is like a French Dip (served with a side of jus) but with purple onions and what looks like a pickle slaw of sorts. I've also had the patty melt with a goat patty and you can barely tell you're not eating beef because its smothered in excellence. The portions are large and worth the price, even a la carte. You won't want to save your money when you come here anyway because it all sounds so good. You'll be looking left and right wondering what your neighbors are eating.For sides/appetizers, the fried pickles and onion rings were disappointed, but the hash browns with goat cheese and the smoke fries (they smoke them for hours -- fries!) are delicious. I've yet to try dessert, but the milkshakes look heavenly.Unlike most diners, you can also order, wine, beer or mixed drinks -- in addition to house-made sodas and coffee, etc. I was really worried that the menu would be small, but Stephanie Izard has clearly made an effort to bring her food vision to as wide an audience as possible. This place is even family friendly, if you are looking not to compromise great food just to satisfy your child companions.I haven't been at all times of day yet, but I imagine it's crowded around the clock. Fortunately, I got in with no wait at the counter around 8 pm on a Thursday night and with five minutes wait on a Sunday around 5:30 pm.A lot of Little Goat is built on hype and Stephanie's reputation, but it's definitely a superior dining experience worth a journey to the West Loop.", "Date": "2013-03-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Caitlin F.", "ReviewID": "UVlpVXUq8y-KdR_FFXXmsA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's always worth the wait!!...One of my favorite places to go for brunch (especially after a night out!).

Simple and effective way to be able to walk all over the place while waiting and still not lose our spot. We took a counter seat at the heart of all the action. I would highly recommend this.Food: Spectacular. Wow. Breaded pork tenderloin was great. My buddy got the beef cheek stroganoff. Both of us were blown away. The creativity, texture and flavor were rockin'. Service: These folks were firing on all cylinders. Their e-ticket system went down while we were there but you would not know it. Helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. My buddy recognized the owner/ chef (Top Chef winner from season 4) as she stood in front of us at the counter but he was a bit too shy to say anything...so I did. Chef Stephanie Izard was gracious and warm. It topped off the evening.Ambiance: I can only speak for the counter...It was average to loud. It was all part of the experience and the decision to sit at the counter. It was all good. The place is hipster upscale yet casual. you can dress up or play it down and everyone seems to fit in.Extra: They have a bar connected around back behind (east of) the main dining room. It is a coffee bar/ liquor bar/ merchandise shop.

A friend and I decided to come her and it sadly it's not super easy to get to via public trans, but we made it there nonetheless. There was a 75-90 minute wait at 3pm on a Sunday. I suppose it is a Sunday, but that's quite a long wait for mid afternoon to \u00a0me. I guess that's what happens when you go to a Stephanie Izard restaurant (Girl and the Goat tends to be hard to get reservations for unless you schedule way out).After pleasantly waiting for our table at a coffee shop down the street, we were notified via text (wonderful feature) that our table was ready after only 50 minutes (be careful not to go to far as it took us about 5-7 minutes to walk back and our table was given to another group... but I didn't feel that bad about that).Our waitress was a lovely girl who gave us some great recommendations. I decided to order the Bull's Eye French Toast. It was stellar! An egg is baked into the middle of each piece of french toast which is perfect for dipping the crispy fried chicken that comes with these waffles. The onion brioche paired with the barbecue maple syrup made the flavor of this dish extra special. This definitely will not be the last time I order Bull's Eye French Toast!I decided to get a side of goat cheese hash browns. Though I love goat cheese and hash browns, these are nothing special, but since they are a side dish I wasn't totally expecting to be wowed. My friend decided on the grilled cheese which was a surprisingly huge sandwich and not what you expect in a grilled cheese. I didn't get a chance to taste it but he seemed to enjoy it.

The goat chili is very good. The goat flavor is not overwhelming. They did a VERY good job preparing the goat meat. My boyfriend ordered the sloppy goat. Again, very good. It is a mixture of goat meat and beef so the taste is not very strong, but you can definitely taste the goat. It comes on a warm butternut squash roll, which adds some sweetness to the dish.

The picked cabbage complimented the sandwich well and i absolutely loved the flavor of the au jus sauce that came with the sandwich. For dessert, we tried the blueberry pie.

My wife had the corned beef hash; the beef was stringy, the potatoes were flavorless, and it was sorely in need of spice, or some kind of seasoning. I also tasted a salmon salad, which was pretty good but not mindblowing. And the apple pie was a downer. Way too much pie crust, which was buttery and flaky but lacked crispness, and the small amount of apples inside were pretty bland. The chocolate shake was very good but also very expensive. I could look past the weaker parts of the menu if the service was better. But our server was fairly slow, forgot my wife's tea (and then failed to bring cream with the tea), dropped the check before asking if we wanted dessert, and affected an obnoxious \"old timey diner ambience\" attitude, calling the girls \"dolls\" and laughing each time he put down a plate; I have a feeling it was just as unpleasant for him to act that part as it was for us to hear it.

It was amazing, we realized after our 3rd bite, that there weren't enough crackers for all the dip, and before we even asked the waiter came back with more crackers. Im pretty sure hes a mind-reader.

This was the table that the hostess offered to us after we sulked our faces when informed that the waiting time was 45-minutes. There were several people already on the table, but there were seats at the end of it, which we parked our behinds in. The ambience and energy of the place was awesome and I was super-excited to try out the place for the first time. We ordered the cheeseburger, fries, fish tostadas and the burrito. The cheeseburger was cooked a perfect medium, the lettuce and tomato were fresh. The fish tostadas could have been better -- it had a nice crisp shell and the battered shrimp was somewhat unseasoned.... it was OK. The burrito was excellent, even though it didn't really look like a burrito at all. I was intrigued by the fried pickle sandwich, but I had to pull a Chris Rock when I saw it was $10... \"Ten dollahs?

It blended with the wall completely and the only thing that stood out was the door handle. Once you open the door, you'll find 6-private single stall bathrooms. The men's bathroom was nice and spacious. It was super clean, and they had one of those blowers -- not the Dyson once, but one of those ultra clean microban type ones. Surprisingly, the mens single stall bathroom was bigger than the women's, which I always thought was always the opposite. Anywho, sit or squat? Sit, read a newspaper, and let the good times roll as its a single bathroom, the place is noisy, and no one will hear the tunes that come out of your body, or the smell, as there's two doors of defense before you get to the dining room.", "Date": "2013-06-30", "Author_Location": "Rolling Meadows, IL"}, {"Author": "Samedog J.", "ReviewID": "IzolAbpDtwiE9nulYXDoyg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Meh.

How do we keep track of our position in line? They have a slick text messaging system to keep you updated on your position on your mobile device. \u00a0Damn near everyone in the place waiting for a table had a phone in their hands and were nervously refreshing their mobile device.Were our expectations fulfilled? \u00a0Well, sort of, table service was excellent. \u00a0Seriously, if you come in, ask to be seated with Ezra. \u00a0His service and sense of humor are fantastic. \u00a0As for the food, I must say that the food did not live up to our expectations or the inflated prices. \u00a0In fact, we found the food a bit pretentious for a \"gastronomic diner\". \u00a0We were there for late breakfast (me) early lunch (wife). \u00a0Here's what we had:1. \u00a0Corned Beef Hash and Eggs - sides ala carte. \u00a0So, side of potatoes and bagel extra - forget the bagel (smear extra too). \u00a0Ezra, I'd like the eggs basted. \u00a0What's basted? \u00a0Ezra, this is Chicago. \u00a0If the cooks don't know what a basted egg is tell them over easy then go find a cook that does, or alternatively I'll go in the kitchen and show them. \u00a0Ezra, I'd like the side of potatoes burned to a crisp. \u00a0In fact I want them so crisp that your tip depends on crispness. \u00a0Little did I know that the \"corned beef hash\" was really greasily prepared corned beef with (the same as the side) hash brown potatoes layered on top, not mixed with the corned beef. \u00a0Portion size? \u00a0Meh. \u00a0The side of potatoes came well after the corned beef hash and eggs - in fact we had to ask. \u00a0The potatoes were crisp and floating in more oily greasiness. \u00a0Portion size? \u00a0More meh, although I couldn't digest much for the oil. \u00a0Good news, the eggs were basted, but the whites were edge burned. \u00a0Oh well, they fried (sic).Breakfast observation: \u00a0LG is trying too hard to raise the gastronomic level of breakfast food. \u00a0I chose corned beef hash and eggs because there was one omelette on the menu. \u00a0There were numerous egg choices, however Kimchi and eggs (as an example) is not my first breakfast choice. \u00a0There were numerous pancake choices - not my cup of tea unless they're buckwheat (fat chance). \u00a0Heck, breakfast is breakfast! \u00a0Go to Meli or Yolk or Ina's (she has a parking lot and is just down Randolph).2. \u00a0Korean Burger - sides ala carte. \u00a0My wife ordered a Mac & Cheese side. She enjoyed the burger, which she said was way too much food and the Kimchi too bland. \u00a0She also liked the Mac & Cheese, but observed that the portion was shareable. \u00a0That said, my wife said she preferred the burgers at The Burger Bar or the Lockdown Bar and Grill (Kuma's Corner, not so much).Value: \u00a0We were there a total of three hours including the wait. \u00a0All of this fun cost a mere $45, plus a $10 tip for Ezra, plus $10 bucks for the valet. \u00a0What? \u00a0$10 bucks to park a car on Randolph and Halsted on Saturday afternoon? \u00a0Yup! \u00a0Be careful of the legal-looking parking space trap in front of LG. \u00a0The sign indicating Valet Parking is half a block to the right of LG. \u00a0The valet appears out of nowhere after you've unwittingly grabbed that beckoning parking space. \u00a0Since you don't have a clue how long the wait is, once you've committed your ride to the valet, your stuck with the wait.", "Date": "2013-01-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jeremiah B.", "ReviewID": "rk-rYszx2S11-Nms9BXvJg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In an area such as the West Loop with its abundance of dining establishments the Little Goat should make note of how other restaurants in the area take care of their patrons. \u00a0The service on March 27, 2013 was abysmal. \u00a0I attempted to order, by phone, a chickpea salad. \u00a0After several attempts at calling with only the answering machine picking up I finally walked over, I live two blocks away. \u00a0I went to the hostess station and asked to order the salad, I was told I would have to go to the bar to place the order. \u00a0I also inquired as to the answering machine pick ups and was told that they do not accept phone orders for take out, pathetic but their business choice. \u00a0I walk to the bar and place order. \u00a0The salad arrives about 5 minutes later and then I finish the beer I had ordered and walked home. \u00a0I open the salad to see that it is missing the falafel. \u00a0I immediately call them back and this time the hostess does pick up and I inform them of the missing falafel. \u00a0They say sure come back and pick the falafel. \u00a0On the other hand, when Sushi Dokku messed up an order several months ago they offered to send someone to correct the order, but then Sushi Dokku has a Bib Gourmand for a reason. \u00a0But I digress, back to the miserable service at Little Goat, I then walk back and have to go back to bar again to pick up the falafel. \u00a0At the bar I wait about five minutes before the falfalel is ready and then I depart with only a \"good night.\" \u00a0No, \"our apologies,\" no \"lets try to make this right,\" really no acknowledgment that they messed up. \u00a0As I said the West Loop offers many great dining choices. \u00a0GO ELSEWHERE.

Bloody Mary. Ever. Words escape me. I didn't think a tomato juice drink could possibly be this delicious, and yet here I stand corrected. No crappy zing-zang mix here, this bloody Mary is out of this world. I think if we could all start the day off with vodka, pickled onion juice, kimchi, masala, and miso adorned with a goat cheese stuffed olive and pickled pepper... the world would be a much better place. While I could probably live off of these bloody mary's alone, I thought it would probably be best to chase the vodka with some food, you know, since that's what we originally came for. This menu is certainly not for the faint of heart, or for that matter - those prone to heart attacks. The menu is ambitious, and delicious, but not necessarily nutritious. Fat Elvis waffles, breakfast spaghetti and bull's eye french toast (with crispy chicken) are just a few of the heavy hitters you'll find on the menu - so bring your appetite when you come to eat here. Sure, there are a few lighter and possibly healthier menu options... but let's be honest, that's not why you came here (it was for the bloody Mary). I tried the kimchee / bacon / eggs / pancakes Asian style breakfast tasty thing - and no I didn't forget the name of the dish, that's what it's called, and it's fantastic. It's a play on okonomiyaki - a savory Japanese pancake / street food. The combination of the crisp bacon, the soft eggs, the slight doughiness of the pancake and the tangy kimchee and ponzu style sauce was superb. Other than that, we got to try the breakfast spaghetti with clams 'n crab. This dish wasn't quite as enjoyable as the \"Japanese pancakes\", it was just a little too rich for so early in the morning. But throw a runny egg over clam/crab pasta with parmesan, pork, and bok choy any other time of the day - and I'm in. Aside from the fact that we were slightly caught off guard by the richness - this dish was great as well. Speaking of rich, the last dish we got to try was the brandade and belly. As the theme goes with the rest of the menu - there was no shortage of flavor in this dish either. Everything we tried was great, just don't expect to go run a marathon after eating here.Oh and they serve breakfast all day, 7 days a week, late night on weekends? You had me at bloody Mary.

This was for dinner on a weekday night with 3 friends. Fried chicken was sold out by the time we got seated.Started off with some Macho Nachos. Solid, very sizeable offering. Entrees:- Korean Burger - The goat meat was nicely cooked, if a little underseasoned. The bread was pillowy and great. The kimchi...was not kimchi. More like the regular pickled cabbage one would get at a Chinese restaurant to whet the appetite. Great portion size but overall, the burger needed a little more kick to it. - Kalbi Ribs - Came with 3 sets of Kalbi. The ribs were cooked fine, probably under-marinated because there wasn't a whole lot of flavor in the meat. The dirty rice it came with carried a great crispy texture but was a little too salty. The dish came topped off with crispy onions, strawberry, and zucchini squash which took the edge off the salty rice and actually brought the different elements together. A solid if not inspiring serving. - Pork Belly Pancake - Didn't get to try this but my buddy said it tasted like she was eating salt; the house hoisin was just too much for her. - Breakfast spaghetti - Meh. Tasted like any other creamy seafood pasta. Sides:- Mac and Cheese: Solid. Sprinkled with bread crumbs. Well portioned for a side. - Smoked fries: Smoky. This was probably the only thing we ate that grabbed my attention as something unique and interesting. - Tempura mashed potatoes: The technique for getting the nice tempura layer over the mashed potatoes is to be commended but overall, this felt gimmicky. Flavor had no depth and didn't taste special or interesting. Came in two medium size rectangles on a small plate. Service was fantastic, our servers were attentive and helpful. The atmosphere is designed to be a little upscale but feels relaxed and casual. A clean and fun place to eat. Although this just reminds me of Tyler Cowan's rule from an Economist Gets Lunch about trendy, good looking restaurants opened by famous chefs where the food quality nosedives after the first several months of being open. I'm clearly against the grain here with 2 stars but considering the price and pedigree of Little Goat, I was expecting solid dishes with inspiring and/or deep flavors. Instead, I was underwhelmed.

Let me first start off by thanking our waitress Christina. She was the perfect level of attentive. Not too much, but not too little. She was very friendly and informative, and seemed like she was able to hold down the section that she had (including us) very well. I am very picky when it comes to waitresses and she did VERY well. \u00a0Next, I'd like to thank Greg, the head baker. Not only did Greg go above an beyond by taking Taylor on a tour of the bread bakery (Taylor is a baker herself so something like is very special to her), but he also offered to let her come in whenever she'd like to help out and learn how they operate. As if that wasn't enough, Greg also had a special made bread platter with \"Happy 25th Birthday Taylor\" baked into it. VERY COOL and VERY UNIQUE! Greg was very personable and easy to talk to and I am very glad to have met him. \u00a0I would also like to thank Mark, the GM. Without him, none of this would've even been possible. I was in contact with Mark from the very start by email and he arranged for the entire evening including the tour of the bakery, a table being set aside from us, and the pastry department baking Taylor a special \"Happy Birthday\" cake. Lastly, I would like to thank the rest of the staff at The Little Goat. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with great respect and felt very warm and welcome, before they even knew who we were. Then I told them who were were and the friendliness doubled. The flow of birthday wishes to Taylor was a gesture that I, myself, very much appreciate. \u00a0 Now, as far as food and atmosphere are concerned. Let me put it this way...I cannot WAIT to come back! The atmosphere is that of a traditional diner, if it were given a good touch of class. Candles were lit at every table, people were dressed in \"dress casual\" yet, it was still the same volume almost as a sports bar. (not to say it was too loud to hear eachother talk, but it wasn't so quiet that you had to whisper either) \u00a0We started off with an appetizer of fried pickles and onion rings, with two sauces (ranch and curry \"something\"). VERY delicious and not overwhelming to where you'd be full to not want to eat your meal. Just what an appetizer is supposed to do! \u00a0For my meal, I ordered The Fat Club and got Smoked Fries with ranch on the side. The fat club is exactly what you'd think it would be, a HUGE club sandwhich with ton more than a standard club on it. I'm a 250lb athlete with an appetite, and I could only eat half of it. The fries were amazing (even though Taylor ate half of them! but that's love I guess). \u00a0Taylor ordered a goat burger, done All American style, with a broccoli puff on the side (which I enjoyed VERY much). \u00a0Then dessert was brought out as a surprise for Taylor, specially made just for her. Chocolate cake, with a peanut butter cream frosting, and what tasted like nestle crunch peaces at the bottom of the cake. Very delicious! \u00a0 Overall, I was more than satisfied with our experience and it means a lot to me that The Little Goat made Taylor's birthday special to her.

I've been here a couple of times now and the food was good enough that it made me consider retrying the restaurant despite the obvious lack of competent management. The restaurant has an automated wait list that will send out texts when your table is ready. Sounds good in theory, terrible in practice. The end result is that the restaurant seemingly holds tables for half an hour waiting for patrons to return. So if you wait inside, expect to become increasingly frustrated at waiting an abnormally long amount of time while looking at a plethora of available seating. On our first visit, multiple patrons that reserved tables after us were seated before us. When I came to inquire at the front desk they surprisingly aloof hostess said, \"Oh yeah, we've been looking for you.\" Thanks for both lying to me and insulting me. After waiting for an hour, we're seated.So we were seated, very willing to enjoy the great food and put the earlier frustrations behind us.We order coffee. Of course it takes fifteen minutes to come out. I enjoy my coffee black, but my girlfriend likes some cream and sugar. No cream and sugar comes out with the coffee. We asked the waitress for some cream and sugar and wait another 10 minutes. The food was very good. It was worth us trying the restaurant again.

When the waitress asked if we wanted a shot of bourbon in it, the table answered in unison by saying, \"duh.\" :) It's rich, very rich - it took 3 of us to work our way through it, but after each first sip (and until a pork chunk got stuck in the straw) we offered a moment of silence. It's blow your mind good. All of it, everything we ate was blow your mind good. It is hands down the best food I have had in Chicago so far. The place is huge.

Would totally recommend stopping in for a quick bite or to grab some food to take home. The next day I had my friends meet me at the diner and we unfortunately did not enjoy our experience as much. It was only the second day it opened so understandably there were a lot of kinks and some service errors. We were happy to overlook that but the food that came out did not impress any of us. We tried the eggs benedict (came out cold), the fat club (boring), duck sandwich (decent) and tuna melt (ok but covered in olives). They were all just ok which is not what I expect after waiting an hour to be seated and knowing how wonderful the bakery and Girl and the Goat both are.

We split the onion rings and the fried pickles. They were absolutely divine. A perfectly seasoned batter, fried to perfection, with delicious sauces to accompany them. As for the burger, I was in love. I can count on one hand the number of good veggie patties I've had in Chicago, and this makes the list. You can see tender chunks of vegetables throughout, and the patty is spiced perfectly. Not mushy, and crispy on the outside. The rest of the burger was amazing as well. Fried egg, kimchi, you can't go wrong. I was a little apprehensive about the kimchi as I had had Girl and the Goat's kimchi a few weeks earlier and it was very salty. This was perfect and gave a nice punch to the burger.Now, here's for the best part of the meal-the dessert. Holy moly. We ordered the peppermint mattie, which was spiced chocolate gelato, peppermint gelato, chocolate peppermint sauce and whipped cream. Absolutely out of this world.

Although we had been to Little Goat Bread several times before (and even got to meet Stephanie in person!) we had struggled getting seats in the Diner on various occasions (we're not ones to wait ~2 hours for a table...). However, we visited on an off hour this time and got lucky, because we walked in to the gorgeous diner and were immediately seated! The waitstaff was excellent; very friendly and in line with the staff at Izard's original restaurant across the street. As expected, the place was crowded. Definitely the place to try in Chicago right now. What we ordered:--Crispy Shrimp Cocktail--We loved this dish! It was the perfect appetizer to share and was a great take on the traditional shrimp cocktail; crispy shrimp wrapped in fried somen noodles with a dollop of creamy sauce on top of bibb lettuce wraps that were then dipped in cocktail sauce. This dish was equally creative and delicious. This is something we look forward to having again!--Fried Pickles and Onion Rings--This dish deserves some praise; it's an update on a classic guilty side infused with the thoughtfulness of Izard's menu. The perfectly fried onion rings were made with pickled onions, which gave every bite an extra bit of flavor. They were served with ranch and curry mayo dipped sauce, which we devoured. Definitely not your average side...--Fish Tostadas-- These were good, but probably our least favorite from everything we ordered and we'll opt to try something new next time. The tortillas were very crispy, the fish was lightly fried, and the flavors complimented each other well. We had three tostadas filled with crisp whitefish, shallot aioli, pickled jalape\u00f1o peppers, and a chickpea and onion salad. --Parathas Burrito--This dish was incredible, inventive, and left us wanting more! After much discussion, we agree that this was the most unusual and best thing we ordered. This breakfast burrito was made of an indian flatbread and filled with mashed potatoes, sunny side eggs, an avocado-bean salad, chili pepper sauce, and then topped with frisee and kidney bean salad that was tossed in a vinaigrette. It will be difficult for us to return to Little Goat without ordering this dish!We look forward to dining at Little Goat again sometime soon!

We also ordered the dinner rolls. \u00a0So far so good.I was not impressed with my salad when it arrived at my table. \u00a0The menu describes the salad's ingredients as the following: cabbage, bok choy, radish, red oak, crisp wonton, and ginger maple. The waiter also told me the salad came with kimchi. \u00a0My salad consisted of a bowlful of coleslaw, a handful of spring green lettuce mix, and 8 baby shrimp. The shrimp were tasty but I could have done without the mountain high pile of coleslaw. I did not taste any bok choy nor kimchi. \u00a0My dad's $22 fried chicken looked promising. However, the chicken's skin was not crispy. The breading fell off as soon as my dad dig his fork and knife into it. He did rave that the chicken was not dry. It was rather juicy. He also loved the mashed potatoes. So, I guess the fried chicken is a safe option to order. I would give 5 stars to the dinner roll alone. It was delicious. \u00a0I may try Little Goat some day for breakfast or bread. I hope that in the near future Little Goat can offer a few healthier options.", "Date": "2013-05-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Eileen Z.", "ReviewID": "zybQeRDuRx07MIMZ8bQlnw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Get the Los Drowned.

No, actually, I've never met her, but I have been to Girl & The Goat, and was not impressed. After a night of beers and Mortal Kombat at The Emporium (cool place!), decided to have late night diner food at Little Goat. A friend told us about it, and it was like, \"Ok, cool, let's go!\" But only afterwards did I find out how popular this place was! So, like a madman, I ordered everything that I saw mentioned more than once on Yelp, and ironically, the one 10/10 item here wasn't one I ordered. :/BULLS EYE FRENCH TOASTAccording to our server, this was one of the more popular items, so I had to get it. It's french toast with bbq maple syrup, sweet onion brioche, and crispy chicken. You get like 3 pieces of french toast, but they're small, like french bread slices, not Texas toast. There's syrup, and the fact that it's bbq doesn't really make too much of a difference, and you get like 5 pieces of crispy chicken. And no, it's not like 5 individual pieces of popcorn chicken, no no no. It's like a big McDonald's chicken nugget cut into 5 pieces. This was pathetic! Had they used actual McD's nuggets, I would've been happier, but the chicken was dry, and probably from Tyson's at Costco or something. The french toast was just french toast, nothing spectacular about it at all!CRUMPETSDo you know what crumpets are? I didn't, and I still think I don't know! Essentially, it's a biscuit shaped chewy pancake, though part of me though it tasted more like a biscuit. Anyway, this was basically pancakes with syrup and chorizo. The chorizo was very weak. Not spicy, not flavorful, but really dull. In fact, it added some gamy flavor to it, without hiding it in its seasonings and spices. When I swept the chorizo off, it was actually halfway decent, but this dish is just terrible and worthless!HOT CRAB DIPIt's a small dish of crab dip, and then bordered by a single layer of Ritz crackers. Problem is, the amount of crab dip you get is pretty good, but you get like 8 Ritz crackers, which is hardly enough to have half. You pretty much have to mound it on the cracker if you want to use it all up. We didn't, so I used the rest to flavorize my tempura mashed potato. The crab dip is good. It's cheesy, seafoody, and salty enough. Wasn't spectacular, but it was good. I might consider getting it again if I ever came back.TEMPURA MASHED POTATOESOk, imagine eating mashed potatoes by itself, without gravy. Got that bland taste in your mouth? Ok, now wrap the mashed potatoes in a layer of tempura batter and fry it. Now how is it? The same, right? The tempura really didn't add much. They serve it on a tray with some sauces drawn out so you can do that, but it's not really that good. I'd consider this a side-grade to regular ol' mashed potatoes. Quick Tip, though, it's decent if you put crab dip on top of it. It lends some of the salt and flavors to it.FAT ELVIS WAFFLESThis is the only thing I didn't order, but since I shared all these other things, a friend gave me half of his order. This was AMAZING! It's waffles with bacon maple syrup, fresh cut bananas and peanut butter-butter. Wow! The waffles start out crunchy, and the maple bacon syrup give it its sweet and smoky flavor. That alone, would have made it a 6/10. The bananas are so ripe and sweet and add a really good flavor to the whole bite. That ups it to 7/10! Then the peanut butter-butter. The thought of peanut butter on a waffle is not something I ever even thought of. The butter really does taste like peanut butter, but you don't have to worry about trying to spread it. It melts just like butter, and it really does taste like warm gooey peanut butter. That peanut butter flavor plus the waffle and syrup would have made it a 10/10, but the fact that it also compliments the bananas so well, makes this probably the best waffle I've ever had! SMOKED PORK & TOFFEE CRUNCHThis is a milkshake. They have to do something about pork fat and then take it across the street where they turn it into gelato or something, and then bring it back for the toffee. Ok, straight up, this is disgusting. The description made me want to gag (I asked for the description after I ordered), and you taste vanilla smokey pork fat! EW! I had some people try it, nobody liked it, and since it cost like $6, I had to just down it, so I did. The toffee crunch was very good, but the rest of the shake was disgusting! Never again!ONE LUCKY GOATIt really pains me to have to give this place 5 stars. The Elvis Waffles are so damn good that I was craving them the day after! And that's why I have to give it 5 stars. The problem is, everything else was so bad or mediocre, and it pains me that what would have been a 2 star rating \u00a0is now a 5!

For entree I ordered the Los Drowned, Little Goats version of a French Dip. DELISH. and ask for the hot sauces. Made in house and there was a habenero one that went oh so well with my sandwich... mmm. My DH ordered the Korean Pancake with pork Belly. He really enjoyed the cole slaw it came with but it wasnt my favorite, though a creative blend of flavors that I can respect. Also in our group was ordered the Kimchi Rueben, excellent, theloco moto Veggie burger, super hearty for a veggie patty, and the goat almighty, a wowza impressive monster that tasted like a heart attack.

We arrived at 1030am and were met with a 75 minute wait. We killed the time by walking to French Market and hanging out for a bit. They have a smart idea of texting people to let them know when it's their time to be seated. So smart and techy! When we got back to Little Goat at 1145, the wait had significantly died down and just a few people were waiting. My advice based on this experience is not to go at 1030 on a Saturday. :)The host was super nice and seated us in a booth which we were very thankful for. Our server was also super nice throughout the entire experience. Her outfit was super cute - diner chic purple with a little goat on the top. Loved it! I was obsessed with the music playing which was all 90s music and a lot of good 90s rap - I Get Around from Tupac played which had me boppin' in my seat! My two friends and I each ordered a main dish and then we ordered a couple of sides to try, as well. I started with the Chocolate Goat's Milk for $3. Personally I would skip this next time as I found it to be a bit grainy and not rich in chocolate. I got this for myself as a little indulgence and I honestly don't think it was worth the precious calories spent. Before I went I perused the menu and knew I wanted to try the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. Words cannot even express how good they were! I've never had a Crumpet before and my British coworkers had explained to me how good they were. I was psyched to see it on the menu as I'm going to London in 5 weeks and thought it would be good preparation! The crumpet was so soft and gooey which I love in my baked goods. None of that crunchy, overbaked grossness. The maple syrup...ahhhhhh the maple syrup. What a perfect pairing with the chorizo which had but a dash of heat to it. I was very happy that it wasn't overly spiced and just an delicious and simple, yet inventive, dish. I'm pleased to report it was a huge portion and with all our sides I was able to eat one crumpet while at the diner, one crumpet for dinner that night and one for breakfast this morning. Yep, it made me three meals out of this amazing $11 dish.I tried both of my friends dishes - Los Drowned $12 and Bull's Eye French Toast $13. The braised beef on Los Drowned was quite good & piled on but overall I wasn't blown away. The chicken and maple syrup on the french toast was great, as well but again not completely blown away.We ordered the tempura mashed potatoes ($5) and broccoli & cheese puff ($7) for our side dishes and that's when our brunch got super fun. At least for me. Apparently the usual puffs for the broccoli & cheese puff were not yet ready so they plated ours on top of more of a crumpet looking pastry. This was a total win for us because the pastry was so mouthwatering, the super nice manager brought it out to us & said Stephanie apologizes, plus we had it comped from our bill! I can't believe how super nice they were for such a minor change. We were completely okay with this and all enjoyed the pastry part of the puff very much! I preferred the tempura mashed potatoes of our two side dishes. We all agreed it was similar to a croquette except with tempura breading. It was so delicious I can't put it into words! With the little misstep noted above, my friend asked if we could meet Stephanie. Now I've seen her the three times I've been to Girl & a Goat, at Baconfest the past couple years and one other food fest...but I've never had any real 1 on 1 interaction because I'm such a nervous dork about cheflebrities. She was very nice and we truly appreciated her stepping away from the kitchen for us! She even let us take a pic with her...so sweet! We also took a pic with the manager because he was such a nice fella.Total for 3 hungry girls with tax and tip was $65. I was so happy to finally get to try Little Goat after anxiously awaiting it's opening and waiting for my time to stop in. I will absolutely be back and highly recommend the Crumpets to others going!Pro-Tip: No need for the $10 valet.

Instead of fleece as white as snow, this one's got food as big as your head, staff as friendly as a small town caf\u00e9, and coffee as fresh and great as a trendy Portland coffeehouse. I'm thinking Mary should consider a trade. With a grand total of 4 visits (twice to the diner and twice to the bakery side), I've fallen obsessively in love. My first visit, about a month after it opened, had my eyes wandering the restaurant as I sat, soaking up the entire ambiance. Plus the server uniforms give even more a personal, zany touch with the Tim Burton meets 1950s diner outfit for the girls and purple bowling-style shirts for the guys. \u00a0From the large amount of nostalgia (retro napkin cadies, counter seating along the kitchen, and cozy booths-a-plenty to name just a few) to the upscale contemporary touches (large skylight, clever \"hidden passageway\" style bathrooms, large community tables), it's kitschy hominess meets hipster trendy. After all the soaking, it was time to dive into the massive menu, boasting a total of 93 items. Rest assured, it's incredibly difficult to come up with a choice, with an abundance of twistedly clever breakfast options, massive sandwiches, and so much more fending for your attention, but on the same note, any choice is a great one. \u00a0Each item, which is just as intimidating in size as the menu it's found on, are served a la carte, allowing guests to mix and match sharable sides like smoked fries, tempura mashed potatoes or mac and cheese, making your entire meal completely customizable to your current cravings. The one that ultimately won out was the bull's-eye French toast, which promised sweet onion brioche with a fried egg nestled in the middle, pieces of fried chicken colonized on top, and barbeque maple syrup. With a description like that, this dish had a lot to live up to, and it delivered well above my expectations. Two hefty slices of savory French toast, perfectly crisp pieces of chicken, and two just-runny-enough eggs that all provided richness and salt, while the smoky barrel aged maple syrup laced with barbeque and sliced gooseberries provided a well-need sweetness to cut through all the starch and fat. All ingredients played their part well; the eggy brioche soaking up the yolk and syrup; the chicken giving a change of pace and crispiness; the gooseberries giving a unique fruitiness. Not one note falling flat, which shows the sharp attention to detail and technique that this place fully embodies. The staff is extremely accommodating and knowledgeable and the 16 ounce mugs baring the amazing Stumptown coffee aren't a bad touch either. Only nitpick? Water and coffee wasn't filled as often as I would like. But is that enough to keep me from coming back? Nope.Of course I would vow to come back due to the success of that first, albeit overwhelming visit and yesterday I fulfilled that promise. Everything that I originally experienced (the food quality, the staff friendliness, the fantastic ambiance) was brought to a whole new level, which showed how much this restaurant has grown even though there was hardly any need to. The meal of this visit came in the form of a Korean goat burger complete with a fried egg, tangy kimchee, smoky bacon, spicy mayo and, the star of it all, a bun calling itself a \"squish squash\" roll. What the kimchee lacked in spiciness, it more than made up in flavor, with an impressive vinegary flavor brought out by an extensive aging. The bacon and egg was just as good as the normally are on a burger. The goat patty had the taste of beef with a slight gaminess that made it more interesting than any other type of meat. Plus the crust that only a griddle can provide did its job well. But that squish squash roll had a unique texture and spongy porousness that soaked up every liquid but still held it together considering the heft it was pressured under. Bottom line: this is what you want if you're a fan of strong flavors. Smoked fries seasoned to the point where adding ketchup would be sacrilege and a palette-cleansing, tangy blood orange meringue pie added a large amount of support. While the food no doubt stole the show, it's the wait staff that adds the personality of this place, the type that holds conversations with you and gives you just enough attention to make you feel like you're receiving special treatment even though it was more than a little crowded, just like a real diner. Even if I was forced to find at least one, no nitpicks whatsoever. It's a one-of-a-kind feeling to watch a restaurant grow from its former self and Little Goat has become quite the well-oiled machine, each visit making the great increasingly better. \u00a0Although I haven't gotten a chance to visit Girl and The Goat yet, meaning I haven't had my taste buds seduced by the the pig face or pork shank, but this version is in a league all on it's own and it more than succeeds.", "Date": "2013-03-31", "Author_Location": "Addison, IL"}, {"Author": "Sue T.", "ReviewID": "MYq7fQ1tSTxk4UqqwUhwyQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a definite go-again for me.

Here's why. I came in last night at 9:00 PM. Knowing very well there will be a wait, I put our name down. They quoted me an hour (at 9:08 PM) and I agreed. They check you in, ask for your phone number, and said they will text you when the table is available. In the meantime, I went to the bar in the adjacent room to have a drink while we wait. We order drinks and wait... and wait... and wait... well, it's now 10:15 and still no text saying the table was ready. I walk over to the hostesses and ask about the status: \"Oh? You never received a text?\" \"Nope. Doesn't look like it.\" I have full coverage in the bar so I'm not sure if this was a phone provider issue or their machine is at fault. In either case, this needs to be checked because there could be other folks waiting for a text that will never come. It's all contingent upon a seemingly unreliable computer system and/or if you have AT&T/Verizon/Sprint/T-Mobile, etc. and if you can get proper reception in the restaurant/bar. Anyway, we sit down around 10:20 and I'm starving. We immediately order. We ordered the brandade and belly benedict. I liked the concept of this dish, but personally, I wouldn't order it again. The kimchi was not very fresh and it was sloppily thrown on the platter. I understand this is an upscale diner and perhaps that is part of the kitsch, but it just looked like one jumbled mess and not very appetizing. Moreover, I think there were too many flavors competing against each other... We also ordered the pork belly pancake. The scallion pancake was good as was the house hoisin sauce that covered the pork belly. I thought this was one of the more successful dishes of the night though it still needed some polishing. The pork belly was a bit dry but the sauce saved it! I think there was too much bok choy salad on the pancake overwhelming the ability to eat this like a \"sammich.\" Perhaps it was meant to be eaten open face, but you could also wrap the meat and veggies into the pancake and eat it like that. We also ordered a side of the tempura mashed potatoes. Very good! A must-try. The fried pickles and onion rings were also delicious... especially the ranch and curry mayo dipping sauces. Our server was friendly though she seemed quite rushed and not wanting to engage in brief pleasantries (i.e. \"How's everything tasting?\"... \"It's very good. I especially like the... \" \"Oh great!\" *runs away*)Overall, I liked the meal, but wasn't leaving with the feeling of \"OMG.

The space is nice; a large open room with an assortment of seats and windows looking out to Randolph Street. Stephanie Izard was in house and visible in the open kitchen (perhaps the best seats in the house are some bar stools looking directly into the kitchen). About the only knock on the space is tables are a tad small (but manageable) and as the venue will almost always be full (outside of off peak hours) it is a little on the noisy side; there were also lots of families with young children and infants adding to the din. We arrived around 10:20am on a Saturday morning and were promptly seated at one \u00a0of the last open two tops; soon afterwards people had to cue for a table (Little Goat is already extremely popular and likely will remain a hot venue for the foreseeable future). The menu rocks; breakfast is served all day and has extremely tasty options that are fit for foodies, but also several dishes that would appeal to those with more vanilla palates. There is a nice mix of savory and sweet options. My biggest problem was that so many dishes called out to me that I was racking my brain trying to choose my entree; I was pleasantly surprised that our server (Bess) already had such good command of the menu as we asked questions with the restaurant being so new and having a vast array of options. You would never know this was a new restaurant; service was friendly and attentive despite a full house and food was delivered fairly promptly. I wound up ordering the Breakfast Spaghetti n' Clams which was outstanding! It was fun having spaghetti for breakfast and it was served topped with clams, bacon, bok choy, parmesan cheese and soaking in a delicious sauce. I was in heaven. While prices run a few bucks higher than your run-of-the-mill diner (most breakfast entrees cost about $12), the quality and creativity makes it well worth the slight upcharge. In addition to breakfast fare there is a lunch menu with various \"sammiches\", salads, burgers (with different meats, breads and fixings to choose from), all sorts of snacks and sides, desserts and even a dinner menu (dubbed Supper Club). Several dishes feature goat such as Goat Shepherd's Pie (with a locally sourced shepherd) and a Sloppy Goat. Much of the food is rich and hearty, but there are some healthy (but nice) options for those watching their weight such as a turkey or veggie burger with sprouts, avocado, tomato and relish with a housemade whole wheat bun. My wife was in more of a lunch mood and ordered one of the sammiches, the Les Drowned: Braised beef with avocado, pickles, onion and spicy mayo served on a hoagie with jus for dipping. The portion was quite large and my wife (who has a hearty appetite) brought home half the sammich for later (if I do not get to it first; I snagged a couple of bites while at the diner and it was outstanding - the braised beef was literally bursting with flavor and the bread and fixings were fresh and delicious as well). She also ordered the smoked fries which were OK, but unlike the entrees nothing special and probably not worth the $5 surcharge. \u00a0Beverage wise we opted for coffee which also was quite drinkable, but as with the fries nothing special; the staff did a great job keeping our mugs topped off throughout the meal. Also available are some interesting sounding house sodas, juices and teas but no adult beverages served. With such a great menu and a fun, friendly vibe I would probably be here at least once a week if I lived closer. I would say that after just a single meal it has vaulted to number two on my list of best Chicago brunch options (with North Pond retaining the top spot, at least for now).

Th icing had a nice tang to it (goat's milk again? Hmm...) and the center of the bun had a nice big cinnamon surprise.I had to think long and hard to choose my main course and debated heavily between the breakfast spaghetti, the brandade and eggs, and the corned beef hash. My server, Patrick, helped me narrow it down with a good description of the spaghetti and brandade but after seeing a few plates of hash leave the kitchen I feel he sold that one a bit short when he described it to me. I will definitely be back though and the hash is on my short list of things to try. I ultimately chose the brandade and although I wasn't sure I was going to like it (house made biscuit topped with pork belly, fried eggs, kale, kimchi and pickled peppers with a very saucy brandade) I pretty much had my mind blown after the first bite. I would HIGHLY recommend this dish although it's definitely not for the faint of heart. The biscuit was AMAZING. I would possibly kill for that recipe... the pork belly was a nice thick cut, tender inside and crispy outside, good flavor and just salty enough. I can only assume that the kimchi was housemade and it was just right, not too spicy, not too salty, not too pungent. The kale was a nice touch, I don't remember it being in the menu description but I was certainly not disappointed to see it on my plate. Pickled peppers again a nice counterpoint to the rich brandade. The BRANDADE though... oh my. I've had brandade several times at several different places and it kinda just always the same, it's salt cod, potatoes, butter, etc but the brandade here at Little goat was delicious unlike any I've had before. Not sure if there was secret extra ingredients or if it was just better prepared or even just that it went so well with everything on the plate but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tend to order like a food critic, always looking for things that sound like they are going to fall flat due to the chef overreaching and sometimes I'm right nad they suck but at other times they turn out to be heavenly. For all of the craziness happening on my plate it somehow all wen together perfectly and I was very happy with my experience.

It definitely bummed us out, but we stopped into Au Cheval and luckily they weren't experiencing any problems - which is weird as Au Cheval is literally on the same block as Little Goat, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0On my actual birthday, the next morning, we decided to give the diner another try. \u00a0We got there around 1:00PM and it was packed, which we were expecting coming in around prime lunchtime. \u00a0They use a text messaging system for the wait list, which seems nice to most, but I personally didn't find it all that helpful. \u00a0I feel that it only made the hosts less personal - not remembering names and not genuinely listening to people's requests. \u00a0Also, you can track where you are at on the list by following the link onto the internet. \u00a0Our place in line changed frequently, somtimes decreasing and sometimes increasing - which was slightly mind-boggling. \u00a0We watched other parties go ahead of us that arrived after us, but we also understand that a party of three or four may be seated elsewhere than a party of two - so we didn't let that bother us much. \u00a0I was definitely getting antsy as we were quoted a half an hour and it was bordering one hour that we had already been waiting. \u00a0While I typcially don't mind waiting, my partner had to get to work and I also feel that the time quoted should be at least close to correct. We were finally seated an hour after we arrived at the counter facing the kitchen. \u00a0I felt that the counter was absolutely comfortable, being lower to the ground with comfortable stools and there was also a lot of counter space. \u00a0It was also exciting for us as Stephanie Izard was in the kitchen cooking right before our eyes. \u00a0Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but was still extremely nice and helpful. \u00a0We ordered Cheerwine to start off with. \u00a0While I have never had this soda before, my partner was oh so excited that they carried this drink as she has only seen it in the South. \u00a0For food, we asked for the Fried Pickles & Onion Rings as an appetizer and then the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing and the Spiced Apple Pancakes (with cream cheese butter and oatmeal crumble) as our main dishes to share between the two of us. \u00a0We received our two main dishes before the appetizer - actually, WAY before - as in we received our main dishes and then 30 minutes later, right before we were going to ask for the check, the appetizer then arrives. \u00a0We decided to just box them up and I said to my partner that the server must have mistakenly heard us say \"afterizer\" instead of \"appetizer\" - I was joking, of course. \u00a0As for the food...Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes - so eccentric and wonderful. \u00a0Neither of us had ever had anything like this dish before. \u00a0Typically I like my eggs with cheese, but this dish made me look at eggs a little bit differently and my love for cheese didn't even cross my mind. \u00a0It was refreshing and wonderful - I would recommend it to any outside of the box eater out there. \u00a0Spiced Apple Pancakes - were good, but not great. \u00a0While I enjoyed some aspects of this dish, I don't think I would order it again. \u00a0My best bites had a good amount of the oatmeal crumble on them, but there were many bites that were simply just \"meh.\" \u00a0My partner said she wished there was more of the cream cheese butter on the pancakes, but she also said she didn't taste any type of spice flavor and I agreed. \u00a0Fried Pickles and Onion Rings - were... fried pickles and onion rings - how can you go wrong with this one? Unfortunately, we didn't get to eat this dish right after it was prepared as it was delivered to us right before we were about to leave, but even as we ate them later on, at home, they were good! They are served with curry mayo and ranch - which I loved. \u00a0I love onion rings and my partner loves pickles so it was kind of a must get in our books. \u00a0Maybe it wasn't the best combination with our breakfast choices, but really, who cares? \u00a0As I sat and looked around I was just enamoured - the design of everything from the booths, the counter in front of the kitchen, the bar in Little Goat Bread (beside the diner), and even the windows on the ceiling in the middle of the room - it was all just wonderful and homy.

Soon enough, all our orders came except her sloopy goat. So, we asked the food runner to check on it. Later on, maybe about 5 minutes or so... Our server came to check in on us and we told her that we're missing the sloppy goat. She apologized and she told us that she heard the side of fries only and quickly put in her order. Minutes later, her food arrived and we ate in peace. I honestly didin't like my Los Drowned. There were not much flavors to me. I was expecting a little spice because of the spicy mayo being one of the ingredients and I did not taste that at all. I had two bites and asked for it to be wrap to go. My friend said, her sloopy goat was okay and ate more than half of it. I didin't try hers, so, I can't really say anything about it. However, the fries and the mac and cheese was heavenly. I thought they were really really good. We thought the place was decorated very nicely. I was very impressed at the decor and even the chairs for the long tables.

The french toast and chicken were cooked fine, but the egg inside the toast, not so much. It was so runny the egg white was still clear around the yolk. I showed my neighbor as we sat in the community table and he hoped for my benefit that the egg was from a reputable source (I'm pretty sure it was, like 95.8% sure...eeek?). Also, there seemed to be a smidge of curry I think in the batter, which I didn't mind. The Los Drowned was a good sammy, like a French dip with cheese, avocado, and mashed up black beans on the bottom and au jus to dunk in. The mac n' cheese was creamy and sharp, it tasted like it might have had goat cheese in it. As we later found out in talking to our neighbors, it seemed each of the items they had (the dudes to my left had onion rings and fried pickles, and the guys to my right had hash browns with a fried egg) that one or another of their items have either curry or goat cheese. I sense a theme?+How is the coffee? I got the Little Goat coffee. Espresso with goat milk and whipped cream and a caramel drizzle. Was good, but the large had way too much milk to espresso ratio (you'll need at least 3 shots if you get the large, as the standard offered is only 2).

The goat chili was delish but heavy because they are pretty generous with amount of meat. \u00a0It would be nice if they had a chili and bread option. \u00a0I think $6 is a little high for the small portion you get, but I'm unfamiliar with how much goat is. \u00a0My coworker really liked the chocolate croissant. \u00a0I thought it was a little expensive at $4 (compared to the high-value sandwiches) but she thought the flaky-to-chewy-to-chocolate ratio was perfect, so I guess it's worth it?All in all I think Little Goat has a lot of promise. \u00a0The staff, if they stay this nice in the long term, are really great. \u00a0I think they know it's a little insane to wait 25 minutes for a sandwich to-go and they appreciate that people do. \u00a0Hopefully the kitchen will get a little more streamlined and the sandwiches will come out faster. \u00a0Looking forward to trying other sandwiches there in the new year!", "Date": "2012-12-20", "Author_Location": "Santa Monica, CA"}, {"Author": "Dan S.", "ReviewID": "3kX6hR6M4acdDI02_HWbVQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cool place.

I really like the space and the vibe -- it's cheery and well-lit and the service I have had has been good. Not overly intrusive, but I never felt forgotten. Confession: I've only had salads here. They are not the focus of the menu. I've had the Asian shrimp salad and Steph's Salad. Both were okay. Good, substantial portions, but both times, the lettuce was just not the freshest. Definitely some wilted lettuce in there...didn't seem local or fresh, more like a few-days-old-Jewel-quality. Which was disappointing. Not inedible, but not what you would expect when you're paying $14 for a salad. And both salads were a bit overdressed, so everything got soggy quickly. I was also confused by the two dressings on the Steph's Salad -- it comes tossed with a tamarind dressing, but then they also give you ranch on the side. But the salad already is dressed in a creamy dressing so the ranch seems redundant. I added a little, to see if it, like, revolutionized the flavor profile or something, but no dice. Just added Ranch flavor, which seemed random. I only need one dressing on my salad at a time (call me old school).

I have made bagels at home before and these are on par with what I made. \u00a0They are time-consuming to make, so thank goodness for bagel places, right?? I really like the everything bagel with green bean cream cheese. The grumpy goat bagel (raisins and cheese) is great with the honey masala cream cheese--a little sweet-salty combo.

I want to preface this by saying that from 1998 - 2004 I worked in restaurants as a busser, hostess and waitress from 16 until I finished college, so I am pretty familiar with how things go in restaurants and am extremely sympathetic to my brothers and sisters in the biz because I know how hard you work for very little in the way of thanks or compensation.That said, if I could give the hostess negative stars I would. After waiting 45 minutes for a table(it was Sunday at 10am I get that we would have to wait) we were called up to the host desk to get our table. Being starved and in need of more coffee we were excited to be seated. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. I finally asked what the hold up was and was told they were clearing tables. I said ok and proceeded to wait more. I noticed a fully bused table and asked the hostess if that was our table, she said no, the one next to it that still needed to be bussed was. (Quick sidenote as a hostess I was often expected to bus tables and grab waters and coffee for customers if we were slammed so I wondered why none of the hostesses were helping out the staff) I explained that my friend was catching a flight to Atlanta and could we just have that one. she shouted at me \"No you can just wait another 30 seconds until your table is ready!\" Whoa. Um ok. I would have happily continued waiting at the little coffee bar in the next room where I was but you paged me up here 5 minutes ago to \"seat\" me. I was stunned. A- because I was trying to be polite and B- because really who speaks to a customer that way in front of a crowd of other customers. My friends and I were totally stunned. Then she stormed off to the kitchen and came back with a busser/server and we were seated. Another busser who brought our plates and specifically said to me \"This one is your plate\" um ok. My friend made a comment that the hostess must have ordered a plate with something \"special\" on it for me. I laughed but was unsettled and didn't eat off that plate. I felt really awkward for the rest of the meal.I will say our waitress was a delight and I told her so. The food was fine, but I have had better biscuits and gravy. I was excited that they had Stumptown coffee as it gave me warm fuzzies remembering a recent trip to Portland.Unfortunately, those few good things did not make up for the treatment we experienced there and my \u00a0friends and I have decided not to return.

I really wanted to like you but you disappointed me.A friend of mine and I came in on Friday night around 7:15. The place was crowded and we had about a 30 min wait. Not bad! We weren't starving so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. (On a side note I thought it was very cool that they text you when your table is ready.) The bar area is a little small because it's a combo bar, store, and coffee counter. Different but I'll go with it. We finally got a table and ordered food. My friend got the salad and I got the chili with a side of roasted root veggies. We also shared the blood orange meringue for dessert. The food was good but that's where it ends. We sat at a table by the bathroom but you wouldn't know it because the door to the bathrooms blend in with the wall. Whaaat?!? Why wouldn't you want people to know where the bathrooms are?? There isn't even a sign. Nope, not one indicator. One of the bus boys was basically directing people all night. And at one point I even told someone walking by that yes that was the door to the bathroom.When we were done I paid for the meal with my credit card and our server came back saying the card was declined. The error message was something related to \"batch full\" or something along those lines. My girlfriend owns a bike shop and told him that there wasn't anything wrong with my card, it was a problem with their system and they needed to batch out all the transactions from earlier in the day. After he talked to the manager, he came back and said indeed there was a problem with their credit card machine. So we waited... he came back about 20 min later and told us it was still down so we waited some more... 20 min later he stopped by and asked if we needed anything and apologized for the wait but the machine was still down. So we waited even more... at one point my friend and I heard a waitress tell the table next to us that the machines are down and the couple got up and left. I asked my friend if they paid or if they just got a free meal? Neither of us knew for sure. That's when our waiter finally came back and said they would have to use a manual machine to run my credit card. Really?! Um, ok. We ended up being there for 2 hours and 45 minutes and wasn't offered anything for having to sit there and wait for their credit card machine snafu. It was a little disappointing that we were inconvenienced like that and they didn't do anything to rectify the situation.

Just awful! Where do I start.... We sat at the counter... no big deal... I enjoy the counter. At LG, my husband and I had a front row seat to a disaster!

The cold factor can be explained by the food just sitting for an unreasonable amount of time on the expo line. Mac and Cheese - could of fooled me... it was more like mashed potatoes. The noodles were SO over done - they were just mush. The cheese was gritty - like powdered cheese out of a box. The flavor was also completely tasteless. Burger - ordered it medium - got well done - almost burnt. Again, complete tasteless. No flavor. Dried out beef. It was the Korean burger so I was expecting a little flavor, instead, I got over cooked, dried out, tasteless card board disguised as beef.

I must admit that I am biased, as I've had a foodie crush on Stephanie Izard since Top Chef Chicago, but I was thoroughly impressed. The menu is a twist on classic American food; it's the grub at your favorite 24-hour diner, except that most of the offerings contain pork belly, kimchi, or (of course) some kind of goat product. We split a smorgasbord of food. Biscuit and gravy is a winner; towering, airy, just-buttery-enough biscuit topped with a sumptuous saucy gravy. Hash browns are grated finely and mixed with nuggets of creamy goat cheese. Mac and cheese is very rich, with a crispy top as it ought to have. Both breakfast food offerings we sampled were divine; the kimchee, bacon and egg pancake is the most inventive iteration of the \"grand slam\" style breakfast I've ever seen (which is not to say that it resembles anything you would try at Denny's), and the pork belly pancake is a more refined version of the street offerings I enjoyed in Bangkok; can't say I know of many diners that crank out scallion pancakes. In my mind, however, the show stealers were the burgers and sandwiches. Sloppy goat sandwich has the same homey flavors of an all-day cooked Italian potroast; slimy, yet satisfying. Burgers are offered permutation style; diners choose between \u00a0goat, beef, turkey, or veggie patties, with a variety of topping combinations; we opted for goat korean style (kimchi, bacon, egg on a squash roll) and beef \"wing\" style (buffalo sauce, bleu cheese, celery, onion on potato roll). While I can't include these in my burger ranking calculus just yet (as we ordered them medium to assuage our large crowd), I suspect that they'll be in my upper echelon, despite my preference for spartan patties. The meat is moist and cooked to order, the buns are among the best I've tried, and the accoutrements, while whimsical, do not distract from the meat, but enhance it. Desserts range from childhood classics (cookie pie) to truly off the wall (smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake). All of them are decadent and beyond worth the calories. Drink menu is short but sweet, with 15 excellent beers on tap, including a sumptuous red ale that Haymarket whipped up just for Little Goat. As if it needed another plus, the coffee bar makes the meanest macchiato I've ever enjoyed stateside. Pricing is, obviously, not what it is at your hometown diner (everything a la carte, sandwiches and burgers $10-$12, sides $5-$8, desserts $6-$9), but for the quality of the food, it's pretty much a steal. Service is very attentive and personal; just as is the case across the street, Little Goat does a good job hiring people you'd actually want to hang out with, including (and in our case especially) the busboys. Also, they brought Stephanie by our table, which was awesome (even if I managed to make a fool out of myself due to intense star-struckness). Ambiance is modern but thoroughly inviting; it was very difficult to convince everyone to leave. With the caveat that I'm seeing this through intensely rose colored glasses, I must say that I found Little Goat to be among the happiest places on Earth.

For a diner it is over decorated, for finer dining it was awfully loud. So loud we could not hear our server. The menu was limited to a few overthought choices. I wanted a traditional breakfast so I selected the small biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs and the cheesy grits. Biscuit was enjoyable with good texture but lacked ample gravy. A tiny ladle was stripped across the top. The eggs were small, obviously not grade A large. The grits were disgusting; coarse and bland! The chef fails at knowing grits are that in name only, not in texture! I had to remind myself I'm in the Midwest and some people are not familiar with their true form. They were also cold and only earned the cheese in their name from the light sprinkle on top. I could have ordered similar food at any diner in town and had better quality and flavor for a fraction of the price. My partner ordered pancakes that as he put it, were \"meh\" - also not worth the price for the average quality. Pancakes are a staple of any attempt at being a diner and is something you need to get right! Our friend had the prathas breakfast burrito. It was served open faced??? with the eggs underneath and piles of toppings on top. It looked more like a salad and was difficult to eat. A scone we shared was the best part of our meal but the heavy use of fennel seed made it uncomfortable to eat. We are honestly dumbfounded by the glowing reviews as this is clearly a place heavy on style and LOW on substance. Yes, the place was beautifully decorated inside and the server was attentive but overall I go to a dining spot for the food and judge it based upon overall quality versus the price.

Nothing special. Just tasted like regular fries. Think I was expecting something else. My friend order the fried pickle sandwich. She said it was pretty good and it looked great. My issue was the chili that I had maybe 4 bites of. Everyone has there own version of chili, mine was definitely not at little goat. The menu description of the chili was deceiving. I tasted either a lot of apples or apple cidar vinegar. Blahhhh!!!! in the description there was nothing about it that said sweet. I like a chili with a little spicy. Not one I feel like I'm dipping my apples in. Other than that, I'd go back to try the shakes but was just exhausted and had to leave. The only other thing I saw was \u00a0 those uniforms!!!!!!

Our Sunday Brunch at 11:15 am had a 2 hour wait. \u00a0I was coming with some friends from the suburbs and we had other things to do while we waiting or I would have never even gone. \u00a0I do not wait 2 hours for a diner. \u00a0Or anywhere else for that matter. \u00a0The wait ended up being close to 1.5 hours, I guess that is better than 2 hours, but certainly not a short wait. The glasses and appetizer plates had more than spots on them. \u00a0I think they need to check their dishwasher because there was crud on all of the serve ware we had. \u00a0This screams dirty diner, not expensive upscale diner. \u00a0The food...I ordered a cup of tomato apple soup and was brought chicken bacon. \u00a0Once I tried it and realized it was smoky bacon in there and not tomato I had to track our server down to let her know. \u00a0Her excuse for this was that the runners see red (since both soups are red) and just grab one. \u00a0It happens. \u00a0Thankfully I am not a vegetarian, but I have a big problem with this. \u00a0Who is expediting? \u00a0Why would a runner not check to make sure they have the correct order? \u00a0 Hopefully this is something that more training will work out? \u00a0The soup itself was pretty good. \u00a0Not WOW, but good. \u00a0I would get the goat chili every time though, it is fabulous. \u00a0Per my waitresses recommendation, I got the Los Drowned sandwich. \u00a0I was looking at the Reuben and she told me that I shouldn't get it that its just a Reuben, that the Los Drowned was like a way better version of an Italian Beef. \u00a0This was not the case. \u00a0Reading the description it sounded great, but sadly my meal did not resemble anything that was described. \u00a0It looked like it had been thrown out then placed back on my place. \u00a0It was beyond Soggy, you couldn't even pick it up. \u00a0The juice from it was just swimming all over the plate. \u00a0There was extra au jus for dipping, but I couldn't image as it already seemed as though it was dipped. \u00a0I expected some kick or at least some really good braised beef inside. \u00a0Bland, no flavor. \u00a0I would order this from a fast food joint for half the price before I would order from here again. \u00a0I noticed after I read descriptions online that it should have had avocado, mine had none. \u00a0Once our sever came back around I let her know that she was totally off the mark on that recommendation. \u00a0She did offer to get me something else and I took her up on it. \u00a0 The waitress proceeded to tell me she only had it twice, once prepared by the chef and it was bland and greasy, then once when Stephanie was on the line and it was great so she had thought it improved. \u00a0Stephanie was there that day, but did not see her on the line. \u00a0However, her cooks have to be able to carry out her vision and recipe consistently for this to work. \u00a0Chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich- My friend ordered this and it looked good, so this became my replacement order. This was great, I would definitely get this again. \u00a0Full of flavor, everything went very well together. \u00a0I wished I had ordered this from the beginning. \u00a0Smoked Fries: These were just ok for me. \u00a0They had a good amount of seasoning on, but I don't think they really did it for me. \u00a0It was kind of like a bbq french fry. \u00a0I didn't dislike them, but I probably wouldn't feel the need to ever order them again. Additional items: my other friend had the Elvis Waffles and I had a bite, they were really good. \u00a0If I were in the mood for breakfast, this would definitely be on my list of things to get. \u00a0I am hoping that with time most of the quirks will be worked out and consistency of the food will improve. \u00a0For now, I will go with my 3 star review. \u00a0We will be back to try dinner when there is no wait and maybe the score will improve. \u00a0While the diner is working on getting up to par, I will certainly continue to go to LG Bread in the mean time! \u00a0I already miss the upstairs dining option but hope that some classes or dinners are coming soon!", "Date": "2013-01-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Elizabeth P.", "ReviewID": "O0kEniCMmmbzwUPpWBeMEQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Dining here was one of my first foray's into the dinning mecca of Randolph Street, so I was excited when my family and I walked by and saw it wasn't crazy busy and little to no wait (about 8:30pm on a Thursday...actually some what surprising). \u00a0Definitely a cool looking restaurant with some great design, but really quite noisy. \u00a0It was hard to hold a conversation with the others at my table. \u00a0The menu had some interesting items, but maybe it was just the mood I was in, but nothing really stood out to me and wow'ed me. \u00a0The food wasn't bad when it arrived (I got the bullseye french toast) but others in my party were generally disappointed. \u00a0The overall service was pretty mediocre. \u00a0We ordered the Hot Crab Dip, which was ok but didn't have nearly enough crackers. \u00a0It was hard to get someones attention to get someones attention, so much so that someone in my dad had to get up and find someone. \u00a0Water glasses and drink glasses were left unfilled. \u00a0I want to give The Little Goat another chance, so I'll try to return someday, hopefully for a better experience!", "Date": "2013-07-12", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christopher L.", "ReviewID": "LF7idNwliTJBrnVV_j8kBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went for breakfast and got the kimchee, bacon, eggs, pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.

We sat in a communal table with a couple other parties. I was worried how they'd react to my daughter who tends to throw food sometimes. But they were receptive. My daughter just stared. Red hair and facial hair keep her interested for a while. I sleekly glance at their half eaten food as I'm trying to decide between the egg, pancake, kimchi Asian breakfast or the breakfast spaghetti w clams. The apple pancakes and hash browns next to us do appeal to us (me, really). We order both the Asian breakfast and breakfast spaghetti for ourselves. We also get hash browns w goat cheese and the apple pancakes \"for my daughter\". Everything was delicious. I saved half of my savory dish for home. There were thick chunks of bacon. The pancakes and eggs mixed together w the crunchy bites of kimchi. It came w a vinegar sauce on the side, which I used sparingly. The tartness and acidity cut the richness if the dish. Like the dipping sauce to a potsticker. Or simple distilled vinegar and garlic to longanisa. Mmmm. The hubs spaghetti was coated in egg w fresh clams. Very rich. Very unlike a usual breakfast. Unless you ate a Filipino house (where sometimes last nights left over chicken adobo sauce gets blended in a fried rice w an egg on top). The hash browns were the usual geared potato browned on a skillet but w a creamy goat cheese treat melting inside of it. I grew up on goat and it kinda scarred me. That pungent uric acid aroma that rises in the back if your pallet as you exhale turns me off. I overheard the party next to us rave the hash browns. Saying \"so creamy but the goat cheese is undetectable and subtle\". WRONG. It was delicious if you like goat cheese. But not as subtle to me. The hubs did love it. And the girls in the party next to us must have had stuffy noses. The apple spiced pancakes were also delicious. With an oatmeal crumble and cream cheese atop. A nice sweet ending to our savory meal.

The Boy's parents were in town for the weekend, and this seemed like the perfect, casual but grounded place to take them. First, we arrived around 8 pm on a Friday. Working in the industry, I know this isn't the ideal time to go to a restaurant, especially without reservations. The hostess took our name and told us it would be about an hour, and that she would text us - yes, text us - when our table was ready. Sorry, Lil Goaty, but texting isn't hostessing and never will be. We finally got to our table. Another 20 minutes passes and our server finally comes up to us, and said, \"whaddayawannadrink.\" Literally, that's it. I shouldn't be so critical of waitstaff because I know it was super busy that night, and I know she probably had a lot on her plate -- but we didn't even have anything on ours. The food was good, I think, a little pricey for what we got, but hey. Unfortunately, I can't look past the quality of service. We could be getting Big Macs or filet mignon, and it's all going to be awful if the service is awful.

I have been here 3 times in the last month. The first two visits were solely for the purpose of eating breakfast and the last visit was for dinner. Visit 1 was great. The server was cool, attentive, and answered all our questions about the menu without any apprehension or uncertainty (the menu has several unique combinations of ingredients and some items we were unfamiliar with). I ordered the cinnamon bun, which I highly recommend!!! I also ordered the Little Goat coffee which was sooooo good (you must be okay with goat's milk, because the flavor is pretty strong). I ordered the Spanish omelette. To say the least it was amaze balls. I am a big breakfast guy, and I have a sweet tooth. My go to breakfast is always french toast. But I decided since this place is suppose to be awesome and comes with the reputation associated with girl and the goat across the street I am going to challenge them with my least favorite breakfast item. They knocked it out the park. It literally looked like beams of light from heaven were shining down on my omelette giving this shiny gloss of perfection (there is a skylight, so technically there were beams of sunlight coming through the ceiling and lighting up the room...and my omelette). Everything about my omelette was awesome. My friend ordered the Reuben and I had a bit and it was sooo tasty. The bread looked soo good and the ingredients looked fresh and abundant. I recommended this place to my friends who were in town for the weekend to celebrate a birthday and they loved it. I went back with my brother and his girlfriend and this time around I ordered the french toast. Their was an egg IN the french toast. I tried to order the cinnamon bun but they were out. I was surprised because it was 9AM on a Monday (they open at 730 i think), but because they are so damn good I figured they must have been in high demand earlier in the day. My brother and his girlfriend ordered something on the menu that looked great and they said it was great but I was to preoccupied with my own breakfast to take any notice. The bacon maple syrup was something out of my dreams. Our server on this visit was this really beautiful brunette who I gave an \"I Love Pencils\" pencil too in addition to the tip we gave her on the bill. She was very nice, professional, and well versed with the menu. She answered all our questions and checked up on us several times to see how we were doing. My most recent visit was this evening with an old college buddy and my roommate. We stopped in for dinner and I ordered the Fat Club sandwich. My buddy ordered the Sloppy Goat, and the roommate ordered the Los Drowned (braised beef and buttercase cheese among other deelish ingredients). He says it's basically their take on a french dipped sandwich.The sloppy goat was good according to my friend. He really like the cabernet he ordered. I liked my fat club sandwich but didn't love it like I loved my omelette and french toast. I think I should have gone with the Reuben. There was nothing wrong with my sandwich. Ingredients were beast mode and super abundant and fresh. Nothing about it wowed me except the size o the sandwich. I remembered the reuben had a really good flavor about it that stood out for me. The server was really nice. She got me a spoon for the coffee i ordered so promptly that she ninja'd it next to me and I hadn't noticed. When she came back to take our order I asked for the spoon for a second time and she pointed out that she had already placed it on the table for me. I had requested with such a snobby tone and she handled it like a pro and smiled. Kudos to her. I know I can be a brat sometimes. Overall service was stellar every time. Food was 9.5 out of 10 every time. Keep doing what you're doing Little Goat. Just please make sure to have Cinnamon Buns 24/7 because you guys are sooo good at making them.

I am a devotee of crusty, crispy Montreal-style bagels...these are not like that. These are not actually directly like any other bagel I've ever had. They're not American-pouffy, New York chewy or Montreal-crackling...they are compact, divinely flavorful and 'just-right' dense...And, my Everything bagel had the everything on the Inside - great idea and I didn't have to take a lint roller to my scarf afterwards. I picked the smoked salmon CC and it was lush. The espresso (Stumptown coffee) was...a great espresso, good crema, not bitter at all...and still hard to come by in most neighborhoods (but not this one). On that trip I took a loaf of Fat Bread home (with a smoked duck fat base) for an orgiastic two-day tour of applications that included absurdly good french toast, the greatest grilled cheese sandwich ever and just rippin and dippin with good olive oil. Trip 2 - just takeout...Bagels were sold out so we got Fig and Black Pepper scones, a loaf of cheddar broccoli bread and a 1/2 pint of that smoked salmon CC. The bread and CC await deployment for breakfast tomorrow but...A Word on Scones. Perfect. So rich, so buttery, the amount of fig just right (I sound like Goldilocks) and the pepper providing a perfect counterpoint note. Damn. It was almost a Proustian madeleine moment to bite into one. I used to eat the also-perfect scones at another biz in my review roster a couple times a week...these fig scones really took me back. And A Word on Prices - brace yourself price-refuseniks...Little Goat's fresh baked goods are CHEAP, the opposite of pricey...this quality of merch at these prices is simply amazing. The scones were 2 dollars apiece. I got three. My beloved Ginger scone, from the 'other place' costs 5.99 (and that's not a knock) but...damn again, appreciate that.

Had I never heard of this place I probably would have given it 3 stars for uniqueness of the menu alone. Let's start with the positives:- Unique menu, peaks your interest and the fact that they have kimchi on several items made me feel like I was going to love the place.- Los Drowned: As far as I can tell the only reason to go to the place, pretty decent sandwich for sure.Negatives:- The food (with the exception of los drowned) was just alright. Burger was overcooked, fries were soggy, everything felt as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp.-The service was a joke, I was looking for a hidden camera. I wouldn't recommend even trying this place in a group over 4, I understand its new and there will be a wait but its not efficiently run at all. Twice the hostess pointed to a 6 top table that was \"ours as soon as it was bussed\" and twice she sat a 3 top in it. To their credit they ultimately moved one of those 3 tops to a smaller table because there was no where else to put our group of 6 (who had been waiting for over an hour). I'm sure that three top will be writing a similar review. Adding insult to injury the food took a long time to come out and the difference between the first entree and the last entree coming out was around 15 minutes. It didn't help that the last entree to come out was my burger. The positive side was I did get to try the \"los drowned\" because the people I went with felt bad for me. Finally when it was time to go the waitress went MIA for 15 minutes after all of our plates had been bussed. \u00a0For a restaurant with such a long wait they don't have much of an effort to get people in and out the door, which I suppose could be the problem to start with.Do yourself a favor and walk a few doors east to Au Cheval.

It's SO bright and airy, just perfect for even a dreary day in the city. The menu is huge, so I definitely need to go back several times.

The batter was light and the pickles had great flavor. I also ordered a Tiramisu milkshake. I really didn't taste any of the familiar tiramisu flavors, but that aside it was an excellent shake with super rich homemade whipped cream. For my lunch entree I ended up with Los Drowned, a fantastic spin on a french dip with deliciously braised beef and a fresh and flavorful medley of toppings. The hoagie roll was perfect, and it made me really curious to check out Little Goat Bread. This woman knows her way around braising meats, as I experienced at Girl & The Goat, so it was a wise choice.

No worries, they told us to come on over and they would get us a table ASAP. \u00a0We walked in, were apologized to right away (I guess they had taken my phone number wrong) and seated. Yay! Crisis averted by excellent service. Executive Summary: Overall I found the service and friendly atmosphere to be as outstanding as at Girl and the Goat. I couldn't have been more satisfied. \u00a0The food and cocktails were good, just not amazing. We tried the Fat Elvis Waffles, Shrimp & Grits,& \u00a0Corn Beef & Hash.

I actually had to leave early because the smell of salt and grease and bad acoustics were making me feel worse. I have to say, I think Chef Izard's personality from watching her seems very warm and full of great energy, but I have never felt that translated into her food. I think the biggest perpetrator is the SALT but also the presentation of the food...just slopped onto the plate with no real artform.

Upon walking in, we were told there would be a 45-60 minute wait for brunch in the diner, which was completely fine. We checked out the bread side, and enjoyed some cider while waiting. The atmosphere was great- lively, bright, and cheerful.Once seated, our server, who was friendly and cheerful in the beginning greeted us, and made some recommendations. We ordered a side of bacon to start, a benedict, and a burrito, and a single pancake to share. We waited for an hour with no food, and the server was nowhere to be found. It was apparent that we were hungry, and unattended, so the manager stopped by to ask if he could get us anything... um, just the food we ordered an hour ago, maybe? He immediately brings us our bacon, which I assume was sitting at the kitchen waiting for some time. It was terrible- dried out, limp. A sorry excuse for bacon. I was expecting something thick and delectable, and what arrived was what appeared to be microwaved oscar meyer bacon. Inedible. Then the mediocre entrees were sent out. We ate them because after waiting to eat for more than two hours, we were hungry and it didn't even matter. Once finished, we waited 20 more minutes, and the pancakes came out. They were not much to speak of, either. Pretty underwhelming. Our server magically appeared to ask how our meal was, completely aware of the extreme disappointment, \u00a0and brought us our bill. They did end up discounting our bill by 20%, which is a nice enough gesture.. but considering that our bill was only $20.00, you'd think they'd just comp it all together since we spent 2 1/2 hours at this place.

Given the buzz surrounding Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard and The Girl and the Goat, and not having eaten her food yet, I had high expectations without knowing what exactly to expect. We didn't have to wait for a table for a party of three. The decor is upscale diner. The booths are padded with comfy dark brown leather; I felt like I was sitting on a well-worn, well-made couch. Drinks anyone? I cannot remember, or find online, the name of my drink but it has vodka and chambord and tastes like a lighter version of a screwdriver. We also ordered The Jazz Singer, which has bourbon in it. My accomplice said it was delicious but on the boozy side. We shared fried pickles and onion rings. They were perfectly done and both the ranch and curry mayo accompanying them were so delicious and addicting that we would have been happy eating them alone. The hash browns were good but a little too greasy and probably the most unmemorable thing I ate there. Entrees: Wing burger with a veggie patty, spiced apple pancakes and the Los Drowned sandwich. My accomplices thoroughly enjoyed the first two. The bite of apple spiced pancakes I had was delicious, a good balance of savory and sweet, much different than your typical, overly sweet local diner pancakes--we barely drizzled any maple syrup on them. The owner of the wing burger could not stop commenting on how yummy the wing sauce was. I was blown away by the perfection on a hoagie roll that is Los Drowned. The beef was perfectly braised and gorgeous. The combination of the avocado, buttercase cheese, pickles and spicy mayo made for a balanced, creamy, flavorful mouthful. The sandwich came with a vinaigrette-like dressing (apple cider, maybe?) that gave it all the sweet, acidic touch it needed to excite my palate with each bite. I think I said \"wow\" after every bite. It was so good I almost cried. I thought about it all day today, I kid you not. Nothing I ate in the last 24-hrs. could compare. It was, hands down, the best sandwich I've eaten in my entire life. We wanted to have dessert but we had nowhere to put it. We shared the complimentary birthday sundae. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and funny. The busboys were on top of things. Our water glasses were never less than half full. Three cocktails, two sides, three entrees. Bill before a generous tip: $87. I would eat here again in a heartbeat. A great place to take off your tie and meet a friend for dinner after work or to impress that special someone. This is easily one of my new favorite restaurants. I can't wait to go back!

I was in the neighborhood and had been meaning to get in there to check it out. I didn't have much time but I figured I could grab a sandwich to go. The place was packed when I walked in and there were quite a few people waiting for tables. I asked the hosts about take-out and they said they don't really do it since it messes up the flow of the kitchen, but I could sit at the counter area and order something to-go there. There was no wait for one person at the counter so I grabbed my seat. I sat down and tried to make my way through the menu and checked out some of the yummy looking dishes that were circulating near-by. A few minutes late, one of the food runners placed a plate of food in front of me! Thanks, but I haven't ordered yet, I said, and he replied that it was a mistake and I could have it if I wanted it. He politely asked if I had any dietary restrictions, and left me with my \"Crumpets with Chorizo and Maple Syrup\" which were a bit too sweet but free so they were great. Soon after, a waitress stopped by and I ordered an expresso from her while I still contemplated ordering something to-go for later, and after she walked away, I never saw her again. The espresso never came, but a \"soup of the day\" was dropped off accidentally again. I again told the food runner that I had not ordered it, and he took it away to sit in the kitchen window, probably to be thrown away. Eventually I finished my crumpets and decided that I had to go. I asked a nice girl who worked there who had been overseeing the events to find a server so I could follow up about the espresso and settle my bill. Moments later a new server came and apologized about the espresso and asked if she could give me one to-go which I declined. She left to print out my bill which she soon discovered I didn't have. She apologized again, and declined my tip so I had a free meal! It did look like things were a bit disorganized coming out of the kitchen, and I noticed things were sitting in the window for an unusually long time but everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves anyways!
