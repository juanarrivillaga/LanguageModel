We went on a double lunch date here with some pals last week and it was good, but not worth the hype. The couple we went with ordered the salmon burger as well as the #5 (bison burger with blueberry bbq sauce). \u00a0They ordered off the segment from Diners drive ins and dives. The bison burger was up to par and was a good burger but we agreed not as good as kumas. The salmon burger was shared by my friend and I and truthfully it was a let down. On triple D, Guy was talking it up and when i got it, it was almost overwhelming fishy and way to strong on the curry aiolli. We both had a few bites but were dissatisfied with how strong the curry was.Our boyfriends enjoyed their burgers (the bison burger and the patty melt). My boyfriend upgraded his patty melt to a double and added a fried egg, and he loved it. The only complaint was the plates were too small for such a messy burger. To my dissatisfaction of my salmon burger, he ordered me the milkshake off the day (a toasted marshmallow milkshake). That was simply the best milkshake of my life. We also got the cheddar fries to share and they were good but just standard merits cheddar with scallions. But they were still good.

They complement the burger really well. \u00a0In my experience, the servers have always been really knowledgeable and helpful in telling you exactly what is on each burger and helping you make a decision.However the below is what keeps me from giving 5 stars:- \u00a0You can't customize your burger really in any way, \u00a0for example I would LOVE lettuce & tomato on the #2, but you can't add it. \u00a0- \u00a0Fries do not come with the burger, you need to pay for them separately. \u00a0This makes the bill so much higher... because who doesn't get fries with a burger? \u00a0Also they come in a really large size when you order them, so a lot of them end up going to waste at the end. \u00a0Anyways, this is probably the best gourmet burger I've ever had, I just wish that for the price that you pay they would give you fries with it and let you somewhat customize the burgers.", "Date": "2014-06-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "J D.", "ReviewID": "UsnGPxgC5NlsdNlk2EdVJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome experience. #4 burger with green chilis, fried egg and bacon on fresh made bun was fantastic.

We stopped by on a Saturday evening at about 8:00pm -- the place was rockin. We waited about 20-30 minutes at the bar and then were seated. The beer list offers terrific options and the bar serves some nice cocktails. The food was excellent and memorable. I had the #1 burger with cheddar, bacon, and BBQ sauce and my gf had the salmon burger. We shared and both were outstanding. We also enjoyed the salt and pepper fries with tasty spicy house ketchup. Price-wise, DMK was moderate. It's not a cheap meal but not crazy expensive either. Our meal of two burgers, fries, and a round of beer was under $50 with tip. The only downside of the evening was the service, which was a bit slow. We waited for another round of beers for too long, so that's what keeps this review from being 5 stars.We'll likely return and would definitely recommend DMK Burger Bar to other foodies that love a great burger and a lively ambiance.", "Date": "2014-05-25", "Author_Location": "Aurora, IL"}, {"Author": "Chris V.", "ReviewID": "7vPGezg5n3q0o0zAkZ-Ydw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazing burger and great fries!

My first impression: Shouldn't a burger bar give you a BURGER? \u00a0I mean, you know, a real manly half-pound minimum burger. DMK gives you--spitballing here--a one-third pound burger that doesn't exactly hide but certainly doesn't dominate the sandwich. If I want a pussy boy burger, I'd go to a pussy boy burger place. Gimme a goddam BURGER.On top of that, DMK deploys one of my least-favorite restaurant practices in the whole world: They sell soft drinks by the can in a waiter-service restaurant and charge you for each one. That's crap. If I want to overpay for soft drinks at a restaurant, I'll go to, like, Brazzaz where they sell 8-ounce bottles for $3 a piece while I chomp on an endless supply of intentionally over-salted meat.Oh, right.

Or that I live nearby in Lakeview. \u00a0Slightly afraid to admit to the nice staff that I actually live in Hyde Park, approximately 63 minutes away on CTA. There's a reason why I keep coming back to dine at this fabulous establishment. Correction, multiple reasons. I have never tried a burger here that I wasn't thrilled with. I was given the recommendation to come here by a good friend of mine. He joined their softball team at one point because he visited there often enough. (This makes me feel slightly better about how often I'm here...)This most recent visit, I had the #1. The burger is topped with aged cheddar, smoked bacon, charred balsamic, red onions & Rufus Teague's BBQ sauce. Amazing. I admit, I am particularly fond of good BBQ sauce. The Rufus Teague's variation knocked my socks off. Combining the sweet aspects of the sauce with the savory flavors of the smoked bacon is brilliant. As far as cheddar cheese goes, the aged cheddar was delightfully melted and provided a necessary sharpness to the toppings of the burger. The red onions were saut\u00e9ed and complimented the rest of the toppings well, although beware, you may end up with a couple in your lap if you aren't careful.. Other burger recommendations include the #11 which features a lamb patty and the #4, a classic combination of fried egg & bacon atop a savory burger. But honestly, you can't go wrong with any of the options. My friend (who was experiencing DMK for the first time) went with the #4 and had difficulty controlling the yolk while eating the burger. (Side note, she is in the need of a cowboy from Texas who can bridle both the fried egg on her burger and her wild, untamed heart)Now onto even more reasons why I basically live here: the sides. As a friend remarked during lunch on Sunday, the burgers get you in the door but the fries keep you coming back. My friends and I split three different sides on this visit. The sea salt & black pepper fries are great and come with the house ketchup. The sweet potato fries come with a lemon tobasco aioli which is delicious. Combining the bitter citrus taste of lemon with the richness of the sweet potatoes is bizarre but amazing. The fried okra and pickles side is also fantastic and is the perfect addition to a scrumptious burger. Overall, I love DMK Burger Bar. It's a great, casually-hip restaurant that I always recommend to friends when they are in Chicago. Definitely worth the trip.

It honestly kind of just tasted like something I could have made at home, with a patty out of the freezer section of Jewel. The bun was seriously sad and the burger itself wasn't anything to write home about. It was still good, but don't think I'd go back for another.I also tried to sweet potato fries, which typically I don't like sweet potato fries, but there were definitely great (I would go back just for the fries, not the burgers). Also tried the Parmesan truffle fries, equally as amazing. Unfortunately, all of their fries are made with some type of beef fat or beef butter (as we were told by the waitress, thanks for the head's up) but I figured I'd give them a try anyway. My stomach revolted later that night because of that (maybe I won't be going back for the fries then).Overall, this really is just meant for meat eaters.

My mom and sister were visiting me and we had all just attended a story slam not too far away. To our excitement, my \"sandbox sistah\" and I were chosen as judges of the stories during The Moth, and used all of our energy and brain power to score semi-mediocre and not-so-clean stories (sadly, The Moth in Chicago doesn't compare to its counterpart in New York). We were starving and decided to reward ourselves with some good eats, and luckily, DMK was still open. \u00a0Before my sister's arrival, we had compiled a Google Doc of all the places we had wanted to try. However, DMK was a spontaneous destination, and it did not disappoint. We were immediately seated, and our waitress was amazingly nice. She recommended her favorite burgers and gave us a short blurb about each one - #4 and #6 were her favorites, but she continued to go on and on about DMK's veggie burger #12. Veggie burger? At a place known for its grass-fed beef? I was perplexed. \u00a0We went ahead and ordered the #6 (sans the chorizo) with guac, Sonoma Jack cheese, chipotle aioli, cilantro, and onions and the #12 veggie burger with aged cheddar, eggplant, tomato, and pesto mayo. Both were delicious!! The patty is thin, but definitely high quality. Although I'm a huge fan of thick, juicy patties, these DMK patties were still pretty good, but I still would have preferred a thicker patty. However, what really makes the burger good is the combination of toppings/ingredients. Everything went together so well and the flavors were delicious. Do not underestimate this veggie burger! Even my carnivore sister couldn't get enough of it. \u00a0 We also ordered a side of mac & cheese #1 and parmesan & truffle cream fries. The mac & cheese was AMAZING!! Great combination of aged cheddar and parmesan and a great crust on top that adds some texture. It's definitely really rich, but if you're a mac & cheese fan, don't pass this up. BUT THAT TRUFFLE CREAM. OMG. When it came out, my traditional mom didn't know what was happening. White ketchup? Is this like when Heinz tried to make green ketchup? But once my mom tried it, she was basically eating it plain. It was that good. \u00a0Finally, to finish off our meal, some lovely gentleman at the bar bought everyone a small sample of their pecan pie milkshake! Was this the equivalent of getting bought a drink at da klub? Since my mom was present, I'm glad the drink was sans alcohol. And mann, was this a tasty milkshake.

As a good friend describes it, I'm a \"recovering vegetarian.\" I had a few meals at home but decided it was time to reintroduce my dining self to meat. DMK looked like the perfect place.The burgers, grass-fed and antibiotic-free, come in many varieties, as do the fries, and the milkshakes, and so on. I started things right with the Number 5 -- Bison, goat cheese, and blueberry BBQ sauce. HOLY. SHIT. My taste buds were so happy with me. I do not know if words can describe the wonderful combination of flavors. Nor will I try. But I will recommend getting the Number 5.I returned a few weeks later and tried the Number 4 (again with Bison, even though it normally is ground beef; what can I say? I'm sticking with the original) -- Roasted green chilies, a fried egg, jack cheese, and smoked bacon. HOLY. SHIT. AGAIN. Let's just say I have at least 12 more visits to go (there are that many normal options, plus specials!! Sweet Lord.)Add to that the tasty music playing not-too-loudly in the background, some DAMN tasty sweet potato fries (the lemon aioli that comes with is spectacular), and a very chill atmosphere, and you've got one of my new favorite places.

The sides are great to split and I had a hard time keeping my hands out of the fried onions and sweet potatoes sides we split. Incredible. My burger itself was juicy, perfectly cooked and flavorful, the bun wonderfully soft and the toppings fresh. In my Butcher and the Burger review, I tried to compare it to DMK, and I couldn't.

I saw good reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. It's a bit far from downtown, but very close to the subway. This place is literally all about burgers. Their menu is very small. Fries are separate from the burgers, just a FYI. I guess it's so you can focus all your attention on the burger. They have lots of burgers, so it was kind of hard to decide which one to eat.I ended up getting the special which was Santa (something). I don't remember. But it was salsa, egg and tortilla chips. It was very unique and very good. HUGE burger with very moist meat, grilled to perfection. THe only thing that was disappointing, which I know would be really hard to perfect was the fact my tortilla chips were soggy. I know, that's just being really picky, but the sides that didn't soak up the sauce were very crispy, so it left a nice sensation in my mouth. My friend ordered the double stack. It was HUGE! He had a messy time eating it. But definitely worth it. My other friend ordered the regular. Still a very big burger, but also grilled to perfection. We ordered sweet potato tots to share. Those were really good. Very sweet potatoes and very crispy. Usually sweet potato fries aren't as crispy as you'd get with regular fries, but these tots were super crispy. The sauce it came with was also really good. My friend ordered the choco banana milkshake. SO GOOD. If I had more room in my stomach, I probably would have gotten one myself. Very banana-y flavour and good hint of chocolate. VERY thick milkshake, I used a spoon to take some from my friend's drink. Hahaha. Great place for burgers and milkshakes.

We had a 45 minute wait to get seated, but it was a beautiful Saturday night, so we stood outside and kibitzed with our good friends. The staff actually did a nice job getting us seated in a timely manner considering how packed they were.

I decided to stray from their normal menu and try something different. \u00a0Being a True, Blue Cubs fan, I had to go with the special burger of the month which was the Ron Santo Burger. It was their standard burger covered with Pastrami and provolone cheese. The price for most of their burgers range from 8-11 dollars. For that price you would expect a nice chunk of meat, but I was I was amazed by how small these burgers were. Not only were these burgers as thin as a anorexic on a hunger strike, they lacked any type of flavor. The Pastrami and the over-sized bun completely overshadowed any flavor the burger had. To be honest, the Parmesan truffle fries, beer and good service were the best things about our visit. The burger was a afterthought. Seriously people, Where's the beef!!!

I don't drink a lot of soda, and this was a nice change of pace from the canned crap.I waited and Kiley came over and asked me if I wanted to order anything to nibble on before my friend arrived. Ok, twist my arm. I got the parmesan fries with truffle cream that Caroline M raved about. All I can say is that it's a good thing my friend came when she did as I had a really hard time not eating all those fries. Holy crap were they good! They were crispy and had a generous dusting of parmesan on top and the truffle cream was to die for.Since it was my first time there, I opted to just get the standard burger, with no fancy toppings. I figure that if they can get that right, I'd be back and go with a more adventurous burger.My friend must have been thinking the same thing since she ordered the same.

I have to say I was disappointed that there was no strawberry milkshake option (my personal fave), but this coffee was really a great treat. \u00a0I would go back just for this shake alone, even if the rest of the food was that great.Verdict:Service - ExcellentFood quality - Quite goodCost vs. Value - Quite goodI don't know that I'd be willing to wait an hour for this kind of meal again, but I would be wrong in saying that this wasn't a great experience. \u00a0The burgers, a mere $8 each, are conceived well and the flavors blend nicely. \u00a0Unfortunately, this place was more of a yuppie/business bar for people last night than an actual burger bar feel. \u00a0It just seemed people were here more to be seen, than to actually enjoy the meal.Room for improvement? \u00a0Ask how customers want their burgers? \u00a0With MK and Mortons at helm, I have no doubt a rare burger would have been phenomenal here... but they do they all to a medium or medium rare across the board.4.5 stars (if only I could give it on Yelp) for being a phenomenal burger joint, but the crown of burger places still belongs to another for now.Congrats on the successful opening! \u00a0Can't wait to come back for more...", "Date": "2009-11-13", "Author_Location": "Woodridge, IL"}, {"Author": "Michael G.", "ReviewID": "N3aGNln4jjAfdDlIu-9uWw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are only a few skills that I picked up in student government back in college that I still use on a regular basis. \u00a0One is the ability to eat like the wind and still enjoy the taste of food. \u00a0Running late for a relaxing facial (how ironic is that?), I got to put this skill of high-stress power eating to good use at DMK.It appeared to me that, ordinarily, DMK would be extremely relaxing. \u00a0The dark interior and large tables from which easy banter floated to me at the bar seemed a counterpoint to my one-man burger eating contest. \u00a0The beer list said to me, \"stop and enjoy our huge selection of American craft beers.\" \u00a0But my watch said, \"enjoy your water and like it.\" \u00a0Or maybe that was just my inner voice (hopefully). \u00a0Either way, I have to say that DMK was an excellent enabler and my burger was out before I could even check my phone to do my first time check.The veggie burger I got stands on its own as meal - which was good because this place is a-la-carte and I didn't have a lot of extra money (though a Foursquare check-in is good for a free small fry of any sort here). \u00a0It was sort of a mixture between a fake meat patty and a loose veggie one. \u00a0It crumbles to the point where a fork is necessary, but I was actually able to eat it like a meat burger despite the speed I was engulfing it. \u00a0Or maybe it was helped by that fact. \u00a0And the flavors were rich. \u00a0From the cheese to the chick peas, each ingredient made for excitement in my mouth. \u00a0It was one of the best veggie burgers I've had in Chicago.My disappointment actually came with the fries (because who doesn't love a side of disappointment?). \u00a0I got the sea salt and pepper variety. \u00a0It's not one of their signature specialty fries, per se, but I figured it's the old standby so they would do them right. \u00a0They were flavorless. \u00a0I tried adding the ketchup that came with them. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0I asked for mustard. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0They even supplied me with Dijon mustard. \u00a0Fancy nothing. \u00a0They were free for me as I mentioned, but had they been the normal $2, it would raised my ire to the point where I would have really needed the neck massage I was about to receive up the street.I would definitely come back when I had some time to sample the beers. \u00a0But as far as this review (which I think took longer to write than it did to dine there) I'm just giving it an \"a-o.k.\" (and not just because it's the fastest rating to write).", "Date": "2010-09-03", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Liz W.", "ReviewID": "dQf9sV7KN22pTvbhGr45YA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Burgers, tasty fries and great beers.

The burgers are the thickness of what you would get at like Steak and Shake, BUT for $8. Dayuuuuuum. You don't get a side with that either. Just a really thin burger on a chewy dense bun. I got the #6: Marinated Portobello, Blue Brie, Griddled Scallions, Dijonnaise. The scallions were whole and weren't easy to bite into. I took those off. The brie, did not complement the dijionnaise at all. I tasted nothing out of the ordinary with the portobellos for them to have been marinated. And then the burger was so non-existent.

But the result of said walk is that I pass right by DMK Burger Bar. DMK's been at the back of my mind for some time, but it hasn't been in the front of my mind enough to make a special trip. But here I am with a 12:15 appointment, which means I'm out by 1, which means lunch is served.I walk in, and I like DMK. It's a little dark, and it's a little loud, but it's pretty laid back and welcoming, which is what you want a burger bar to be. First, for the bar: terrific. Nice selection of beers, a couple of big TVs, but since it's not a game day, they're playing \"A Bug's Life.\" Interesting. It's a seat yourself place, but it doesn't seem like a seat yourself place, but the bartender catches my eye and gives me the drill, so we're all good.The tables are set with menus, and drink menus, knife and fork setups. The flatware is wrapped in what appear to be bar towels, which sets you up for a messy experience. The menus are angled, which sets up a nice tension. I like the attention to detail.I end up going with the bison burger, because it's highlighted on the menu and it sounds interesting. I'm torn between fries and the fried okra and pickles, but the server tells me she's a fan of the fried vegs, so I get them. When the food comes out, I get both the pickles and the fries -- parm fries with truffle cream. The server tells me she wanted me to try the fries, and they're on the house, so that's a bonus.So the food, which is what you came here for. The fried pickles and okra are excellent. Light crispy batter that doesn't overwhelm. Side of ranch, which works well. The fries are good, but the parm doesn't really work. It's shredded parm and not really integrated with the fries, so it's like a plate of fries wearing a cheese wig. The size of the order is perfect, though. An order for one is 2 or 3 bucks, so it's easy to get a bunch of these and share. Smart.The burger is good ... but. It's a bison burger, with blue cheese, pickled red onions, and blueberry bbq sauce. The cheese is virtually nonexistent. The sauce is a schmear. Not even a schmear. Now I don't need my burger drippings with goo, but the toppings are there to set off the burger, and my toppings set off for another burger bar.I'm gonna use the K word here.

Not because Kuma's is so much better -- I'm not a fan of Kuma's, whose burgers *are* drippings with goo. But because they're not even trying to do the same thing. Yes, they both serve beer and specialty burgers. End of comparison.The lowdown? Three stars because I'll probably be back.

There was nowhere to sit and I wasn't sure if there was a line or not, but it was filled with the denizens of Wrigleyville and beyond.Fortunately for us, we landed a seat right in the back of the restaurant in the corner. It was loud enough that we didn't have to listen to the conversations of the other table although talking took a bit more volume due to the loudness of the whole place. DMK's ceiling renders the place part-dive while the new interior kind of reminded me of Simone's in Pilsen. The server came and took drink orders and came back in time for us to order. We split an order of fried okra while I went with the #1 and my buddy took a #6. The okra came out quickly but I was disappointed by the bite-sized portions. Seriously, it had the resemblance of 10-15 small pieces of the length of a toothpick with the width of a pencil. For $5, we housed through it very quickly and probably would have been better off with a $4 basket of fries seasoned with vinegar and salt.The burgers eventually came and I had a tall grass fed burger with bacon and fried egg.

A highly anticipated place from a respected chef that's right down the street from me AND serves classic cocktails and craft beers? I was in love with the idea of the place. The menu is superb, and the a-la-carte style allows you to easily sample a lot of their offerings in a few visits. I've been in here a few times, the first of which was for lunch on their second day open, a couple of early weekday evenings, and the most recent of which was this past Friday night, so I've seen them operate when it's slow and when it's slammed. Afternoon it clocks in at a solid 4-star spot. Busy...2. Like many restaurants opting for larger communal tables instead of the whole hostess-stand-and-small-table thing, it's often a bit confusing upon entering. On a busy Friday, I saw quite a few different parties walk in and stand confused and ungreeted because the hostess was off looking for a party whose table was ready. Our supposed hour wait turned into an hour and 45 minutes as we watched large groups seated quicker than our table for two. Afternoons though, I've always been warmly greeted upon entering. There need to be adjustments made to accommodate the busy times. \u00a0At the bar, like most of Chicago, these folks know their bourbon and classic cocktails. The bartenders are quick and attentive, know their stuff and make solid recommendations. Why do I know about recommendations? Because the last time I was there, they were out of two different kinds of bourbon, yet they were still on the menu board. You know, the menu board made of movable plastic letters that is easily changed to reflect current offerings. They try hard with the beer, but there were a few things that irked this beer nerd. First of all, a farmhouse ale poured in an oversized wine glass/globe shouldn't have a 3-finger head. 2 at most, preferably less. Secondly, if I order a bottled beer (this was at my table on a non-busy day), you should bring the bottle out to the table and pour it there. Don't just bring a glass of beer. That's a no-no in the beer world. As for the food, I can only personally comment on the vegetarian options and sides. Their homemade veggie patty has gotten better since the first time I had it, and for that I commend DMK. Spicy, thick, and (now) correctly sized for the bun, I'm a fan. The stuffed portobello is pretty much just a fried shroom. The breading is a bit thick - the outer edges are just fried breading that's a bit bland. The middle of the burger was much better just because the mushroom made up for the over-breading. Otherwise, the portobello was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender, and well enhanced by the tomato and arugula. Now, when things got busy, I don't know what happened back there. The roommate ordered the burger with bacon and an egg on it. It came out with a single strip of bacon. Huh? The fries here are solid, especially at $2 for a small plate. I've had the sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and classic salt and pepper, all of which were fresh and crisp. When it was slower, the lemon tobasco aioli that comes with the sweet potato fries was pretty good. I thought it was a bit light on the lemon, but my lovely dining partner thought it was a bit heavy. Either way, decent. But during a busy dinner hour with my buddy (who was there for the first time) it amounted to nothing more than mayonnaise. Seriously. Thinking it was a bad cup, the server brought another one. Same stuff...no bueno. Perhaps I'm being a bit picky, but Michael Kornick and David Morton are respected professionals and the bar gets set a bit higher. After my sub-par experience, DMK actually responded to my Twitter post. I'm glad they're paying attention, and I'm confident they will not be content with average reviews, even if the restaurant remains full.

The sides are all alacart. Thus, your meal can get pricey fast. The servers were down to earth and chill, and our waters were refilled right away.

Out of the FOURTEEN burgers they offer, only one...ONE can be enjoyed as a veggie burger. The rest are straight up beef or portabello. I really do not understand the principle of not being able to sub out any other burger for a veggie patty. Kumas: 1, DMK: 0.So, okay, whatever. If the veggie burger rules, then 1 is enough, right? Well, the burgers seem cheap enough ($8) but don't include anything. As we were drooling over french fry options our waitress informed us that those...as well...were not vegetarian. They were fried in some sort of meat by product and thus, our only option was onion straws. Alright. So, I have one burger choice and one side choice? Kumas: 2, DMK: 0.The food came out MEGA fast. Way faster than Kumas and we didn't have a wait, either. Kumas: 2, DMK: 1. The onion straws were just fine. I piled some on top of my burger. The rest were a big greasy plate of them that I'm not that stoked about as a side dish, but ate them anyway. The burger itself was decent. Very very chocked full of veggies. My boyfriend enjoyed his more than I did.Atmosphere was nice, I liked all of the exposed brick. I was a bit weirded out (after working in the service industry for the past 3 years) at the roll ups being basically sani-towels used to mop up messes around the restaurant by staff. Of course they were clean, but when I get an attachment to a restaurant item as one thing then it is used as another...strange.Overall, I was terribly underwhelmed, especially after spending $40 for lunch.

It gave me Burger Blue Balls and I had to eat at Portillo's the next day just to get my mind right.....So when I went here I was already biased but willing to take the chance and see what everyone was talking about. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 THOUGHTS:1. $8 for a burger - This shit better be fucking good. A Burger is an American tradition made for the common man with discarded beef parts that were ground up and served on a bun since their broke ass couldn't afford a steak. So I order a #8 which by all purpose is there to be the \"regular\" burger.Bun, Lettuce, Cheese, Burger, Pickles, Onions, Mayo.The burger is thinner than your index finger and some how they under cooked it but I was down to go with the flow and I gave it a chance. I house the thing in about :35 seconds since it was kind of small and for $8 I was expecting a \"Pub Style\" burger and got a greasy griddle fried burger that reminded me of a play-doh burger my daughter would make. I'm about 6'4 215lbs so I knew right away I was going to walk away hungery from this motherfucker right here, but whatever...I also got a soda and it was in a can and cost $1.75 which is hilarious. My soda did include a pint glass filled with ice so that must have been worth the extra price since the water we got was room temp and served without ice....Interesting.What is funny was my wife and I also ordered mac and cheese and we were worried that we ordered too much food (thinking that the Burger was going to be filling) and that just wasn't the case.(she doesn't eat Red Meat or Pork so she got the Veggie Burger but that disaster is a whole 'nother review all together!!)We wanted sweet potato fries but if you don't eat red meat be aware that the fries are cooked in a beef grease. \u00a0Not a surprise since I had a ton of grease on my dish....it was kind of amazing actually, how such a thin insufficient amount of meat could drip that much grease on my plate.Overall I think the place will do well since it is like \"one of those places\" that everyone talks about ..... then you realize these people have no fucking clue about what good shit is.So it is basically not a REAL AMERICAN BURGER place its a presumptuous wannabe hipster burger place that gets talked about way too much for what it is. I have had better burgers pretty much everywhere else I have ever eaten in my life. I guess after hearing so fucking much about this place I was going to hate it, but they really sealed the deal when I \u00a0actually sat down and eat here.Pros: Right off the Brown LineCons: Not a real dudes place for a burgerWould I go back : neverWould I recommend this place: NoFinal thought:Seriously go to Portillo's if you like this place and see if you ever go back, plus you will save a couple bucks in the process.

At the time I was coming down with a cold, so I chose to go non-alcoholic, something that was difficult to do after reading their expansive beer list.

It did taste sort of fresh I suppose, but it didn't taste better than Sprite. So who cares? $3 for a glass? Should have been better.All their burgers are $8. I ordered a lamb burger. It was fine, but too soft and falling apart for my preference. Maybe that's how ground lamb is I don't know, but I guess I should have asked for a firmer meat. It was ok, but it wasn't better than a Whopper. It was worth maybe $4, but not 8. The bun was fresh, but it was flimsy with no flavor or texture. Why bother? It's only been 2 days, but I can't really remember anything else about the burger. Maybe that says how bland an impression it made on me. I'm not going to complain about it, but I'm not going to praise it either.They have 5 types of french fries for $3 or $5 depending on size. I got there after the Sweet Potato fries were eaten, I heard they were good. I shared parts of the Wisconsin Cheddar fries and a couple other fries. I can't remember their names either, because they weren't that special. The Cheddar was too heavy without a real cheddar taste. It could have been stadium nacho cheese for all I care, it didn't hit me as strong cheddar. It was also too pooled at the bottom so the top/sides had no cheese and the bottom fries were drowned. Also, all the fries were too oily/greasy for my taste. I like crispy fries, which still resemble potato rather than oil-soaked shoe laces. OK, it wasn't as bad as that, but they weren't crispy even when fresh. The other two orders of fries came with some sort of zesty ketchup, but WAY too little for the amount of fries. Don't skimp on the special sauce!!!Overall, I paid $18 before tax/tip for a burger, some fries, and a glass of pop. Think to yourself how good it would have to be to be worth that much to you. Well, it wasn't worth nearly that much to me. I feel like I was paying for the OPTION of drinking alcohol more than for the quality of the food I ACTUALLY ate. And the \"atmosphere\" which I feel could be attained by dimming the lights in my own house. I'm not trying to knock the place, but come on, $18 for mediocre-at-best food?

I got the aoli on the side, because I'm not the biggest sweets fan, but after tasting it, I could see how it would rock the socks off someone. The burger itself was much thinner than I had grown used to at places like Kuma's, but it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I loved my burger. I ate half without feeling stuffed or still hungry.

Let's discuss each in turn. \u00a0If it's the first possibility then that's truly unfortunate. \u00a0If the Counter can cook a medium rare burger, why can't DMK? \u00a0It's about a focus on food safety training, trusting your supply chain and taking the same reasonable precautions that seem to work for the other burger specialists. \u00a0If it's the second possibility it seems very out of tune with the current environment. \u00a0Being guest friendly is critical for ongoing survival in the current recession. \u00a0Lastly, if it's about ease for the kitchen then it's a case of misaligned priorities. \u00a0 \u00a0I had the burger with onion strings - \"medium plus.\" \u00a0The bartender claimed that the burger would still be juicy. \u00a0Usually when I am at a place that will only cook to medium or better (Denny's for example) \u00a0I just order something else. \u00a0However, there's not a lot to choose from at DMK if you don't want a burger so with trepidation I ordered the burger with onion strings. \u00a0 As I feared 'medium plus' \u00a0turned out to be well done, dry and tasteless. \u00a0Grass fed beef tends to have \u00a0lower fat content than the standard product; this makes if far more sensitive to overcooking, not less. \u00a0 Okay, what I liked was the roll; not too bready and an excellent choice. \u00a0The homemade ketchup and the blue cheese fries were pretty good. \u00a0House cut fries are often tough to execute consistently and are often limp. \u00a0These were reasonably crispy. \u00a0The mac and cheese was okay but a little disappointing given MK's resume. \u00a0 Maybe it's unfair, but given his resume, I would have expected more. \u00a0 The beer list was okay, although skewed towards the national 'semi-crafts' (Fat Tire, Goose Island) \u00a0but that's a personal preference. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0We sat at the bar and were waited on by a good bartender with a fast smile and fast hands (a bad thing in front of the bar - a good thing behind the bar!). \u00a0I could see him cringe when I ordered my burger 'medium-rare' but he doggedly rolled out the \"we only cook to medium plus but it will still be juicy...\" line, as he has no doubt been trained. \u00a0I sort of felt bad for him. \u00a0DMK is a beautiful room and is well put together. \u00a0 Needless to say it was hopping and loud. \u00a0 Lot's of hard surfaces make it loud but that is no doubt intentional on the part of the design team, to give the room an energy. \u00a0Most restaurants make mistakes; it's how you recover from them that matters. \u00a0They have a great team and the concept works. \u00a0They want to do only a few things and do them well. \u00a0From an industry perspective, burgers are on a tear - look at the headsnapping growth of 'better burger' concepts such as 5 Guys and Smash Burger. \u00a0In full service operations, chains such as the Counter continue to grow despite some misteps. \u00a0 I wish the team at DMK luck and I would give them another chance if they rethink their decision to overcook their burgers for reasons of their own. \u00a0I gave them two stars for the concept, but as another reviewer said, an overcooked burger is a deal-breaker if the name of your restaurant isn't Denny's or Burger King.", "Date": "2009-12-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ritu R.", "ReviewID": "VNa4BkEShe-vsoILFiWvMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a fan!

The no reservations policy kind of sucks, but we didn't have to wait TOO long, so we didn't mind. Plus on a warmer evening, it's nice to wait outside and chat with your friends. When we were seated, the waitress was great. One of my friends was debating between her normal cocktail of choice and a new, more exotic looking one. The waitress recommended the exotic cocktail, and my friend agreed to order it. Unfortunately, she didn't like it, and only took a few sips. The waitress, without even asking, promptly brought over the cocktail that my friend was originally going to order, and said with an apologetic smile, \"I noticed you weren't really liking your drink, so I got you what you originally wanted, and it's on the house!\" After my friend thanked her, the waitress came back AGAIN with a complimentary order of fries because \"they're so delicious, you guys have to try them!\" We were blown away by her friendliness and attentiveness! The second time I went the service was good, nothing spectacular though.Atmosphere:Very loud. Not a good spot for an intimate date. With a group it's fun though! Also dark, but it didn't bother me at all. Very trendy, and basically just screams that the place is a good time!Price:Being a broke college student, I reserve DMK for a treat....it's kind of on the pricy side. Most burgers are $9, beers around $6-$8, fries $2-$5. And yes, it's true, the burgers do not come with fries. Kind of sucks, but the fries are worth the extra few bucks. Also get a large and share with your group! Burgers are a little small for the price, but you have to consider the atmosphere and service...not the mention the pure deliciousness. Expensive?

Dropping the names of Michael Kornick (chef owner of MK) and David Morton (of Morton's The Steakhouse fame) and mentioned the plethora of craft beers and we were set. Arrived around 7ish and were told it would be an hour wait. Not bad especially since it was the third night open. The location is in Lakeview right by the Wellington stop for the brown line and parking was okay to find. Inside was exposed brick and dim lighting filled with yuppies galore. Not a bad thing really.. It just wasn't as casual as I thought. Being told by Michael Kornick that our wait wasn't long was a nice touch. The hostesses were really friendly as well and the wait wasn't bad at all considering all of us had a beer while we waited.So craft beers were good. I think I had the Two Brothers Cain and Abel Red Rye Beer, Derrick T. had the Left Hand Milk Stout and Akash S. had a draft beer. We all enjoyed our beers. I especially enjoyed how the alcohol hit me as I didn't eat for a while beforehand.So we were all seated and picked our food. Not to make Derrick T.'s review redundant as we had some of everyone's burger (and also because Derrick T. is a little more detailed) I will just mention my burger. I had the #4 with the green chiles, fried egg, and bacon. Really good, but I think if I let my burger sit a little more the egg would of made the bun too soggy. The bun itself was nicely toasted and the meat was nicely prepared. I think the beef is grass-fed which had a different texture and taste, but was good. I would of wished it was a little juicier if I could of changed something. Maybe increase the fat content a wee bit? Of course we had sides too! Ordered two small fries and the first mac and cheese. For the fries we had the parmesan truffle and the sweet potato. Both were good. The sweet potato fries though didn't stand out from sweet potato fries from other places. The sauce it came with though was impressive. Just like other rave reviews for the truffle fries, I would have to say they were outstanding. The sauce with those were unbelievable. If only there was more room in all of our guts I wouldn't of minded getting a large order of that. The mac and cheese.. well it's good. Not the best I've had, but really good. I liked the crust on top of it and appreciated how it didn't feel too rich like other places, but I kind of wanted that gluttony. Really well made though.Watching the bears game here made us realize that two tv's at the bar isn't enough. I do understand that the people there weren't watching the game and that the crowd might not really care to watch a game while there, but it would of been nice for few more tv's so we could watch a game and enjoy our food. We all ended up walking over to Sheffield's after to finish the game.Overall, really good burgers. I wouldn't say like Kuma's, as they feel worlds apart (not just crowds and noise level), but really good. Kumas is more meat and well rock n' roll for their food while DMK is a more refined take on the classic burger/sides.

This is quite a problem and causes lines which is sort of a pain. The the big thing that happened that was a bit disturbing. DMK was advertising their NYE party tickets for $50/$75 depending if you wanted a table or standing room. All advertisement and discussions with staff indicated these prices.

Agitation leads to poor reviews, but the food speaks for itself. Got the Holy Guac-Aioli Burger... Wow this was by far the best burger I've had from DMK. A juicy grass fed burger with chorizo, guacamole, sonoma jack cheese, chipotle aioli, cilantro, and onions. \u00a0Loved the chorizo and was not overpowering. Kind of a delicious sloppy joe on top of my burger.I usually get the #4 (with Roasted Hatch Green Chile, Fried Farm Egg, Sonoma Jack Cheese, Smoked Bacon)... I'm such a sucker for a fried egg on a burger but every single time I hate how messy this can get. Never again after discovering the Guac-Aioli burger! I HATE that they're $10-$11 for JUST the burger and no sides. I could eat like 3 of these. It's easy to rack up a big bill if you get a burger, fries, beer, milkshake, etc. Fries are decent. The Wisconsin cheddar and scallion is very underwhelming, I would rather get ball park fries to tell you the truth. The Parmesan, Truffle Cream fries are pretty good. The Truffle cream dipping sauce is really good. I prefer the sweet potato fries with lemon tabasco aioli. Atmosphere is great for friends or for a date. The seating is a bit close and we could hear the couple next to us arguing. Kinda weird but it's dark and intimate and the bar is fun.

Anyways, my boyfriend and I walked in and there was a guy standing at a dining table to our left. He looked at us for a few seconds, and we looked at him. He finally asked us how many, and that's when we realized he was the host. Mmmkay. Our waitress was much friendlier and professional. She explained the menu to us, made some recommendations, always had our drinks filled, and the food got to us super fast. I got the #6 burger, which was topped with marinated portobellos, blue brie, grilled scallions, and dijonnaise. My boyfriend got the #8, which comes with all of your basic burger toppings. I was pleasantly surprised at the patty-- thin, uneven, dare I say... like Steak 'n Shake's patties. I love the hulk patties at Kuma's but I really feel like that's comparing apples and oranges. The plus side to DMK's patties is that they make eating a whole burger feasible for me (please don't judge me. I normally have the eating habits of a morbidly obese man but something about burgers fill me up fast). My burger was pretty dang awesome. I'm fan of the ciabatta bun. As a rule, I love everything that was piled on it. It was also SUPER buttery and juicy, and when is buttery bad? Well, unfortunately I think that the butter took the salt content over the top. Mushrooms were salty, brie was super salty, and the dijonnaise was salty. The burger was delicious, yes, but it was making my mouth pucker it was so salty. My boyfriend said his was a little less salty. We also got the salt and pepper fries, which were tasty.Would I do it again? Probably.

We all had a variety of burgers - bison, lamb, etc..- and we all agreed the burgers didn't stand out above others in the city. If you want a true burger experience, there's this place called Kuma's.I get it, we're at a bar...a bar. So it's cut and dry, nothing fancy. But they shell out this image that it's fancy, and the burgers weren't. I will give points on the fries though. Those were great. This is a place you go to watch a game, meet with friends, and drink...maybe order fries, and only a burger when you're trashed. Seriously, DMK, market yourself as a trendy sports bar.", "Date": "2011-12-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mike K.", "ReviewID": "dpywQKfY7469d5X0okcVrw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We were here on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was very long - longer than we were quoted.

Their shakes are nicely thick without an overbearing chocolate richness, which lets the bourbon shine through. Burgers, except for specials, are only $9, but you have to get fries separately. We had the truffle fries which were the best I've ever had. The truffle was not cloying or fake-tasting, the fries were crispy on the outside and pillowy in the center, and the sauce was understated. The deviled eggs were way too salty. The burgers were delicious and well-cooked. The only one I would not get was (I believe) the turkey burger, which my friend had. It had so many strong flavors that my mouth and tongue hurt. My other friend had the portobello burger which she really enjoyed.

I REALLY like beef and I REALLY like a good burger, so this place was calling my name!One of my favorite burger places in the city is Hamburger Mary's, not because their burgers are particularly high quality, but because they're so creatively prepared. DMK, however, gives H. Mary's a run for its money, without having to go all out with their preparation (or the showmanship of female impersonators... or should I say show-womanship?)The beef at DMK is from GRASS FED cows, and if you're a more sophisticated meat eater, you might notice the difference in taste. It's distinctly more earthy, but also a bit richer or bolder. They don't season it much, which is a big distinction between their burgers and the burgers at H. Mary's. It's also something I really like! (I should add that the way H. Mary's prepare their burgers DOES actually enhance, as oppose to mask, the flavor of the meat, but it's great to get such good flavor, as you do at DMK, from the beef itself!)I believe fries are generally overrated, but also, I simply don't like fried food very much (anymore). I didn't order any fries, but I did order a greek salad, which was perfect.BTW, my burger was the number 4. It had on it some roasted green chiles (from a place called Hatch, in New Mexico), a fried farm egg, sonoma jack cheese, and two thickish, yet short, strips of bacon.I may not like fried food, but I will have a SMALL bite of bacon. These two strips of bacon, however, were a bit too thick for my liking. I guess if I were to have eaten the bacon on my burger, it would have been fine. But I got the bacon on the side, and only ate a SMALL bite off one piece. That was MORE than enough.I had a couple of glasses of a Pinot Noir too, which was very juicy, and went fine with my burger.The interior of DMK is set up like a bar; tables along the wall and a bar with stools, and a seating large area in the back, nicely arranged in a lofty, and loud, space with TVs near the bar and plenty of room to walk throughout.

Coming from the suburbs, the chances of finding a gourmet burger spot is slim to none. After hearing about DMK a few friends and I decided to try it out late one night after spending the day in the city. We got there a little past dinner rush, but it was surprisingly empty, even the bar area. First off, great service. Workers are super friendly and chill; no, not the fake friendly like you get at Chick-fil-A either.Secondly, the fries are legit. We started out with a small order of Sea Salt & Black Pepper fries, just to make sure their most basic fries were worth it. ON POINT. Then we upped the ante to the Sweet Potato Fries with Lemon Tobasco Aioli. Again, ON POINT. Talk about the perfect combo of sweet, sour, with a slight touch of spiciness. My personal favorite was the Parmesan fries with Truffle Cream. \u00a0DMK does not fake the funk with the fries.Now, for the few times that I've been to DMK (about 6-8 times), I've gotten a burger on about 4 of those occasions and I've had the same burger every time. It is the #3: NY Pastrami, French Gruyere, Sauerkraut, and Leroy's Remoulade with, of course, the grass-fed beef patty. Flavor. Flavor. Flavor. And Pastrami AND a beefy patty? YES. The option to add a fried egg, adding to the flavor and juiciness of the burger, is always welcome. I can't say much about the other burgers, of which there are 8 more options with a beef patty and 5 more that are either turkey, lamb, salmon or veggie, but I do hear the Portobellow (#13) is just as flavorful as any beef patty burger. Mind you, the burgers are not \"Kuma\" sized but they're not sliders either. I'd say a perfect, medium sized burger, and defintely not over/underwhelming.After stuffing yourself with burgers and fries, what would you consider washing all that down with? Water? Sure. A coke? Why not? But there, down at the very bottom of the menu were 3 words that made my first DMK experience as memorable as it ever was: PEANUT. BUTTER. SHAKE. 3 words so simple, yet so interesting. What was so special about the PB shake, you may ask. All I can say is, imagine PB Cap'n Crunch, but in the form of a shake. yeah. Yeah. YEAH. That's right. It's THAT good, ehem, THAT GREAT. After the first, I had to try another. Yep, 2 Peanut Butter Shakes. It's what keeps me coming back to DMK.All in all, my first DMK experience was great to say the least. Great service, complimented with great burgers, fries, and the greatest peanut butter shake you could ever have. Luckily, DMK made it's way out to the suburbs in the ever-so-evolving Lombard/Oak Brook, area not too far away from me. The atmosphere at the Lombard location is totally different from the Lakeview one. Service isn't as good, but the food and drink certainly is.

Even though the restaurant is relaxed and casual, its commitment to using organic and grass-fed ingredients is second to none.First and foremost, the burgers are made with Tallgrass Beef. \u00a0Tallgrass Beef is completely grass-fed and grass-finished, meaning that the cows are never fed grain. We have yet to find another restaurant in Chicago that only uses grass-fed beef in their menu items. This sets DMK apart from the competition.The rest of the ingredients are grass-fed, and in many cases also organic. Their bison meat comes from the North American Bison Co-op, an association of ranchers whose animals have never been fed hormones and thrive on a diet of natural, free-range grazing. DMK sources organic lamb from Black Earth Meats in Wisconsin. This farm is also certified by Animal Welfare Approved, an independent organization that certifies for excellent humane husbandry practices.The cheddar cheese that tops the burgers and fries is from Otter Creek Organic Farm and the turkey burgers are made from Golden Legacy Organic turkey. Otter Creek emphasizes rotational grazing and pasture-based living for their organic cows when the weather is hospitable. Eggs come from Milo's Organic Poultry. \u00a0In a recent report by the Cornucopia Institute, Milo's Organic Poultry provides ample outdoor space and encourages their birds to go outside. \u00a0According to the report, the farm offers the birds an excellent outdoor environment, often either rotated pasture or well-managed outdoor runs.If there is one area where DMK could improve, it would be to list their sources (brands and farms) on their website. \u00a0DMK Burger Bar should be very proud of their success in procuring and using grass-fed beef and other humanely raised products.

One would expect some flair for a $9 burger, but the small saucer could barely hold the sandwich. My companion David Gutowsky had the fried pickles, which I will recommend.One of the rules of thumb about a restaurant is that if it is loud with talking the food probably isn't the best, otherwise peoples' mouths would be full, eating. The first thing that strikes you about this place when you walk in, is how very loud it is inside.

While burgers don't come with fries, $4 gets you a huge plate of the sweet potato fries (my personal favorite) among other options, which is plenty for 2-3 people.

Atmosphere doesn't really factor into my food consuming decisions so we went. I got the #4 burger, green chiles, egg, jack cheese and bacon. I asked to get it medium rare since I figured a place like this has good quality beef. I was a little disappointed to find out that all burgers are cooked the same-it kind of reminded me of the pretentiousness at this place in LA. I was surprised though to find the burger tasty juicy with the the chile being subtly spicy, not a kick per se but a little knee that mixed with the slightly medium egg and bacon. Kind of like a really kick ass breakfast with a burger in it.I ordered the salt and pepper fries, Scott got the Parmesan fries. Scott's garlic parmesan fries were the definite winner here but it was my mistake to get plain fries really. Their house made ketchup though was good, tangy but not overly sweet.I started out non-alcoholic with their blood-orange soda which was interesting. I saw our bartender Lauren make house made syrup with a seltzer and mixed-a little new school flavor with old fashioned technique.I definitely need to write about Lauren, our bartender. She was really friendly, knew her bourbon- she was even a member of the Bourbon Heritage Society, gave us a free order of sweet potato fries when my buddy and I decided on getting other fries. Not only that but my friend Scott was reluctant to get an order of bourbon and I started calling my Stacy and Stephanie and Jocelyn. Lauren even jumped in on it and Scotty's reluctance turned into, less reluctance and he got a glass of Elijah Craig with me-again a suggestion from Lauren and an excellent one.

DMK had been recommended by friends as a place a burger lover like me should definitely try. After previously suffering through two lousy recommendations (J. Wellington's and Longman & Eagle) I did not have high hope for DMK.We sat and examined the menu in the straightforward dining room. A lot of pre-built burgers. The Saturday special was the Bison burger with goat cheese. My girlfriend opted for the special to satiate her love of goat cheese and I, the purist, went with the #8 medium, which is a cheeseburger with American, LTMO. We also split an order of the cheddar and scallion fries.The burgers here are wide, smashed patties cooked on a griddle and served atop brioche-style rolls. The tell tale signs of a smashed patty are the irregular edge shape, flatter proportions, and a good crunchy crust. This is also the preferred cooking method of my holy grail of burgers, the Shack Double from Shake Shack.We got our food shortly with little fanfare. The burgers were served on small plates and looked deceptively big. I bit into mine and it gushed. The inside was pink throughout, almost medium rare. But with a patty this thin, the difference between rare and well could be only 30 seconds or so. The toppings were fresh and the cheese was perfectly melted. The beef had a good subtle beefiness about it, but was missing some of the more pronounced sirloin flavor the Shack Double has.Did I say this burger was juicy? I ended up with a plateful of grease and the roll was falling apart. I will give kudos to DMK for using a less bready version of the seemingly ubiquitous brioche, which would have sucked up a lot of the excess juice. However, had they toasted the inside of those buns, I think the roll would have stayed intact. Also, cutting back on the amount of fat in the beef blend would allow them cut fat an introduce more robust beef flavors.The bison burger did not seem to suffer the fat issues of the regular beef patty. However, the amount of goat cheese was overpowering. A little goes a long way. All in all it was good, but not as good as the bison burger from Bluebird on N Damen.We left pleasantly surprised with DMK. So far, it was the best burger we have had in the city.

Wait was about 20 minutes which was totally acceptable. Our waitress was fantastic and was able to keep up with my friends occasional inappropriate humor. She even participated in the boys' brainstorm of a bacon-ranch soup...Appetizers/Sides:We ordered the fried pickles to start - honestly, can you really go wrong with fried pickles [answer: NO]?! We then ordered three kinds of fries for the table to have with dinner [sweet potato, blue cheese and bacon, and truffle]. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the sweet potato fries...one of my friends wanted to drink the truffle sauce so I think those were also a hit.Burgers: I ordered the bison burger and was very pleased. The burgers are the perfect size to be able to order a few other sides on the menu [which is really how it should be done at a place like this]. It came with goat cheese, pickled red onions, and blueberry bbq sauce. To be honest, blueberry bbq sauce made me a bit uncomfortable so I asked for it on the side just in case. I was worried it would be much too sweet especially when paired with the picked onions - not so. I ended up adding it back on the burger after the first bite and then even dipping the burger in for extras.Overall, everyone enjoyed their burgers. Beware: the number 2 apparently has a bit of a kick to it...as does the number 1 [according to my fellow diners]. The lamb burger was also given a thumbs up, but I cannot speak to it personally since I didn't have it.Desert: For some unknown reason, we thought we had room for desert so a peanut butter shake and an ice cream sandwich was ordered. Beware: the peanut butter shake has a LOT of peanut butter in it. Still delish, but very heavy. There are two types of ice cream sandwiches and we opted for the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Solid ice cream sandwich.Fun extra:Someone asked [jokingly] about the deviled eggs. We didn't order any but the waitress sent some out for us on the house - SO GOOD! If for some reason you have a craving...definitely recommend them.

My burger was absolutely delicious- the meat just melted in your mouth and wasn't at all overwhelmed by the toppings. \u00a0I managed to snag a bite of two of my friends burgers- one with marinated portabella mushrooms (good but nothing to sing about) and the other with bacon & barbecue sauce (the sauce was really great- I'd order this one again if I can ever tear myself away from the Lamb Burger). \u00a0We all agreed that the Lamb Burger was the best on the table.We also ordered three kinds of fries: the original seasoned fries with house-made ketchup, the sweet potato fries, and the truffle oil fries. \u00a0The original & truffle oil fries were not crispy enough and we didn't really enjoy them. Everyone gobbled up the sweet-potato fries however, they were perfectly crisp and were served with a lemon aioli sauce.To top it all of was a short espresso milk shake. \u00a0I ate it all, I didn't want to share, and I could have ordered another. \u00a0There were crunchy bits in it- maybe chocolate covered coffee beans? \u00a0If you are a coffee lover like I am, order this one. \u00a0It's only $3 and the perfect size if you're drinking it alone.One more thing: about the crowd. \u00a0When we went last Thursday night around 6pm, our party of four was seated pretty quickly. \u00a0Last night I returned (around 8pm) to revisit the Lamb Burger I had been dreaming about all weekend, and another couple walked in right behind us. \u00a0There was a bit of a crowd waiting with drinks at the bar, and David Morton, who I recognized from my earlier visit, walked straight up to the other couple and sat them, totally ignoring me and my friend. \u00a0I was a little pissed off, until I looked at the couple and realized it was Alpana Singh from Check Please. \u00a0Minor Chicago Celebrity sighting!! \u00a0I'll give 'em that one, but when he returned and told us it would be a 35 minute wait, we decided to pass. \u00a0Go early to avoid the crowds!So there you have it: \u00a05 stars for delicious burgers, shakes, and sweet potato fries- they make up for the crowds and the soggy truffle fries.", "Date": "2009-11-18", "Author_Location": "West Lafayette, IN"}, {"Author": "Marne O.", "ReviewID": "ugoWaA_TjtbjbC1kHNWxLw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My friends and I tried to go to Kuma's while I visited Chicago but the wait was 2 hrs!

It comes baked in a little dish with a hard crust on top. I like the one with grilled onions on the bottom. Even the salads are good.Whatever you do, don't forget to order fries for the table.

DMK is definitely a hipper joint with good tunes playing continuously and the menu is straight forward with good bar options. While Kumas burgers are bigger in size, DMK offers some unique side items that make up for their smaller patties. Deviled eggs being one of those sides and a must to try if you don't mind eggs or reliving childhood memories when the fridge was full of them after Easter, at least in my childhood. Another awesome side that \u00a0I tried was the wasabi coleslaw, so simple and yet the kick in the ass that coleslaw always needed. The fries are great and I swear are made in a non-vegan way by cooking them with some kind of animal fat like Hot Doug fries. Oh, if you couldn't tell by now, this is not a place to start of a diet. My only negative about the place is that you can't choose how you want your burger cooked and no substituted toppings so your forced to choose their custom creations. You can take off toppings though, like leaving the fried egg off since you may have had 3 deviled eggs already.I did give this place a extra star because the green chile they used on the #4 burger comes from Hatch N.M. and if you know about Hatch chile then you know its some of the best tasting green chile.To sum it up, I say give this place a try and if you don't want to wait then go fairly early because they do not take reservations.

The triple deck burger is $11.most french fries comes in $2 single serve or $4 table size.I ordered the #1, bacon, aged cheddar, balsamic vinaigrette sauteed onions and bbq sauce. Upon first bite, the meat and bun were perfect. However, something was really lacking from this bbq bacon cheeseburger. The aged cheddar was barely noticeable. But when you tasted it, it tasted like aged cheese. The bacon strips were two thick, and when you bit into a piece, you couldn't bite through it because it was so thick. The onions failed to offer anything positive to the burger. Onions on a burger is such a simple concept, but by making the onions \"gourmet\" and sauteed in some balsamic vinaigrette made the onions way too sweet in conjunction with the bbq sauce. call me crazy, but i would have loved some large raw onion rings on this burger.My fiance had a \"crispy\" portobello sandiwch. Crispy here means the portobello was battered and deep fried. One bite and you get a myriad of flavors, but you also get a distinct taste of \"deep fried oil\" because the mushroom has so much room to soak up that oil. After a few bites it can be tough to stomach the oily-ness of this sandwich.We tried the salt and pepper seasoned fries with spicy ketchup and the sweet potato fries with lemon aoli. Both were good. The lemon aoli was sweet and surprising. It is one of those things that you don't want to eat on a french fry, but once you dip it, you just want to keep dipping again.The ambiance was too much for us. The music was blaring so loud in the \"bar-like\" atmosphere that we could barely hold a conversation because we were screaming \"what did you say\" at each other all night.the \"house sodas\" I would avoid. I thought a cherry home-made soda would be really great - but it tasted like fizzy cough syrup.

I was in Chicago a couple weeks back and was looking for a place within walking distance of my hotel where I could have something tasty with a couple of good local brews. I stumbled upon DMK burger bar, looked at the beer list and thought \"Not only do they have mid-western brews on tap, but they also have Allagash. Must be good.\" I took a seat at the bar and ordered myself a turkey burger (which came with free fries?!) and started with Half Acre's 'Daisy Cutter Pale Ale', it was hoppy, but not too much that it overpowered my turkey burger. After I finished my turkey burger I had a nice conversation with the bar tender about various craft brews. I was impressed with how knowledgeable he was about craft brews nationwide. After a couple of complimentary samples, I told the bar tender that I wanted to try something else that was local that I would not be able to get on the east coast; he said \"i'll pour you something that i know you will like.\" His pick was Two Brother's 'French Country Ale.' It was rockin'.I went to the Allagash brewery in Portland, ME the following week and since then have been telling every craft beer connoisseur about this new and upcoming brewery out of Warrenville, IL called 'Two Brothers.'

They know how their burgers are supposed to be made, and each one is prepared to the chef's specs. It may be a little arrogant, but the burgers came out perfectly so they obviously deserve to be a little arrogant.We had three kinds of fries on the table - truffle fries, sweet potato, and cheddar.

The beer selection is large and boutiquey. Can't speak to the shakes but who can go wrong with chocolate, peanut butter and ice cream? And its one of few places in Chicago that's paleo friendly. The beef is grass fed and the fries, which are all off the chain, are all fried in beef fat rather than oil. For me, it's a decent choice when I'm tired of cooking at home and for all its boutiquey-ness its actually pretty affordable. But the same things that make DMK good also make it fail to stand out. I mean spit in Chicago and you'll hit at least 5 bars who cater to the craft brew afficiando. And any burger place worth it's salt is going to have a fried egg and bacon burger. DMK tries to distinguish itself with unique pairings and seasonal offerings but to me they pale in comparison to what Kuma's offers on the regular.

I've got the bison burger and the veggie burger. The bison was so juicy and ridiculously flavorful. The veggie burger, hands down the best veggie burger I've had in the city. It has eggplant on it and a spicy kick.The sweet potato fries are SO worth the calories (I know calories shouldn't matter if you're in a burger bar, but still, a calorie is a calorie). The one thing I haven't had yet but looks delicious is the chocolate milkshake. That's next on the list.The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because of the noise level. We sat at a picnic style table across from each other and there were a lot of \"What?\"s and \"What, who?\"s. The wait is a little high (about 30-45 minutes both times I've been), but turn-over is fast -- it's just that it's a popular place. Overall, I rate DMK the highest on my list for a burger in the city at this point.

I'm beginning to notice that this cheese sauce seems to be very popular in the Chicagoland area and it's reminiscent of the cheese \"spread\" in handi-snacks. The jury's still out on whether I like it or not. #1 Burger - (Aged Cheddar, Smoked Bacon, Charred Balsamic Red Onions, BBQ Sauce). Please note that the ingredients list is indicative of a sure-fire winner so you can imagine my dismay upon finding the final product to be only ok. Grass fed beef patty was a bit mushy, and lacking in flavor. Bun was delicious but the burger was a little bit of a disappointment overall. Portabello burger - surprisingly very good. The mushroom was lightly breaded w/ panko crust. The burger had a fantastic balance with the horseradish, arugula, marinated tomatoes, and fontina cheese. Same delicious bun. As I said above, I would absolutely return but I find it difficult to leave Evanston when Edzo's is right around the corner from me.

Sure, it's mostly just burgers on the menu featuring ingredients we're all pretty familiar with, but DMK's philosophy shines like a gold thread through the fabric of their restaurant. I typically review food before finances, but the reasonable price-points at DMK -- for MK-quality ingredients, preparation, and aesthetic -- is the real sell here. What's more, several of their avant-garde cocktails are listed with a high-end and middle-ground spirit choice, depending on your budget. That way, everyone gets to enjoy the craftsmanship of a well-made mixed drink without having to pay $11 for top-shelf booze.Flavor profiles are pleasantly unbefitting a neighborhood that features such culinary and drinking atrocities as Uncle Fatty's Rum Resort (which manages to stay in business despite promoting itself as \"Lakeview's #1 cover band venue\"). Sure, it's burgers, but these are thoughtful burgers -- burgers that defy ketchup (unless it's homemade, seasoned with chipotle peppers, and accompanied by blue cheese and house-made onion strings). For months, the best burger on the menu featured prosciutto and vinegar potato chips -- a righteous combination of flavors and textures. The rest of the burgers (I've had most of them) come with tender, high-rise buns, grass-fed beef, and generous portions of great ingredients. Sides and desserts are great fun, too: The parmesan truffle fries best similar offerings at higher-end restaurants. A more -palatable version of ranch dressing (for the Uncle Fatty's crowd, no doubt) comes with a plate of perfectly fried okra and pickle spears. Really, we haven't had a real miss in terms of sides, and we've nearly tried them all thanks to their generosity: Either we're the most polite or critic-looking folks around, but Daniel and I consistently get offered free sides with our meals. Last night, the gravy fries we debated over getting (choosing instead the creamy, fork-friendly bleu cheese and bacon fries) arrived at our table, on the house. (We liked them, too, but wondered where the rest of the poutinesque accoutrements were?)I give this place my heartiest recommendation.

I've been twice on Sunday nights and have never had to wait to sit down despite a solid crowd.The menu is a one-pager, so not too many tough decisions unless you like decisions, then you might feel limited. There are about a dozen or so burgers on the menu, 3/4 of which are traditional beef and the others range from turkey and lamb to vegetarian options. I've tasted the lamb burger which is treated exactly like gyros, which was kind of cool if you're looking for something non-traditional.The burgers are really the perfect size and most of the flavors on them are pretty rich, so don't be shocked when a Kuma's-like behemoth doesn't show up on your plate. My favorite thing here is the #2 with Amish blue cheese and chili-rubbed onion straws. It also comes with their chipotle ketchup, which is the only ketchup they serve and its really excellent. I would buy it if they packed and sold it there. My absolute favorite thing here is the sweet potato fries with the lemon tobasco aioli. I was told this was the place for parmesean truffle fries, but I found them disappointing and still don't get the truffle oil thing.

Sometimes spots open up in the bar (where they serve their full menu), but generally the wait is long, with nowhere to really sit or hang out, so wear comfy shoes! One thing that I actually really like about this place is that there are often people alone at the bar, drinking a beer and having a burger while watching a game.

No substitutions, but you can take certain things off your burger. I'm generally a beef lover, but I have to say, the veggie burger here is SO GOOD... I probably go about half and half between the veggie burger and a beef burger. The bison burger is also delicious, but of course it is, because there's goat cheese on it. My favorite part of eating here though, is the fries. First of all, I will say, I think the fries here are made to be eaten with the sauce; that is, the flavors don't really work unless you dip each fry into the sauce it comes with. The fries alone are good, but with the sauces, it all comes together. The parmesan truffle fries with truffle aioli are to die for- I crave them all the time. The sweet potato fries with lemon aioli are also really good. Those are my favorites. Mac and cheese is also great, very thick cheese. The prices are very reasonable- $9 for each burger, except the Bison, which I think is $11.

To be completely honest, my first experience at DMK burger was not a positive one. I hated it actually. I went when it first opened and it was a mob scene to get in. After over an hour wait for a table, we had ordered a variety of burgers and pretty much all the fries and sides available. Nothing seemed worth the trouble it was to get seated.After many conversations with other people, and my consistent bitching to their praises, I decided to give DMK another shot. I couldn't be happier that I did. I tend to go elsewhere after I have a bad experience in a restaurant. There's over 10,000 places to eat in the city of Chicago, and I work too hard to throw my money away in any of them. I don't know if the food and service improved after time or the fact that the longest you'll wait to get a table is now 15 minutes since the hype died down, but DMK has been a great go-to place for a burger and a beer after work or on the weekend for lunch.With a pretty good variety of different burgers and fries, you can go back many, many times before you've had everything on the menu. But my biggest pleasure at DMK is their special shakes. Not quite sure when it started but as of last October when they started pushing a special \"October\" pumpkin shake, I've tried to get in there at least once a month for whatever shake is being served. The pumpkin shake is one of the best I EVER had. Packed full of pumpkin flavor and topped with pumpkin seeds it was like pumpkin pie in a glass, I only wish it were available year round. I must have gone in 5 or 6 times for that shake in October, and just when I thought I had the best shake ever made, they introduced the Gingerbread cookie dough shake in December! I'm pretty sure there was crack in it cuz I went back time and time again until New Years Eve. I can't wait to see what 2011 brings.The food is great, the service is friendly and it's not too bad on the wallet either.

During our dining experience, the service was attentive, generous, accommodating, and helpful. I honest to God can't believe I am saying this but, 5 stars for the service.Food. 3 stars. The fries are ridiculously good, best part of the meal hands down. I typically don't enjoy sweet potato fries but these changed my mind. The dipping sauce that accompanies them is fantastic. The onion strings were also a surprise. Very thin, crispy, and tasty. The burgers are average. It is almost like the burgers need more seasoning or something. Even with bacon, a fried egg, and green chilis, my burger was still rather bland. If you are a normal size dude, get a double ($3 extra) or you won't be full. The bun is not a pretzel bun but is an excellent change of pace from it. There are better burgers in the city, without a doubt, especially given the price.Drinks.

As for the fries...if you are familiar with the truffle fries at MK these are very similar and amazing.

They carry Boylan's sodas as well as a few they make themselves. I tried the cherry and blood orange of which the blood orange really stood out.

I will say the wait staff was not the most attentive and service was quite slow, but hopefully that will improve the longer they are open.

There's something gross about the sauce that I just can't put my finger on. It just...doesn't taste very good. (I was also hoping for shredded cheese instead of cheese sauce, but that's my own problem.)- The burgers were dry and too small for the buns. Maybe I've gotten used to other burger joints that serve burgers the size of my head, but each burger I've gotten from DMK has thrown me back to those old BK commercials with the old lady who yells, \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?!\" It could also be compared to what girls experience after they move on from a guy who's really well endowed to a guy who...isn't. Uh. Oh.- Mac and Cheese no. 2: the sauce was grainy, the bacon was overcooked, and there were onions at the bottom of my mac and cheese.

If you glance down below this update, you'll see that I was a fan from nearly two years ago. While DMK had its detractors, I wasn't one of them. I spoke well of them and implored people to give them another chance in the face of bad service and shrunken portions. It looks like the joke was on me.I came here with a large birthday party. Prior to coming, my party called ahead (days in advance) outlined the number of people, needs and expectations. Knowing that DMK doesn't take reservations at all (really not a fan of this trend), I knew it would be a crap shoot. I also expected, however, that the management would speak openly and honestly about realistic wait times with that number of people (in their experience) and whether or not the restaurant could, realistically, handle that kind of crush. If so, cool. If not, no worries. They could handle it. Wait time would be approx. 30-45 min, provided our party arrive at the set time.Getting a bunch of [redecated] folks to arrive anywhere en masse on time is nothing short of a Christmas miracle but wonder of wonders, it happened! We arrived on time, told the hostess we were here and bellied up to the bar to get some drinks. I settled on a sweet tea cocktail that was disappointingly weak. Adding insult to injury, I was overcharged for it before I addressed the matter with the bartender. She 'forgot.' Mhm. I guess she also 'forgot' how to add any liquor to it as well. Things were not starting off well. Our party was big and a few other large parties wandered in as well. The place was uncomfortably crowded and hot. What ever could rectify this situation? Oh, right. Reservations. Anyhoo, 50 minutes passed and I went to get the hostess to check on our table. She was going to \"look into it.' 15 more minutes passed. Still looking. After ten more minutes, she informed me that part of the section she was to place us at had four folks sitting there. They'd already paid and finished, but they were having a conversation? Really? On a busy Saturday night after satisfying the bill and finishing the meal, it's a good idea to keep a large party waiting for a half hour longer than expected (1 hr, 15 min wait so far) so people can take up real estate and not turn over to new paying customers?Huh? I wanted to leave but I was there for a birthday and that wasn't my call. Fifty minutes later (that's right, over two hours of waiting... at DMK... after calling ahead days in advance and discussing needs and expectations), we were sat. My appetite was gone. We received an order of onion strings and pickles for our troubles. That sounds nice before you take into account the size our of party. Not once did the management ever come up to us to apologize or explain the situation, despite us asking for them. Not once. Unacceptable. On the way to the rest room to wash my hands, I nearly slipped and busted my bodacious butt. Neither here nor there but it happened and added to my frustration. My #4 (turkey) tasted like a Bob Evans sausage patty and my draft beer was served in a stemless wine glass, rather than a pint glass. Huh? I got a wine pour-sized beer for draft prices? Ugh. Whatever, at this point. I was done. I'd been done for a while (hours, actually and literally) but I was definitely *done* now.With as much money as we threw down at DMK, I didn't feel accommodated or taken care of at all. In fact, I felt unappreciated and unwanted. My money was taken (full price, y'all) but no consideration was given. The night was frustrating but moreover, it was disappointing.

There was a 15 minute wait or so. \u00a0Michael Kormick himself was handling the list.-The attitude level of the place is a notch or two too high. \u00a0The music is so loud it gave me a headache in the 15 minutes we were waiting for a table. \u00a0The sound system is obviously over-designed with speakers literally every 2' along the ceiling perimeter. \u00a0So of course, if the music in one area is too loud it's too loud everywhere. \u00a0The place was packed and people were probably having to scream to be heard, which made it even worse. \u00a0During some songs the music was soft and perfect, but some others it was so loud I couldn't hear anything unless I stuck my head halfway across the table. \u00a0-The napkins they use were bar towels, but apparently not washed enough...

Yes! DMK Burger Bar. Your burgers and service were a great beginning to a great Sunday night.On a late Sunday evening some coworkers and I had a hankering for some good burgers. But what burger joint is open late on a Sunday night? DMK is and is open everyday until 12am for us late night burger cravers. This burger bar is dimly lit with a clean and modern fa\u00e7ade. The interior is fresh with a great creative feel far beyond any traditional burger joint. The beer menu is extensive and the burger menu looks simple, but with everything from a bison burger to a homemade veggie and grain burger it is sure to please every palate. Upon being seated promptly in a giant party table in the middle of the dinning room we quickly ordered our drinks with the courteous and cute server. We ordered margaritas and some Goose Island Sofia served in interesting stemless beer glasses. I guess without the stem our hands will slightly warm the beer to release some of the beer's nuances? The margaritas were great. With a great mix of El Jimador, Triple Sec, citrus and Lagunitas Pilsner (Pilsner? you heard me right) all round this great margarita.We all ordered burgers as well. I ordered the Hatch Green Chile, Fried Farm Egg, Sonoma Jack, Smoked Bacon Burger and the Fried Okra & Dill Pickles served with Herbed Ranch. The burger was cooked perfectly with slightly piquant smoky chiles, jack cheese, smoked bacon all topped with an over easy fried egg. Deliciousness. All this goodness was served between a dinky bun. What gives? I understand the burger and accoutrement are really the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, but I feel the bun is lacking. The Fried Okra and Dill Pickle were really great. Crispy and well seasoned chicken fried pieces of pickle and okra served with a great ranch dipping sauce. There were a lot more pickles than okra, but that was fine with me. I love pickles. I finished the meal with the Gringo Michelada; PBR, fresh lime, spiced tomato juice with salt rim. All served a la carte so you get to mix each ingredient at your leisure.The overall meal and service was really great. Although it was nearly closing time I felt we were all treated with utmost respect and care.

The first thing we noticed is, that although very friendly, the our wait person seemed a bit naive. We ordered a Northshore vodka martini, dry with a twist.

We were not charged for them because we complained, but others my not have such luck. To be fair, the beer selection was extensive.On to the food. For a starter, the fried pickles and okra. We got maybe eight pickles and 2 pieces of okra. The flavor was good with a good dipping sauce and crispy crust. We both ordered the burger with green chili and a fried egg. The meat is grass fed and was tasty but the patty was probably 6 oz at best. \u00a0We ordered the parmesan fries with truffle cream dipping sauce. \u00a0The sauce was great but the fries were limp.Now I understand that this is a newly opened restaurant and there are usually a few bugs to work out, but Michael Kornick is a pro and I guess we expected more.PS this place is also way to hetero.

I have lived in Chicago less than a month and I am already familiar with Michael Kornick's reputation in the food industry. I haven't been to any of his other restaurants, but based on DMK I certainly plan to! The space is great; not overstated, but sleek and hip. It's a place I would hang out just to drink their fine beer selection. I sat at the bar and I like a bartender who is informative and knowledgeable. I'm interested in local brews and I asked Matt about them and he walked me through their beer selection and told me about a lot of the breweries; I love that kind of thing. Well done Matt! He even gave me a couple sample tastes. And a card to get a free draft on my next visit. Now that's how customer service should be done. I went to DMK on National Cheeseburger Day (forreals); I figured what better day than NCD to check out a new (to me) burger joint. I love lamb burgers, and I love Greek gyros so when I saw the lamb burger with grass-fed Lamb, sheep's milk feta, olive tapenade, Greek salad, and tzatziki I was sold! Wow, the bun was exceptional; it was soft and warm and thankfully not huge. The burger was juicy, cooked perfectly and so fresh tasting. The Greek condiments were outstanding and flavorful (a little less feta though, it can be overpowering). I also ordered the sweet potato fries with lemon Tabasco aioli - shut the front door - that's a great combo! Again, it was a small, normal person sized order. I appreciate this; quality over quantity. Don't get me wrong, you will be full after a burger and fries here, it's just not that ridiculous size Americans have wrongfully become accustomed to in recent years.

Sulky about life a little and needed a little pick me up. Luckily, I had three friends that were able to join me for that pick me up. I had been wanting to try this place, (um hello burgers, fries and malts... um yum?), and everyone in the group was good to go and try this place out. Sweet. Day is looking a little better already.I saunter in, first to arrive which meant first to get a table. The place at 1pm was pretty hopping. The tables were full, the patrons were munching away, no one with a nasty face on, sounds promising. The girls serving, (if there are any male servers here, I apologize, I just didn't see any.), were very friendly and upbeat. Not one with a smile \u00a0on their face. They said a few minutes for my table of four. While I waited, one member of my party showed up and a minute later we were sat. As we chatted and waited for the others, I scanned the menu. As others have said, I see no point to tease me with unknown burgers. Teasing me in to coming back? Hmmm you are setting the bar high doing it that way. The burgers better be phenom if you are teasing me with combos that I can't get already. When the rest of the foursome showed up we chatted some more before we got down to business. The menu, (besides the unknown burgers), is pretty straight forward. You choice of burger, you can sub for turkey or veggie, (I did turkey for mine), also you can add a fried egg, plenty of choice for sides from mac and cheese, fries to salads.I went southwestern on mine with cheese and chilies and slightly healthy with turkey. I got a large order of the fries with Parmesan and truffle dipping sauce. I really like some of the combo's they have for their fires and mac and cheese. If I had more room, perhaps I would have asked if those around me wanted to share and got a side. In the end I liked my turkey burger, but wasn't super excited about it. It was good, not too dry, but it didn't blow my mind. I feel like they need to take the extra step and push the limits a little more. The bun was good, soft and homemade feel, but there is that little extra kick I think it could use. The fries were really good with the truffle dipping sauce, they were hard to resist. They also come on these small plates, barely bigger than the burger itself. Why? I don't know. I still ask this question to this very day. I know you are getting just the burger, but its nice to have just a little extra room. I do like the ala cart system and how you can separate everything, burgers here, fries or mac and cheese, which ever, and its not all on the same plate. I did notice strangely that they never asked how the burger wanted to be cooked for the beef burgers my friends ordered. Strange. For a place so highly prized on their burgers and how well they separate everything, I would think they would also want to make sure they customer got everything they wanted just right. In the end, I wouldn't fuss about coming here again. The service was great, up beat, friendly and helpful. The sight of the place was interesting, blending dark woodsy feel with a modern twists here and there and over by the bar. The prices are fine. They have a good selection of items for sides, more than I can choose for one sitting, but really, if I was craving a burger I don't know if I would be running back to this place for it. Considering there are so many places in the city with a good burger, I don't know if I would rank this one high on the list.

As a result, she put our name ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST after we checked in this second time; rather than (as is customary for a party that is incomplete when called at any other place that doesn't seat incomplete parties) putting us at the next 4-top available after the rest of our guests arrived.

So I've been trying to avoid mentioning it to my friends, in case they go nuts and drag me here. I mean, how good can a burger get?

Their burgers don't come with fries, and some don't even come with lettuce and tomatoes, so we ordered a plate of sweet potatoes fries and Iceberg Wedge to share. The food came out momentarily. At first look, I was slightly disappointed with my burger. It looked rather empty - the brie and mushroom were both on the skimpy side (but I guess that's normally how they do it). And then I took a bite and Ooooh Emmm Geee I died! That thing was perhaps one of the best things I've ever eaten. The meat was well seasoned, tender and juicy enough. Their buns are not too crisp, not too stale. The cheese and mushroom were just perfect!!! Everything blended together sooooo well. I mean, how good can a burger be, right? NO ---- NOT right. A burger at DMK can seriously destroy your hope to give up meat; it can temp your boyfriend to not be a gentlemen and compete with you for the left over; it can cause you to tear up when he win; it can cause insomnia; and in my case, all of the above happened!

You can't really go wrong with that combination and it was a perfect way to end our delicious meal. \u00a0 If I am in the mood for a good burger and fries, I would be back at DMK.", "Date": "2010-02-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Lupe d.", "ReviewID": "tLDmHJbctpOu2fLMM6QIkw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was hoping to like DMK, I really was. \u00a0I was looking forward to this visit and since we were in the neighborhood, decided to drop in for lunch. \u00a0I maxed out the meter because I thought for sure it was going to take a while to cook these burgers.. \u00a0I had the #1 Cheddar/Bacon/BBQ/Balsamic glazed Onions, and my BF had the #4 Green Chile, Egg, Jack cheese, bacon. \u00a0We ordered some Gravy Fries and Cheddar fries as sides. \u00a0We were a little baffled at the \"triple\" burger listed on the menu, and I asked my BF if he wanted to pay the extra $$ for a double. \u00a0He said he didn't think he could handle a double. \u00a0At this point I figured we would be waiting a loooong time.... within less than 10 minutes our orders arrived - no lie. \u00a0When I looked at the size of of the patty, I was really disappointed - and I am not a big meat eater, but I guess my expectations were more on the Kuma's side that the Burger King side, especially when all the burgers were $8, not including sides. \u00a0So I tried to move past that and dug in... I will say, that despite the thin-ness (is that a word?) of the patty, the taste of the overall burger was pretty good - now keep in mind that includes the cheese, bacon sauce, onions, yummy bread (i liked the bread soft and warm)...but for the first time I wanted MORE meat because I didn't really taste the beef, I tasted everything else - again I don't even really like red meat. \u00a0 \u00a0My BF really liked his burger, but also commented that he wished he had ordered the double. \u00a0The fries were pretty good, I liked the gravy fries more than the cheddar fries, were they worth $4 each...I think the gravy fries were...the jury is still out on the cheddar fries.I can see how throwing alcohol into the mix can make people think that these burgers are divine... we were on the clock, so no alcohol, but I did like their iced-tea...pretty tasty!So why a 3 star? \u00a0Our host and server were very nice and I always appreciate good service! \u00a0Will we return? \u00a0Probably not but I am glad that I tried DMK...good, but not great...IMO.", "Date": "2011-01-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Zach Y.", "ReviewID": "5SYnHH9sMBbcGodFn3x8FA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best most creative burgers I have ever had.

I think Kuma's having the vanguard spot in Chicago is a sad testament to the quality of this city's burger scene. I really enjoy DMK. I've been half a dozen times so far and have never had to wait. The burgers are very good, better than Kuma's in my opinion. The quality of DMK's meat far surpasses the much larger and much more plain burger at Kuma's. The ingredients are paired better, of the four different burgers I've tried, I'ved loved them all. If you feel the patty is too small you can order a double burger, which I've done several times. The decor is a spacious modern industrial that I happen to like. A nice escape from the blaring sludge metal, which I love but can't stand when its distorted and pummeling my ear drums at Kuma's.DMK bills itself as a beer place as well, which I think it falters at. The beer list is OK. Of course its better than an average burger joint, but if beer is a part of your sale, then you should try to impress anyone with anything over a cursory knowledge of beer. Every draught I've had there has tasted watery and underwhelming. I figured it was my own fault for ordering Goose Island there twice. What can I say, I know their beer is awful, outside of Matilda, but I continually give my local brewer the benefit of the doubt. The bottle list is completely what one would expect. It is a spattering of local and the few large national craft brews that Chicago's absurd liquor laws actually allow. So you will find your ubiquitous Allagash White, Dogfish Head 60 minutes, Lagunitas and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.

However I believe that it is just as unfair to have a bad dining experience and waste your hard earned money ....especially in this economy, as well and I certainly feel like people should be made aware of the pros-and cons to make an informed decision based on THEIR tastes.As a few reviewers on here mentioned DMK definitely gets an A for effort. I wanted to love this place largely in part to their quality ingredients and grass fed meats as well as variety of choices for vegetarians, turkey and lamb burger lovers. However that's pretty much where the A grade stops. The AtmosphereYes it was loud and crazy. However that does not bother me as much. I definitely do think that whoever planned the seating in that space should have allowed for more space between the tables. In some areas of the restaurant you sit so close that it's like going to a benihana when it's just you and one other person sitting at an 8 top table. This is something that can be annoying but if the food is good I will eat standing up if I have to. LOLThe FoodNow this is where the problem comes in. The burgers were extremely small, thin, watery, greasy, and I think that you should definitely be able to choose the temp that you would like your burger cooked. Everyone is different so how can you not offer different temperatures to fit your customers needs. Also would be nice if we were told this up front so that perhaps we could go with something else. The burger was not tasty, and very mushy as another reviewer mentioned. The burger buns are huge (Making the burger appear much bigger than it is) but if you are looking for a half pound burger boy have you gone to the wrong place. The side salad (Almost Greek) was very good however I nearly broke my molar biting down on the olives since they were not pitted. Now that really pissed me off and also Who does that!? Oh and the guacamole.......................gross and I can't confirm for certain but it almost tasted fake although it could just be seasoned badly and over processed in their blender..........it was not authentic guac for sure. Which isn't a bad thing because guac is not what they specialize in anyway. Just wanted to give you a heads up.The ServiceThe service was not that great...but with that being said they were very busy. The server seemed annoyed at questions and did not check on us hardly at all. In fact I don't recall even getting a drink refill once.The ExperienceAll in all it was not a good dining experience.

It was very good, but overall it wasn't my favorite burger that I've ever had because the sauce was a tad too sweet for my taste, and although I usually like the balance of sweet and salty, I guess I don't love it on my burger, and the goat cheese is not my favorite component on a burger. However, the bison was cooked perfectly and it was tender and juicy and everything right. The winner of the evening were there amazing sweet potato fries (and we had to get the large portion) served with a lemon ailoli and they were absolutely delicious. Perfectly crispy and the sauce was to die for...I should have just asked for that sauce on my burger. Overall, the place is definitely worth trying, but not my favorite burger ever. However, maybe I'll come back and get some more sides .

After noticing a blurb about it in Bon Appetit magazine (a guaranteed trusted source of food literature) I asked my boyfriend to join me for a Sunday night dinner. LET ME TELL YOU, SON.The beer and wine lists were encyclopedic, but our server was as sweet as pie, and helped us (mostly my indecisive b/f) decide. I mentioned the fact that I was a line cook at a near by restaurant, and she mentioned that we were lucky to have come on a Sunday, because it was industry night. \"Industry night??! Cool, what does that mean?\" I asked.\"Half off everything on the menu, girl!\" She answered.Then, my brain started to really sizzle.The two of us ordered two sides, two beers, two burgers and a milk shake at the end. The total should've been about 60 bucks, and ended up being just over 30 with tax. We could not have ASKED for a better deal. It was mind-blowing. But seriously, the FOOD:*The fries were good, but not stellar on their own. I work at a restaurant that serves really good hand-cut fries, and I know how easy they are to make, so I allow little room for error. I am a fry elitist. The sauces and seasonings were GREAT, but I would like to try a salad or mac 'n' cheese next time. *The burgers were not HUGE, but they had integrity. The meat was so flavorful, all on its own. SO BEEFY and just, real. Loved the burgers, loved allllllllll the combinations of toppings and house-made condiments. I want to try every single one. One claim-to-fame is their grass-fed natural beef, and it's for real. The burger was not as FANCY as I was expecting, but the taste was truly legit.*The milkshake was SPOT ON. We ordered a Vanilla malt, and honestly, it was just perfect. SO good after a meal like that. We could barely walk home, per usual for us, but we didn't even care.*The beer list is ROCKIN'. I would really like to take a beer-y kind of friend with me next time I go, so I could really enjoy it and try some awesome brews. My advice: Go with someone you love who works in the industry (Chef, server, bartender, etc) on a Sunday night after 9pm, which is actually a really cool time to go 'cuz it's not crazy-busy, and ENJOY.

The slaw and ginger has a tangy flavor that compliments the fish very well. I also had the sweet potato fries with lemon tabasco aoili. Delicious!

I would definitely go with the #3 burger (sort of a burger done reuben-style). None of the ingredients over power any of the others, and the potato bun doesn't melt under the weight of the burger which is a major pet peeve of mine. The fries, especially the salt and pepper and the sweet potato, are about the closest to the ambrosia of Zeus that I will ever get, but to go for a truly Olympian endeavor it is definitely in the fried okra and pickles; it's like a dance party on my fungiform papila. Boom. To top it all off, their homemade sodas, which are placed in the afterthought location at the bottom of the menu are also quite awesome, especially the vanilla/ginger, which is what the streams of the Big Rock Candy Mountain must taste like.

Before I get to the food, the service was phenomenal. We sat at the bar for our meal and literally had 3-4 people making sure we had everything we needed, without being overbearing or intrusive. Everyone was really friendly and it was one of those rare times that the service really elevated the meal experience for me, especially for a place that brands itself as a \"Burger Bar\". The food was great from top to bottom. I started with a Caesar salad which had the quality of something I would expect from MKs or another high end restaurant. A whole romaine head with anchovies and a great dressing, it was on par with the version at David Burke's Prime for literally 1/4 the price. As for the two burgers (half of each), I can't choose a favorite. The pastrami with sauerkraut and russian dressing (basically a reuben on top of a burger) was phenomenal. As heavy and greasy as it sounds, the burger (5 oz) manages to be flavorful, juicy and satisfying without being overbearing. If I had to choose a favorite though, the lamb burger would take the slight edge. Basically its a gourmet, upscale version of a gyro. Lamb patty with tatziki sauce and a greek salad (instead of the standard LTO). The bun they used was unusual (in a good way), not your standard burger bun, more like a fresh baked artisinal bread (not sure if it is or not), it was firm enough to keep the burger intact (which is also aided by the thin patty) and had a great texture. \u00a0The fries (parmesan with a truffle based dip) were also a big hit.

Server had to be new because my order was wrong, then we were charged for 3 burgers not 2 (since he had to put in a new order for my correct burger) and didn't catch it till we were on the subway.

Being welcomed by owners David morton and Chef Michael Kormick changed that within the minute. \u00a0Their fleet of the fast paced hard working servers and bartenders are always at your service, no matter how packed it is.With a bar owned by such a reputable pair, the ingredients are no less than top quality. \u00a0Their buns made specially for DMK and delivered fresh daily by Highland Baking Co. \u00a0The meats, cheeses, beer, wine, condiments and produce are second to none.Ok ok, so enough fantasizing, lets get down to business. \u00a0I walk in with my brother, sit down at the bar and order the big red wine. \u00a0It is exactly that. \u00a0A special blend of grapes selected by Michael Kormick. \u00a0(The even bigger is supposed to be available soon. \u00a0It is comparable to a petite syrah, and I hear very good things.) \u00a0Then we order burgers, fries and a caeser romaine salad. I chose the Grass-Fed Lamb burger with sheep's milk feta, olive tapenade, tomato & onion salad, tzatziki. \u00a0All the flavors of the classical greek gyro with a twist and eruption of flavor. \u00a0I can't believe I'm saying this, but it paired perfectly with the wine!My brother ordered the Roasted Hatch Green Chile burger with fried farm egg, sonoma jack cheese, smoked bacon. Along with a chocolate shake. \u00a0The green chile and jack cheese gave off a nice pickled, spicy kick, and was then mellowed out by the smoky bacon.The shake looked like it was prepared with their chocolate ice cream, malt and chocolate syrup. I didn't try it, but my brother seemed to really enjoy it.Now for the french fries. \u00a0We ordered the truffle parmesan fries, and the bacon bleu cheese fries. \u00a0The truffle cream sauce is certainly a winner. Not too tangy and overpowering with parm, can't go wrong with them. \u00a0The bacon and bleu cheese were a nice change. \u00a0The bleu cheese has a mellow sharpness, and was melted over the fries, topped with bacon. \u00a0I mean it's bacon, of course it was good. \u00a0The fries are cut in the standard pomme frites shape, with their skins left on. They are seasoned plentifully with salt and pepper. \u00a0It's the toppings that really make themDay 2. \u00a0I live across the street, and couldn't wait to go back. \u00a0I went their for lunch this time. \u00a0I ordered the big salad with chicken(choice of chicken or imported tuna (the chunk style I believe)), the deviled eggs, and my brother ordered the #1Aged Cheddar, Smoked Bacon charred balsamic red onions, rufus teague's bbq sauce (Michael Kormick's favorite bbq sauce from a place near st. louis) The salad had mixed greens with fennel and artichoke hearts on it as well. \u00a0Just enough to fill me up. \u00a0The deviled eggs are the standard deviled eggs. Good, cheap, nothing special. \u00a0I preferred the prior burger choices over this selection. \u00a0The onions just didn't have as much flavor from the balsamic as I was hoping it would. \u00a0However, the barbeque sauce is a great sweet thick sauce to compliment the bacon and cheddar.The one difference I did notice with these burgers is that the toppings are actually strategically placed on the bottom of the burger, so that it hits your tongue's taste buds accordingly. \u00a0They are not too big, and if you do want them bigger, you can always order a double. \u00a0I will definitely back to try the rest of their selection.", "Date": "2009-11-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "geri s.", "ReviewID": "mkfg_BAkJQZWXsvMnC7-Iw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DMK welcome to Lakeview! \u00a0I am so happy to have you in my neighborhood. \u00a0I feel like you guys did everything right. \u00a0The staff was very attentive and friendly. \u00a0One of the \u00a0owners was on sight hosting. \u00a0How awesome is that? \u00a0The burger selection is amazing. \u00a0The prices are more than reasonable.

I should mention that it just happened to be the Saturday before St. Patrick's Day so it was crazy. Therefore, I won't gripe about the 30 minute wait that led to us eating at the bar instead of waiting even longer for an actual table. But even though it was crazy, it didn't take much effort/cleavage to get the attention of the bartenders (that Whirling Tiger drink on their menu is dangerous and the Lemonade was really good too).Now, about the food. I will admit that I wasn't expecting to enjoy my food all that much because I am generally weary of places that don't let me choose my food options/toppings so I wasn't happy that I could only get the #12 (I don't like portobello mushrooms so I really did have only one veggie option). But OH MY GOD I will never doubt them again! I had a foodgasm of epic proportions. It was so good that a guy came up behind me to ask about my burger - and when The Boy went to the men's room later, he ran into the same guy who said his wife ordered the same thing and loved it also. It was made perfectly with the eggplant being an excellent complement to the texture of the burger and the black pepper and sea salt fries were just what I was looking for. The Boy, a meatatarian if there ever was one, loved his burger also (don't remember what was on it but I think it was the #1) but the cheese on his fries tasted funny (I blame Wisconsin for that). The only problem was that there wasn't more of it (especially the fries - I ended up ordering some additional sweet potato fries and The Boy ordered some additional mac & cheese also).Oh and I should add that The Boy was really happy about the bill, considering how well we ate and drank that night.So thank you DMK Burger Bar for setting me straight and quelling my hardcore craving.

Not usually a fan of turkey burgers but the eggplant and the portobello combo with the blue cheese cole slaw was just heaven. Yes, I've ordered it twice.-The truffle fries and parmesan fries are nothing special...in my humble opinion.-Kitchen Caesar Salad: I felt like Brutus when it came out...my companion and I literally sat there for about 5 minutes trying to figure out why on earth would someone serve a salad like that. Basically, all of your ingredients are served on top of uncut romaine lettuce slices. It was pretty good once we figured out how to tackle it.-Fried okra & pickles: This isn't mama's southern style...the entire vegetable is lightly fried...(no little balls...hee). It was delicious...however, I was sad we got more pickles than okra.-Meat in general: Yes, I've tried my companions' burgers. Delicious. So...good. -Service: Excellent all the time, friendly, and speedy.-Atmosphere: The music is just so damn loud.-Drinks: I'd stick to the beers on draft. My cocktails were either way to sweet or just not what I even remotely expected.-Price: 2/3 beers + 2 burgers + a couple of sides + 20ish% tip = $50ish.Verdict: Honestly, the 4th star is purely for the burgers and good service.

The deviled eggs were ok, mine are better, but it was sad you only got three (think of people sharing!)The mac and cheese was boring, bland, and kind of gross. Almost an afterthought to the menu. They should add some smokey cheese, corn, green onion, tomato, and then it might be something.Our burgers were pretty good. The bread was soft and a nice complement to the burger. The bison burger with pickled onion and blueberry bbq was quite tasty and something I would get again. The lamb was pretty good on first bite, but by the time I finished my half my taste buds were worn out. It was just too much salt, cheese, tzaziki. Just too much. Glad we shared and I only had to eat half. Not sure I could have eaten anymore. Service was competant and nice. I was well-pleased. The thing I didn't like was how the place was designed. Too industrial without having the space to do it. Cold (in temperature). I hate community tables and these were not set up to give a diner enough room if all are occupied. If I wanted to eavesdrop on random conversations I'd sit at the bar. This is a place I'd make a point to bring a 3rd wheel just to get a table. Also, there were like 6 kids running around the place. Not what I expected and just kind of weirded me out. And I also wish they would cook their burgers medium rare.Overall, pretty decent, but I'd probably just want to get take-out and I don't think this food would do well with any time in to-go containers.

Went last Saturday night with the husband and knew there would be a long wait, we were told 1.5 hours. Which was fine cause we were planning to have a few rounds at the bar beforehand. After squeezing our way through the masses of other people waiting/eating at the bar and getting the bartenders attention we finally ordered our drinks. Why on earth would any place staff only two bartenders for the entire restaurant/bar area, especially this place which boasts a great beer/cocktail menu. The rhubarb drink was amazing but I feel like you could spend $50 before you ever felt you were even drinking alcohol. Unless you like mint and liquorice, DO NOT get the mint julep, it was horrible. We got two rounds with a semi decent wait but the third round, it took literally like 22 minutes to order. Finally this a waitress turned bartender saw us and got us our beers quick. Now onto the food. Good thing is that everything comes out quick. We started with fried pickle/okra and #2 macaroni. The friend stuff was really good and the okra seemed pickled. The noodles in the mac were a little over done and needed some salt but we still ate it. Onto the main event, we ordered the blue cheese/chipotle ketchup and the friend egg/bacon burgers. Both were good but I think the fried egg was more unique, if it didn't have as many green chiles, it would have been perfect. The parmesan and truffle fried are to die for, just like MK's. Yes, this is a ton of food for 2 people and we ate everything, even saved room for an ice cream sandwich which is amazing. I'd definitely come back to try the still \"coming soon\" burgers. I would have given a better review had they been better staffed.

I also tried the salt and pepper fries. At first I thought they were hella spicy, but as my girlfriend pointed out, it wasn't the fries that were spicy, it was the ketchup. In order to quell what I thought were spicy fries I was smothering them in what I thought was standard ketchup. Wow. I'm an idiot. But anyways, all in all the food was solid. So solid that there was no room for dessert... Not that I would have eaten them anyway. For the record: vanilla bean ice cream is NOT the same as regular vanilla. It is much, much worse. \u00a0 Drinks and Bartenders: 9/11: The best thing about the drinks are the price. Great beer selection and good cheap wine options.

I went there on Saturday night at 7pm-ish and wait was 30-35 min. The line got even longer around the time when we were seated. The ambiance is nice with dim light and you don't feel that it's overcrowded even though a lot of people are waiting near the door. However, as some people mentioned in the review, the music was loud and it was hard to enjoy the conversation. About the burgers, my boyfriend ordered #2 Chili-Rubbed Onion Strings, Amish Blue, Spicy Chiptole Ketchup and I ordered #11 Grass-fed Lamb, Sheep's Milk Feta, Olive Tapenade, Greek Salad, Tzatziki. The ingredients sounded very good for all the burger options but what disappointed me when I actually tried was that the taste of non-meat portion overwhelmed the meat flavor. Both burgers had the same problem. Particularly, I didn't enjoy the sourness that greek salad and tzatziki had in my lamb burger. \u00a0We also had Wisconsin Cheddar & Scallion fries as a side. Again, the name sounded intriguing but it didn't meet the expectation. They were just soggy fries with melted cheese and scallion on top. Maybe we should have ordered sweet potato fries instead of normal potato fries.They have a wide selection of beer if you are a beer drinker. We didn't get any as we wanted to try one of their shakes.

I was excited to go back with my boyfriend and we did last night. \u00a0This time, I again ordered the veggie burger since it was so awesome the last time. \u00a0I went to order the sweet potato fries because they were my favorite of all the fries we tried. \u00a0That's when the waitress asked me if I was a vegetarian or just trying to be healthy by ordering the veggie burger because the fries were fried in BEEF FAT. \u00a0Ummm, seriously? \u00a0Even McDonald's gave that up in like the 70's, but okay, that's their perogative. \u00a0I was quite bummed and had to order the onion straws which sort of sucked, at least compared to their fries. \u00a0Their onion straws ARE cooked in vegetable oil, so what gives? \u00a0Then I remembered how I ate the damn fries last time and there was no warning about the beef fat. \u00a0Given how many vegetarians are in this town, it wouldn't be hard to put a little description underneath the fries, like 'hey, sorry to disappoint you tremendously, especially if you've eaten these fries before and loved them, but they are fried in beef fat', or something to that effect. \u00a0It's not life and death, but I'm a vegetarian for many reasons and I wouldn't have eaten them if I would have known. \u00a0Lesson learned, I guess. \u00a0Our waitress actually ended up giving us a free dessert, just because she felt bad about it, even though I wasn't exactly stomping my feet, throwing a fit. \u00a0So anyway, vegetarians beware, the next time I go there, they'll probably say surprise, the veggie burger is fried in beef fat too.That issue aside, the place is pretty cool and there's definitely something for everyone. \u00a0The beer list is great, they have a really creative menu and the staff is friendly and attentive.", "Date": "2011-03-30", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Stephen P.", "ReviewID": "Fko2PuYg5vHA0RUk04M5nA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been there several times and everything I have had has been amazing! \u00a0This past weekend I had - what i consider - the best thing i have ever eaten! \u00a0It was a Breakfast burger = heaven on a bun! \u00a0It was a turkey patty with Hash browns, a fried egg bacon and a RIDICULOUS maple syrup aioli! \u00a0This place is ridiculously, insanely delicious!", "Date": "2011-03-30", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Colleen K.", "ReviewID": "hCHTH8HnCLlJNNx30Q72uQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DMK just gets better and better with time.

With 20 minutes to grab a bite, a man who is a bit picky, and Chicago traffic/parking, I had high planned for the entire night to fall apart. DMK Burger Bar saved the entire night...and I am not being dramatic.Entering the burger bar, I was a bit nervous since it looked quite busy. \"Oh great, it'll be at least 25 minutes before we even get our food\" I whispered to my date. But we were both very hungry, and decided to hope it would all work out. We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very knowledgeable and helpful bartender. She picked out a cocktail for me (which was The Summer Passage- DELICIOUS) and I told her we were in a hurry. She smiled and took our order. Me: the turkey burger with tomato, arugula, etc. Man: a burger with a fried egg, guacamole, chorizo, chipotle aioli, and more... I cannot remember the creative name :( my apologies. After we ordered, it was less than a five minute wait before our burgers were staring us in the face!!! How phenomenal!! And let me tell you... No pun intended but HOLY COW, were they delicious! As I was happily working on my phenomenal turkey burger with a homemade bun, I glanced at the signs around the bar, reading \"Beer Sno Cone\" ... WHAT?!? I laughed and said out loud, \"Babe! Look! A beer Sno cone! How cool!\" It was one small comment that's made while happily digesting my burger, and thought nothing of it. That is, until, I had a man delivering a beer sno cone \"on the house\" to my boyfriend and I. Say what?!? I was full of smiles.

It was SO good. On some days burgers are just burgers unless they are huge then they seem much tastier, but this one didn't need to be big to be good, it was just damn good. Then, aside from the food the customer service really did me in. There were at least 3 different people who asked if everything was cool, but never annoying. Also, my friend had ordered his burger without onions but they gave him onions. Just as he pulled the onions out of his burger our waitress saw and asked if he wanted another one. He said it was totally fine he'd just pull them out. About 3 minutes later one of the servers came out with a side of gravy fries on the house. Sometimes you go to a place that you feel really cares about customer service/satisfaction. They don't come around very often especially when they are taverns or burger joints. DMK was everything I had heard about and more. The only things i would say that may be a little negative about this place is that the portions are small which is something that you don't want if you go to a burger joint, but it is well worth the money and also they have an option to \"double size\" the burger. \u00a0The place was small and it was a little cozy but cozy like a place to hang out with friends, not really like to take a chick out on a 1st date.

The burger was cooked about medium which is what I like, but be aware they only cook it this way; no special ordering. No typical lettuce, tomotoes, onion on top and it didnt need it. Only slight complaint was the bun was a bit soggy but I didnt hold it against them. They make their own sodas; we got the lime which was really good, like a homemade sprite but better!

It was very tasty, I couldn't really taste the hamburger, the pastrami overruled it, but it was really good pastrami. The burger Patties are thin but I thought the burger was filling. We also ordered fries for the table. 1 large order of the parm fries with truffle cream and 1 large order of the sweet potato fries (can't remember the sauce).

Thumbs up on the green chili burger, but my vegetarian friend was not impressed with the portabella burger. It is deep fried, so most of the time she just tasted grease and breading. Just because it's not meat doesn't mean you need to deep fry it! I bet it would have been a better burger if they just grilled the mushroom. The beer selection was good, the whole table enjoyed there selections. At $5-8 a bottle I don't think I would have more than 2 beers here. Now the service, it was pretty slow. Waitress would disappear a lot, and we had to ask for water, I hate that! Also I though the water had a weird metallic taste, almost like they got it out from a hose outback.

I would order either of these again. I like the buns DMK uses; they're soft but substantial, far from your conventional tasteless, spongy buns. The burgers aren't thick like Kuma's Corner, but I really enjoyed the crisp exterior achieved on these griddled patties. One friend ordered their cheeseburger with an additional patty and was very happy, but four of us thought our single patty burgers were nicely balanced between bun, meat, and toppings. We shared 3 large orders of fries and demolished them. The Wisconsin cheddar and scallion fries were delicious; however, the parmesan fries with truffle cream and sweet potato fries with lemon tobasco aioli were phenomenal. These fries are probably my favorite fries next to Edzo's Burger Shop (truffle fries and garlic parsley fries) and Longman & Eagle's. We also ordered the fried okra and fried pickles. The batter fell off most of the pieces. Skip. Saturday afternoon the restaurant was packed and started taking names for seating around 12:30pm.

I went with a Russian Imperial Stout that was very good. We were trying to figure out which of the fries to order when I cam up with the only logical choice, order every one of them and take advantage of the small and large portion sizes, and we did. All of the fries were very good, but the best were either the cheese fries (I cant believe it either, I usually don't enjoy cheese fries) or the sweet potato fries, the best sauce was the truffle sauce by far. The only fry I wouldn't order again were the blue cheese fries... they are very very blue cheesy and a bit overwhelming. I only had two or three and they were great, but my palate couldn't handle any more than that. Now onto the center of attention, the burger. I went with the classic burger, but added a fried egg.

But this didn't stop me from writing a review of Kuma's so please read that too. My one complaint about DMK is that they commit one of my huge pet Peeves, and that is serving CANS of Coke instead of a fountain Coke. If I wanted to drink a can of Coke, I would go to Jewel and buy a 12-pack and drink it at home. So DMK if you're reading your Yelp reviews, PLEASE get a fountain soon! Oh yeah, they also have a good beer selection. Well, only six on tap, but many different varities in the bottle. It's one of the few places that serves Grand Teton Sweetgrass beer, which I love.

They really cram people in. I had about a 7 inch space to suck it in and slide in between two small tables to sit in the booth side of the tables that were all lined up next to each other. So, if you're looking for privacy, forget it. I heard every word of both conversations of the tables next to me. But it's quaint. I liked how simple and straight forward the menu was. \u00a0Each burger has a number - #1 - #13, no substitutions. Each one has different ingredients. And each one is $8. Fries are extra- but these aren't just ordinary fries. We're talking parmesan truffle fries, sweet potato fries, sea salt and pepper fries or bacon & blue cheese fries. \u00a0You can order a small or a group order. I thought a small would have been fine to split between 2 people. The larger order will have you just waiting for a gripper. I had a #13 which was a portabella burger (meatless) with arugula, horseradish and marinated tomatoes. It was light and lovely, although I wish I had known the mushroom came fried. I would have preferred to have it grilled, but then there's that \"no substitutions\" rule posted on the menu. Maybe after they get their feet wet they'll be able to handle someone asking for a change. They have a nice beer selection as well. The food came out quickly. Our bill for 3 beers, 2 burgers and 2 small fries was $48. So, not cheap, but not just ordinary burgers either. I'd like to try some of their other selections another time.

The hostess said the wait would be 20-25 minutes, and she would \"find me when my table was ready\". I went to the far end of the bar, ordered a beer, and waited... After about 30 min, I went to check and she said there were still a few names ahead of my party of 2. Very good, the place was thinning out, should be any time, I thought. After about 20 add'l minutes of waiting, I went up again and gave her my name. \u00a0\"Oh, I sent my manager to find you and we thought you left\". Funny, I didn't tell her I was leaving when I checked on my table just shortly prior to that. \u00a0My name was crossed, and they had moved on. \u00a0She got the \"manager\", some 30 year old jackass, who said he looked for me based on a \"visual description by the hostess\". I explained the situation to him, how I had only moved from my spot at the end of the bar twice, both to go to the hostess. After a half-ass apology, he showed us a seat in the middle of a \"community table\", right between 2 larger groups. I had noticed this spot about 30 min prior and told him so. He said \"I've already apologized 6 times, you can either sit down here or leave, and I can try to make this more pleasant\" (he sure didn't sound pleasant, or like he was trying to recover poor customer service). I figured I couldn't give the place a bad review without trying the food. The manager never came back to see how things were, we got sent complimentary deviled eggs and onion straws, a lovely $7 value. \u00a0They were ok. My BBQ burger was thin on a boring bun. The fries were ok. \u00a0Probably the best thing was the spicy onion straws.....I won't be going back, I recommend the counter on diversey instead!", "Date": "2010-05-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}], "RestaurantInfo": {"RestaurantID": "UTMAQluppsu2ZDDaKKZyIQ", "Name": "DMK Burger Bar", "Price": "$$", "RestaurantURL": "/biz/dmk-burger-bar-chicago", "Longitude": " -87.65433099999999", "Address": "2954 N Sheffield AveChicago, IL 60657", "Latitude": " 41.936081999999999", "ImgURL": "//s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vhoo3-7SlR3IccqI4KbcTQ/90s.jpg"}}
