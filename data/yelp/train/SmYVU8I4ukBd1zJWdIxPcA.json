More than enough for 4 people.The sangria pitcher was a little small and the margarita was nothing special.Only 26 each spilt between 4 people including tax and tip so not bad at all!

One of my cousins is vegetarian so we stuck to veggie friendly options so we could all share. We started with the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, so amazingly flavorful and perfectly cooked. I loved the classic tortilla espa\u00f1ol-layered potatoes and veggies and spices cut in a wedge, filling a tasty too. We also got the papas in spicy red sauce, recommended to us by our friendly server. My favorite was the bruschetta with goat cheese and tomato. It was the perfect mix between creamy and crunchy, sweet and salty-love it! You get a lot of bang for you buck here as well. I know some other reviewers were complaining that the tapas were \"too big\" but I disagree. Value-wise, you get a good amount of food for the price you're paying.

Wow - everything was delicious, really good portion sizes, and very reasonable prices.

One of my friends is a vegetarian and there were plenty of choices for her too.We had: ensalada de pimientos asados (roasted peppers), aceitunas alinadas (marinated olives), Patatas Bravas (roasted spicy potatoes), chicken empanada, queso de cabra (goat cheese and tomato sauce), Paella marinara (seafood paella), a scallop dish that was the special, a grilled chicken dish, calamares a la plancha (octopus), manchego stuffed dates wrapped in prosciutto, and 3 pitchers of sangria. Our total was less than $35 each, including tip, and we were all stuffed! Everything was scrumptious. Definitely get the stuffed dates - so good.

They also have one significant addition: their potatoes are actually spicy, which is unlike Spain - where spicy is basically \"added pepper\".

You will not find any $15 tapas plates that has just enough food to feed a new born baby here.Instead, you will find extremely reasonably priced plates ($8-12) consisting of authentic, Spanish comfort food that can actually be shared between a large party of people.I came to Caf\u00e9 Iberico at 6pm on a Saturday with a group of 9, and was shown to our seats in their downstairs section. The upstairs had limited seating, mostly meant for smaller parties and those making a beeline for the bar. The downstairs is much more intimate, and is more accommodating towards large parties.Between the 9 of us, we each ordered a plate and 2 pitchers of Sangria.The Sangria was nothing special, but the food was great. I liked just about everything we got, but my favorites were definitely the grilled mushrooms with garlic and olive oil, beef tenderloin skewer with fries and onions, clams with shallots and parsley, seafood paella (takes a while to make though. ~40 minutes), and saut\u00e9ed chicken breast with green and black olives. But honestly, you can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Do come with a big group so you can all get something different and experience something new. Also, the location is awesome!

We were a BIG group and the restaurant easily accommodated us. Plus, the tapas style of the restaurant made sharing easy and we all got to try a bunch of different items.Since then, I've been back lots of times. I've been with in town friends who have no money. I've been with out of town friends who don't want to spend any money. I've been with my boyfriend, when we have no money. I've been with my sister, because we have no money (do you see the trend here). All of that isn't to say that the only merits of this place are that it's cheap and can hold a lot of people (and this place is huge). However, if you're on a budget, but still want to have a nice time out--go to a restaurant where you can feel like you're spending a good amount of money, but you're not (ha!)--this is a wonderful, solid choice. A couple of must haves: Sangria, half pitcher for one, full pitcher for two (ok, not for real, but hey, it's cheap and delicious), queso de cabra (I have a friend who will fight you for this if you go with her), paella (this is really big), and the octopus with potatoes (polpette con papas?). If it's just me and a friend, I usually get a half pitcher (or full pitcher) of Sangria, one of the paellas, and any of the other items. It's plenty of food and delicious. The atmosphere is great for chatting and catching up, too--especially if you get the paella because it takes close to an hour to make.I have had one experience when the service was rather poor and really should dock a star for it, but can you really be upset that your waiter never came back with water when you needed it ONE time when this is your go to for just about any guest or first timer to Chicago?

I don't like tapas. 2. I don't like over-hyped restaurants.3. The amount of mixed reviews on Yelp. Well, as you can see, my gut feeling was right.We had (and sorry I don't know the actual dish names because I didn't order the food):1. Seafood paella - This was my first paella ever. I was not impressed at all. It tasted like fluffy minute rice meaning there was no flavor, no kick, no life to the dish! 2. Octopus paella (this was on the mini, special menu) - This was tasted worse, like mushy minute rice.3. Spicy potatoes with tomato sauce - I thought it would be like marinara or spaghetti sauce. Boy was I wrong. It tasted like steamed potatoes that were covered in spicy, warm, unsweetened ketchup. Weird. 4. Croquettes - They looked like little mini, pinky finger-sized cheese sticks from the freezer aisle in Costco. I refused to try one because we got only five for $10 (ridiculous!!!) and the general census at the table was that they were not good. They also did not look appetizing.5. Some kind of octopus tapa with fries - It tasted like burnt. That was my first and only impression because I didn't take another bite.6. The ONLY THING I LIKED: the scallop tapa (from the specials of the day, non-menu thing). BUT. They cut the scallops so thin and presented them on steamed, bland, mushy potatoes to LOOK like they were nice, fat pieces of scallop.............7. Sangria - It was good. You can't really mess up sangria though..8. We probably had more, but...my memory fails me, and this review is already too long.This place was SO loud even though there was nobody there when we went in. I couldn't understand a word the waiter said because of the noise and his accent (nothing against that, but the combination didn't help). He also kept rushing us to order and made me feel very anxious because of that.Considering I went to Purple Pig the night before and paid almost the same amount, I would NOT recommend this place...OH I JUST REMEMBERED.

This time he waited for our dessert and served it to us personally. From what I've seen the busboys' would do that for him.

One cold, windy Sunday evening, I decided to play tour guide and take my from-out-of-the country friend to dinner. We ordered half a pitcher of sangria with white wine, queso de cabra, pulpo a la plancha, and almejas en salsa verde. We loved every dish but I particularly enjoyed the baked goat cheese and clams. The baked goat cheese paired well with the basil sauced bread and complimentary bread. The clams were fresh and enticing. I loved the sauce so much that I even dipped my bread in it. With tip and tax, dinner came within $50. My second occasion was for a friend's birthday on a Thursday evening. Our party of five ordered two pitchers of sangria with white wine, avocado and salad dressed with balsamic vinaigrette, pulpo a la plancha, ensalada rusa, croquetas de pollo, gambas al ajillo, raxo adobada, and vieras a la plancha.Now in English terms...my favorites were the avocado and salad, octopus with fries, and chicken and ham croquettes. The avocado and octopus are on the softer end of the flavor invasion. The croquettes were melt-in-your-mouth type of good. But I don't think I would've known it was chicken and ham had I not look at the menu. I loved the ali-oli sauce that it came with! My least favorite dish was the raxo (marinated pork loin). The meat was very thinly sliced and pan-fried to cardboard texture. It lacked flavor and the toughness gave my jaws a good work out. \u00a0Dinner for five with tip and tax came within $135.

But I think later in the evening (we were there before a theater performance) and you'd want to make reservations. At the time we were eating, we were told that they weren't taking any.Started with an ensalata mixta, which was good - I liked the asparagus and hearts of palm for a little variety. From there the olives (which were...olives, right? Not bad, but nothing special about them) and the jamon iberico, which was very good. I love jamon iberico ,and it was served with good manchego cheese on chewy bread.Our patatas bravas were very good, crispy potatoes in outstanding spicy tomato sauce, and corquetas de pollo were good, although not especially flavorful. The pulpo a la plancha was interesting - grilled tasty octopus served with what were basically french fries. I like this, but then, I like the texture of octopus. If you don't, then you might want to avoid. A late addition to the meal was an order of the chorizo y morcilla, which I didn't have much of, but what little I had was tasty.Finally, we had two paella, the iberica and vegetariana. Both were good, in decent portions. The iberica was my favorite, since I love the seafood/sausage/chicken combo, but the vegetable one was also good, with a pretty good mix of veggies that had stayed crisp and weren't cooked to death.Noise level certainly gets high was the evening progresses, I will say that.

The restaurant was spacious, the service friendly & fast, and the food good.* JAMON IBERICO - 3.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Spanish style cured ham with manchego cheese and tomato bread)The tomato spread was tangy and fresh, the bread's crust had a nice crunch but was quite soggy on top. The cheese & ham were placed separately, under the bread, which made this a little more difficult to share with such a big group.* PATATAS BRAVAS - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Spicy potatoes with special tomato sauce)Pretty tasty, but for all the fanfare around this dish, I was a little underwhelmed. The flavors were strong and savory, not so much spicy. My biggest quip with this dish was that the potatoes were not at all crispy! More like soupy. Not what I think of texture-wise when I think of patatas bravas.* Rice with bacon wrapped dates - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026You can pretty much never go wrong when bacon+dates go together. The rice was tasty but a little undercooked and hard.* CROQUETAS DE POLLO - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Chicken and ham puffs served with ali-oli sauce.)A little oily, and the outer breaded layer is a little thin - I like just a little more crunch. I found the filling to really not be much protein, even if it was fairly tasty.* CHAMPI\u00d1ONES A LA PLANCHA - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Grilled mushrooms with garlic and olive oil)A solid dish, but I'm just not too big of a fan of pure mushroom - the flavor is so strong that it really is better as a side/addition to something else.* GAMBAS AL AJILLO - 3.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine)Garlic-y! Tasty! Crunch! Fresh! P.S. Don't get this if you have any sort of adversity to garlic.* QUESO DE CABRA - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Baked goat cheese with fresh tomato basil sauce)So simple, yet I really liked this one. The bread was lightly toasted and had just a hint of a pesto/garlic spread. The warm tomato sauce and cheese tasted great when you added it on top.* VIEIRAS A LA PLANCHA - 3.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Grilled sea scallops with saffron sauce)One of the more unique dishes of the night! The scallops were seared lightly, though in my humble opinion could be a tiny bit more on the rare side. The rice was cooked thoroughly (in contrast to the bacon wrapped dates) and soggy, which I actually enjoyed in this saffron sauce!* PLATANO AL CARAMELO - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/caf\u00e9\u2026(Saut\u00e9ed banana with caramel sauce served with vanilla ice cream)Haha - you have to see the picture. Like I said.. bachelorette party. I thought it was hilarious that they would do this for us (or is it standard? I wasn't sure).

The d\u00e9cor encompassed two floors that started with the bar area, plenty of TVs, dim lighting, sectional dining areas, and dark wood and red bricks that overlapped our surroundings. We were seated at the bottom floor. The vibe was casual and the noise level was high. We started off with the Jamon Ibirico ($8.50) that came with four pieces of bread topped with minced tomato, manchego cheese, and thinly sliced cured ham. The bread they used was the same as those in the basket that was complimentary for every table. The cheese had good flavor, but it also dominated the cured ham that tasted lackluster. The dish was rather filling and not something I'd like to have again.Next, we had the Pulpo A LA Plancha ($8.75). It was presented with an assortment of seafood that included shrimp, squid, scallop, and white fish. The dish was covered in French fries that anchored this dish in a deep garlic flavor. There were some nice depths to the flavors, but the amount of French fries seemed to overwhelm the tiny pieces of seafood. I probably would have enjoyed this dish more had the potatoes was authentically fire roasted. It's not a dish that I would recommend either.Lastly, we shared the Seafood Paella ($12.95). It came with the same mix of seafood steeped in rice and a flavorful broth. The rice was a little soggier than expected, but the ensemble of flavors was passable, especially the seafood and peas. I find their prices to be affordable and the portions were satisfactory. Service was nonchalant and not particularly friendly. Our water was refilled several times and the server did come back to check on us regularly. However, I wished the dishes could be (re)introduced when they were delivered to the table. I also wished the server had taken the initiative to discuss the menu since this was our first visit. These were noticeable factors that influenced our experiences at this restaurant, as I saw other tables nearby received better service and treatment. 2.5 stars for the overall experience.

I have visited countless restaurants across the country, even made it through Poland and Prague without ingesting meat. When I previewed Iberico's menu, I did not foresee any vegetarian-lifestyle-killers. There were plenty of salads and seemingly vegetarian items. Until the following scene unfolded - Me to waitress: \"This white bean soup. What is in it?\"Waitress to me: \"Beans.\"Me to waitress: \"Okay, but what is its base? Does it have ham or cream or beef or anything like that?\"Waitress to me: \"No, it's beans.\"Me to waitress: \"Okay... beans?\"Waitress to me: \"Yes.\"Me to waitress: \"Okay, well then I will have the white bean soup.\"*Awkward conversation with dinner companion until plates arrive. Strangely the waitress brought both of my plates about 15 minutes before she brought the other person's. Finally all of our orders arrive.*I take spoonful of soup. I spit spoonful of soup into my napkin. I flag down waitress - Me to waitress: \"So, you're telling me this just has beans in it? No ham, nothing like that?\"Waitress to me: \"No, just beans. No ham. Beans... and it has sausage.\"Me to waitress: \"Okay... so you realize that I have not eaten meat for 15 years. Because you told me that the soup only contained beans, I just ate one of the most repugnant varieties of meat possible, right?\"Waitress to me: \"So you don't want the soup?\"At that point I imagine I turned a lovely shade of green, and shot the waitress a look that is usually reserved for cat-calls on the red line. I thought that things had hit as low as possible. Until my fellow diner (who will not again be dining with me) pulled out this gem - Fellow diner to me: \"You won't die. I promise.\"And he was right. I did, in fact, live through the night. I certainly hope both he and my lovely waitress enjoyed the rest of the evening. I spent the rest of it retching. Psychosomatic. I know. But this reveals something that could have been a lot more dramatic. If a diner allergic to nuts asked if a dish had peanuts in it, and the waitress said no, and the diner asked if it had cashews, and the waitress said no, and the diner ended up in anaphylactic shock because the dish, instead, contained walnuts, Iberico would have a far bigger problem on their hands than a disgruntled vegetarian.

Obviously we were grossed out and Andrea was done.Now, horrified as we were, \u00a0we're a sweet bunch (shucks we work at a non profit) and take things in stride. Yes this was unacceptable. (Really? Your line chefs chew gum while preparing food?). \u00a0But, mistakes happen.

Server asks if she would like a new entree and Andrea says no (no appetite for it now, and we have to get going), but whatever she could do to reduce the bill would be appreciated. A few minutes later the manager (?) comes to our table. \"Suprising!\" she says, when Andrea shows her the gum. Ummm, yeah.Then, as an afterthought, \"I'm so sorry. Can I get you a new one?\" No Andrea repeats, we have to go but whatever you can do to adjust the bill is appreciated. \"Would you like another entree?\" Nope, no time. \"Perhaps a chocolate tequila?\", the manager continues, obviously distressed.No, that's ok Andrea says.My other friend mentions to the manager that \u00a0she never got the Ensalada Mixta she ordered (40 minutes ago). \"Oh do you want it now\" she asks, apologetically, but with no indication that it would be brought either quickly or gratis. \u00a0Faced with the prospect of waiting for who knows how long, we said no thanks, just make sure it's not on the bill.So, we're anxiously waiting for the check, and a few minutes later we see our server....starting to pour us sangrias.

The chicken entree is taken off.Ok, fine. \u00a0We expected more (a few entrees comped?, something to take home?). The manager comes over and redundantly explains that the chicken entree was taken off. Then she sheepishly tells Andrea that if she *wants* she can take something else off the bill. Andrea doesn't really know what to say and \u00a0tells her to take off whatever she thinks is right.Manager disappears back up front, we're gathering our money (tip automatically added), and then as we're about to settle, the manager gives us a new bill. \"We took off the Jamon Iberico\" she exclaims..Grrrrrreat.We retract our 7 dollars or so, and hit the friggin' road!Now, I've been to Iberico many times before.

Then we got two desserts. It was me (fat kid) and two ladies (light eaters), so that was enough food.Everything was tasty, except the pincho de solomillo (not even served with horseradish - the horror), but the scallops and calamari were VERY good. I didn't like the sangria very much. For dessert we had the banana with caramel which was wicked awesome, despite the disturbingly phallic presentation. We also got flan, which was disappointing imo.

Just bring $20 and the check will pretty much wind up splitting equally; no matter how many people are there. \u00a0I don't know how this works, but somehow it always ends up true.Word of advice: it takes 30 minutes or so to make the paella, so it's a good idea to order this first and then drink sangria before ordering the rest if you want them to arrive at the same time. \u00a0The paella is $8.95 (for the vegetarian) to $10.95 but it is gigantic. \u00a0One thing that I think has improved at Cafe Iberico since I used to be a regular is the selection of vegetarian tapases.

For instance over last winter ('05-'06) I took a date there to drink bourbon and talk about whatever rolled off my riled mind. We sat down and took off our coats and were met with sub-arctic temperatures. I mean a polar bear would have had difficulty surviving in that joint. For some reason they were running the air conditioning on a Thursday night, in the dead of Chicago's winter. When our food arrived the dishes that were supposed to be piping hot were cold and the dishes that were supposed to be cold were sporting a fine layer of miniscule ice crystals (okay the ice crystals may be a bit eccentric). When I asked the wait staff and hostess to please turn down the AC, I was met with... \"I'll check with the manager.\" and a look like, \"Good luck chump.\"\rAnyway, the moral of the story is that this used to be a GREAT place to go and have amazing tapas... but no longer is it worthwhile... unless you go on Tuesday night toward the end of Spring.

You can get completely stuffed on Spanish tapas and soused on sangria for about $20.The good thing about tapas, and the reason for the cuisine's popularity, is the ability to try several different dishes. One of the original restaurants of this type, Cafe Iberico's been serving tapas since before tapas was cool. Their dishes range from the expected Marinated Spanish Olives (aceitunas alinadas) to the very-American-seeming Chicken and Ham Puffs. Yes, these are deep-fried rolls of chicken and ham served with a white cream sauce. Since I'm from Indiana I naturally love 'em.They also serve grilled octopus, which does not taste like chicken and is actually one of my favorites. I also love love love the Queso de Cabra (baked goat cheese in a tomato basil sauce), the grilled mushrooms, the smoked salmon, and the spicy potatoes. The grilled shrimp always sounds really good, but the couple of times I've had it it's been overcooked. There are so many items to choose from it doesn't really bother me, so instead I'll get the chicken brochette with carmelized onions and rice. There are standard menu items, but they also feature weekly specials to mix it up a bit.For those who don't like to share their food, Cafe Iberico has several salads and entrees to choose from, including Paella. Desserts feature flan, of course, and last time I went there with a birthday group they served the Platano Al Caramelo - sauteed banana with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. WOW!Cafe Iberico is not the place to go for a romantic date. For one reason, they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday at all, and the rest of the week only for parties of 6 or more. Another reason is it's a casual atmosphere and it can get pretty loud. That being said, it's a great restuarant for a get-together with friends over a pitcher of really good sangria.I think that's why I like the place so much. The surroundings are comfortable and amiable and I'm sharing good food and drinks with good friends.

\u00a0Maybe there's a different hairstyle, or they've been exercising and look really good, but aside from the minor differences, the two of them pick up like they talked yesterday. \u00a0Well Cafe Iberico is like that.The Sadie and I love Cafe Iberico. \u00a0We'd probably eat there more often if we lived in River North or somewhere along LaSalle, Dearborn, or Clark streets. \u00a0As it is we try to eat there every couple of months, just so we catch up with our infrequently seen tapas friend. \u00a0Neither The Sadie nor I are originally from Chicago. \u00a0And until I moved to Chicago, I'd never had tapas. \u00a0I'm an adventurous eater, but I'd never had the opportunity to try them. \u00a0So once The Sadie introduced me to them about 4 years ago, I've been smitten. \u00a0Typically our dinner will consist of the Sangria (buy a pitcher, it's more economical that way), and about 2-3 dishes. \u00a0We love the Jamon Iberico. \u00a0The Iberian ham is like pancetta or prosciutto and complements the tomato topped toast and Manchego cheese very well. \u00a0We also love the Raxo Adobodo (pork loin with fries) and the Pincho De Solomillo (skewed beef tenderloin). \u00a0The caramelized onions that come with the Pincho are dark and sweet and balance the beef exceptionally well. \u00a0We've tried the Patatas Ali-Oli and I found them too heavy with mayonnaise, and The Sadie was completely non-plussed, but I think it could be that the order came late in the meal. \u00a0Some of the other dishes I've tried and enjoyed are the Plato Combinado (Spanish coldcuts), the Salmon Ahumado (salmon w/ capers and a fresh dill cream. \u00a0Yummy!), Pincho de Pollo (skewered chicken w/ Spanish rice), Queso de Cabra (baked goat cheese), the Croquetas De Pollo (deep fried ham and chicken puffs), and Chorizo Y Morcilla (a combo platter of Spanish sausages. \u00a0One of my personal faves.)I love the flan at Cafe Ibrico and the Plantano al Caramelo (sauted banana w/ caramel sauce) is a favorite of The Sadie.Unfortunately there are a couple of drawbacks to dining at Cafe Iberico. \u00a0The first is planning when you go. \u00a0Early is always better. \u00a0After 5pm, the restaurant fills quickly with downtown workers (secretaries, office assistants, wage slaves, and cube dwellers). \u00a0Once this happens, the wait grows exponentially. \u00a0So if you go after 5pm, be aware of it. \u00a0Another drawback is the noise. \u00a0In most of the restaurant the ceiling is low and the walls are painted brick meaning that when the restaurant is full an average conversation has to be conducted at a near shout. \u00a0The large dining room on the north side of the restaurant really needs to cover the walls in some sort of heavy drapery to cut the noise to a manageable level. \u00a0The Sadie and I dined there early one Saturday (about 2:30 pm) and with only about 7 other tables occupied the volume was edging toward being too loud.The final drawback is the paucity of available restrooms. \u00a0Unfortunately, there's not a lot that can be done about that.The drawbacks aren't enough though to drastically impact my review. \u00a0They're really more of a collection of nuisances that if expected and planned for, don't affect your experience significantly.All-in-all, Cafe Iberico is an enjoyable, inexpensive place to dine, and a great place to take your out of town guests if you want to have some fun, some great food, and a memorable experience.", "Date": "2008-01-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Dominic R.", "ReviewID": "I5DVWXfDuksWTeNgLM7HYg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Came here last night since my date suggested I try it. \u00a0Last weekend we went to Cafe Babareeba, so this time I figured we'd try this place out. \u00a0She said they had great Sangria and good food. \u00a0Well let me say, the Sangria was pretty good....strong! \u00a0The food was spicey, and it was ok. \u00a0For some reason we were seated in the \"dungeon\" on a Friday night......had bad service and it was just too loud in the basement!Overall, it was ok. \u00a0I like Cafe Babareeba better......better food portions and selections and just a better time. \u00a0They do not take reservations which is stupid, so be prepared on a weekend to wait........", "Date": "2009-10-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mario V.", "ReviewID": "6UoGfWcu0VUuHW5PzATF0w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had my birthday dinner here last night.

This is probably because all the recommendations are coming from those eat hereThe interior is a small bar and 2 large dining rooms, one upstairs, and one belowstairs. The upstairs one is nicely decorated enough that you could eat here for a night out on the town, but if you only wore blue jeans and a t-shirt, you would fit in perfectly as well.While the decorations may come off a little on the tacky side, Iberico more than makes up for it with everything else...They have the cheapest sangria in the city...at $13 bucks a pitcher, It would be a crime to not try the sangria roja, which is fruity enough that non-wine drinkers can still enjoy it, but strong enough that a couple pitchers may still have you and your friends dancing on the tables singing \"La Bamba\"Iberico has probably the best variety of hot and cold tapas in the city, although Ba ba reeba, Sangria, and others may occasionally beat them in price.

The eggplant was soft and cooked to perfection, the goat cheese inside warm and just beginning to melt. The croquettes were crispy and contrasted nicely with the tang and coolness of the mayonaisse, and the garlic shrimp had a flavor that belied their size.The wait staff was helpful and friendly, and brought our late guests full glasses of sangria at no charge, even though the pitcher was empty when they arrived.

Same food and instead of having people carrying food over our heads and smushed next to our table, we actually had some room to ourselves.Ordered the mushrooms, and two specials, one with scallops and leeks, and the other with pork and mushrooms on toast. After the first bite, I knew why people were willing to wait 2 hours to eat. Totally worth it!

Before we even got the drink they came over and asked us if we would mind switching one table over. Of course we didn't mind, but I am still unsure why we needed to. They switched us between a 2 person table and a 2 person table, so that couldn't be why. About 3 minutes later another 2 person group was sat down, which seemed very odd.The waiter was extremely nice, and ever gave us a Spanish lesson after we mispronounced our order. The sangria we ordered was delicious, and break we had was delicious as well.As our main dish me and the girlfriend split three things, we got a bread dish that came with a pesto type sauce, cheese and some red sauce. Additionally we split 2 different fish dishes. All of the food was very delicious; however I thought the portions were a bit small. The mashed potatoes also came with some greens in it that wasn't listed in the menu, which was a bit disappointing. We both definitely enjoyed ourselves and the prices were very reasonable as well.My only major complaint about the place was the noise level.

The atmosphere consisted of a packed, energetic crowd with almost everyone engaged in very loud conversations. So my group definitely had to speak louder than usual to hear each other. This was the main reason why I decided to give this place 4 stars instead of 5.The service was excellent as our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and efficient in bringing our dishes and drinks. Great smile with an excellent attitude.As we waited for our food, I ordered the Sangria which I heard many friends rave about. I was impressed with it as it had a great balance of fruity flavors and aromas that matched well the red wine in the Sangria. Very tasty and delicious. Not the best Sangria I ever ordered, but definitely in my top 5.For dinner, we ordered the TOSTADAS DE PISTO tapas and the QUESO DE CABRA tapas. The Tostadas De Pisto was toasted bread topped with stewed eggplant, peppers, onion, Zucchini tomato and olive oil. The eggplant had amazing texture and was cooked to perfection, and the peppers and onions added a great kick to the dish. The Zucchini tomato (I never knew there was a Zucchini tomato!) was delicious, and the olive oil which was drizzled on top added a light, fruity flavor to the dish. Overall, I was very satisfied with these tapas.The other tapas we ordered was the Queso De Cabra which is simply baked goat cheese with fresh tomato basil sauce. The goat cheese was a little undercooked for my preference, but the taste was fantastic... very rich and creamy without being too salty. The sauce was so fresh and good. You could tell the sauce was homemade. The combination of the sauce with the cheese was a winner. Definitely a delicious but light tapas meal.Overall, my experience here was great. The entire order cost us less than $30 so very reasonable for the quality of the food and Sangria. My only disappointment was that we weren't hungry enough to order a couple more tapas dishes.

I wanted to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in a long time but since he had been living in Chicago a bit, I told him he had to make the pick. We ended up coming here which was an excellent choice. Forgive the picture quality however; the lighting was dim.We started off with the patatas bravas which were potatoes covered in a spicy tomato sauce. There was something just oh-so-smooth but firm about the texture that made the potatoes work. The sauce had a great spicy kick to it that intensified by the folds as you ate more; one minute you're having a good time and the next, you've hit it up a notch with the heat. They were excellent.Next tapas that came out was the queso de cabra which was baked goat cheese with a tomato basil sauce to top on some bread. That goat cheese was amazingly creamy and smooth. I don't know what magic wonders they worked on that cheese but it was so silky in my mouth, I wanted to just eat the whole thing. Altogether, the plate reminded us of a spin on bruschetta. Classic.The best tapas of the night was the pulpo a la plancha. We have to thank Yelp for that heads-up. It was grilled octopus with potatoes and olive oil. Amazing. The grilled octopus had a fantastic texture, and the charred part spoke volumes about the quality of the grill and technique. So much flavor packed into the seafood parts and the potatoes were a nice pair. Everything was garlicky in that I-need-more kind of way. Everyone loved this dish.Out next came the paella iberica which the waiter kindly told us to order ahead of time so we could get it on time; it was its own medley of seafood (mussels and clams), pork, chicken, peas, carrots, and rice in saffron sauce. I've got to say that it wasn't all too fantastic in my book and fairly basic. However, it wasn't bad; the rice was a good texture and consistency instead of mushy and the meats were plentiful. Perhaps I'm not a paella person?The last dish was their braised beef short ribs in mashed potatoes (it was a weekly special so I don't remember the official name). The beef peeled away from the bone beautifully and nearly melted in my mouth. So rich and creamy, the short ribs were fantastic. They were also bedded on some of the creamiest and heaviest mashed potatoes I've ever had. We definitely would've had more of it if we had the stomach real estate!Our drinks of choice were glasses of sangria from a shared pitcher. Quite delicious indeed!

I like red better than white because red tastes more like wine. The white is good for anyone who likes really sweet sangria. A pitcher is really cheap (about $12 or so and is enough for 2 or 3 people). If you're getting just one glass, I recommend getting the half pitcher. This will get you a lot more for a buck extra.The beer - I like beer, like most other people. They have the basics with some added labels. I really like Estrella. It's a Spanish beer that has a sort of spiced taste. It is similar to Quilmes from Argentina if you've ever had it. Other beer I've tried there: DAMN BARCELONA. The best part of this beer is the name. I didn't like it all that much...The food - is wickedly amazingly good. Tapas is basically small plates of food you can share. At Cafe Iberico (or CI as my friends and I call it) they are more like entrees. I always get the Salmon a la Pimienta. It's always so good and filling. I like it better than the other salmon dish... which I forget the name. The garlic potato salad is good, but pretty garlicky, so I'd get a mint if I were you. The chicken skewers with caramelized onions are yummy. The shrimp dishes are very tasty but not as filling. I haven't really had anything I didn't like there.

The way I remember Cafe Iberico, I'm hunched in the middle of mi amigos with tapas up and down the table in both directions. Some plates were in danger of falling off, but the pitchers of sangria were safe and secure and within reach, so no one was too worried. The lights were down low, the music was pumping high to an Andalusian pitch, you had to scream to be heard, and it's hard to tell what was loudest -- the soundtrack, your vocals, your stomach growling, or your gut digesting. In fact, when I went to Spain for the very first time last fall and found myself elbow to elbow with locals on many a stop on plenty of tapas tours, I thought to myself -- Cafe Iberico got it right.Last night when we went, I had to wonder if we were at the same place (a couple of circles around the block in a plaintive attempt to find street parking that ultimately ended up in the hands of the valet was our first clue that we didn't, indeed, pull up to a wrong spot). I almost had to wear my sunglasses when we stepped in -- bright! Open! Airy! Muted music! Plenty of room to maneuvre! Are we not in Spain anymore?!Idealistically speaking, the remodelling was a good thing. Room to move and toast and order more tapas, no need to see the shrink for claustrophobia next week.

Sangria - Definitely red, and keep it coming. \u00a0First, the point of sangria is not to get you drunk, but to allow you to keep drinking all night. \u00a0Enough alcohol to make you feel good, but not to get you out of control. \u00a0With the food, this is exactly where you want be with friends.Food - Superbly excellent. \u00a0 From the very Spanish standards of Queso de Cabra (goat cheese baked in a tray of tomato sauce, served with garlic bread), Champinones a la Plancha (mushrooms roasted in a garlic butter or shallot butter), \u00a0Gambas a la Plancha (shrimps roasted in an olive oil garlic) are delicious and savory, having all the sauces quickly sopped up by bread. \u00a0 The Pulpo a la Plancha (grilled octopus lightly seasoned, served mixed with fried potatoes) is a real sign they know what they are doing. \u00a0Octopus is notoriously hard to cook, and theirs is tender, flavorful, and never chewy. \u00a0Order the Paella Iberica (a rice saffron stew with a mix of seafood, chicken and pork) ahead while to order the rest. \u00a0 Definitely try the specials, but ask and try it. \u00a0Desserts are also fantastic, but be sure to try the white chocolate flan when you see it - the subtleness of the white chocolate with the creamy vanilla of the custard is just a dance of flavors on your tongue, the strawberry or raspberry puree adds a nice contrast.Atmosphere - walk in any night of the week, except Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and this place is full. \u00a0When you come on the weekend days, it is packed with the fashionable, the European, and gregarious. \u00a0The music is a catchy mix of euro disco, Spanish flameco, and other fun pop artists. \u00a0Be yourself, enjoy yourself, but bring yourself and participate!Price - In a group of 4 or more, I can almost guarantee that you will get out of there, sangria + food + dessert + tip + full & happy face, for $25/head Caveats - Vegetarians, vegans, etc - well, Spain is a meat eating country and they eat all kinds. \u00a0Remember, older countries use everything for food and the recipes are based on hundreds of years of people working and living off the land and sea. \u00a0A meal of just potatoes and onions was not enough to sustain a person working the fields or the sea. \u00a0Do we know of an exclusively vegetarian simian society that is still in existence today?

I figured some people may not like Iberico because their tapas are not \"fancy\" and loaded with unnecessary ingredients. But that's the beauty of it all. You get to enjoy the true taste of the dish. Definitely worth trying would be Calamares a la Plancha (grilled squid), Gambas al a jillo (grilled shrimp), Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes, better than Cafe Babareeba's!), Paella Iberica, Mejillones a la Marinara (steamed mussles), Champinones a la Plancha (grilled mushrooms), White Sangria, etc.Everything is reasonably priced and the portions are just right.The only thing that bothers me about this place is that it can get really loud.

Plus they will not seat you until your entire party is present.Now that we got that out of the way...lets continue.Once you managed to get a table immediately order a pitcher or two of their famous sangria for the table. Keep in mind this is a tapas bar so sharing is caring and no one is getting their own entree.Start off by ordering the patatas bravas (spicy potatoes), Queso de Cabra (baked goat cheese), Pincho de Solomillo (beef tenderloin skewer & caramelized onions), Champinoes a la plancha (grilled mushrooms). Those are my top must before eveing making a dent in my appetite. You can never go wrong with their grilled octopus, squid or shrimp, this seems to always make its way to the table.The servers move quick and the order is up just as fast. So be ready!The pricing is reasonable and attractive enough for couples to dine in on a date and the atmosphere is just as rewarding. Larger groups will definitely get the bigger bill however when divided collectively its not so bad.

Right off the bat it wasn't what I was expecting, which was an intimate, dimly lit tapas bar with few a tables and maybe some Spanish guitar to set the mood. It's sort of the Applebees of tapas places, but not in an entirely bad way. More like in a I could see this place being in any smaller Midwestern town and being very attractive to non-adventurous eaters kind of way. It's big, loud, fast and only vaguely Spanish. But the food was good. Didn't knock my socks off, but I had fun and left full.Here's the rundown:Patatas Bravas - Cubed potatoes in a smokey, spicy tomato sauce. The highlight of the meal for me. Portion was big enough so that the three of us got about two big spoonfuls each. I could have polished off the whole thing myself.Queso de Cabra - Toasted french bread with a tomato and mozzarella dipping sauce. Tangy and good, but not a standout. It takes a lot to mess up cheesy tomato bread. Five pieces so not an easy split.Camerones Gambia - Grilled shrimp in butter sauce. Nine to ten shrimp in an order. They are not huge but are tasty. Like the queso, it's a solid dish but a bit forgettable.Salmon and Scallops (forgot the Spanish name) - Three chunks of salmon and three small scallops in a green garlic sauce. I expected the sauce to be spicier but it was more sweet. Not a ton of flavor on the seafood and the salmon was dry. Probably the low note for me. Vegetable Paella - Large pan of rice with peppers, onions, zucchini, carrots and squash. The sauce was really flavorful, almost like soy sauce. Big enough to be a meal for one person. Tiramisu - Basic preparation (lady fingers in Baileys plus cocoa powder) but with drizzled with STRAWBERRY sauce and chunks. Uh, what?! It's tiramisu, people. Chocolate sauce that shit up. And maybe add some vanilla ice cream. Just sayin'. This one confused me and I wasn't feeling it. Wish I'd gotten the crepes.Fried Banana - The most phallic dessert imaginable. But so good. Seved with cinnamon and vanilla ice cream. Putting aside the whole fruit as dessert issue, I really liked this and would get again.Red Sangria - Fruity and delicious but, in the grand tradition of sangria, not strong at all. Caipirinha - So good. A great summer drink, but delicious all year round. Light, refreshing and just sugary enough. HIghly recommend this one.This place is better suited to big groups, where you're not as interested in the ambiance and more about being able to cram a bunch of people around a table and chat and share some OK food.

The last meal I had was half a bowl of oatmeal at 6 AM. I was famished. No, rather, I thought my stomach was eating itself and my blood glucose level was so low my friends had to practically carry me to the restaurant.I was a sad sight.I was led to a table, sat down. Opened the menu, and as I tried to read, the room spun around. I think I mumbled something to the tune of \"just order for me\" and closed the menu. A few moments later, the bread basket arrived. I scarfed down a few pieces, dipped in olive oil with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Finally, the room stopped spinning. I looked around.The space is actually quite large! And beautiful tile everywhere. My favorite dish was definitely the scallops. That and the seafood paella. I'm coming back for those. We also enjoyed the chorizo dish and the grilled octopus - not rubbery or chewy but really awesome with the fried potatoes! I also really loved the potato salad which was a surprise because I usually hate anything that is suggestive of mayonnaise. Delightfully light!The desserts were so scrumptious and not to be missed. They were decadent and sweet without being too sweet or overly rich. Just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and make you say \"mmmm\". Service was decent, but nothing spectacular.

It's a perfect place for bringing a crowd of friends, co-workers for happy hour, date for an ice-breaker or family for fun evening. Food & Drinks - I have come across many tapas bars that are an epic failure when comes to sangria. I consider it an important part of a tapas meal. No good sangria, no returning customer! Cafe Iberico does a better job but just above average at the best. I, personally, enjoy consuming superfluous amounts of sangria per Cafe Iberico visit. It goes well with their atmosphere and sometimes, present company. \u00a0If that's not your thing, feel free to order a bottle of wine. Food is good and meets expectations well (don't set expectation to what you may have eaten in Madrid) . Their tapas menu is fairly wide with a well-balanced selections between seafood, beef and chicken. They have a lot of the traditionally popular tapas recipes on the menu and then some of their own which fare well. Portions are generous for tapas size but you'll probably order a few rounds. If you are longing for something off-the-menu, ask their friendly serve staff. I have never been disappointed by their suggestions. If you are dessert person, skip the flan and ice-cream.Tip to first timers - order few tapas at a time. Keep the menu handy and order several rounds, if required. Their turnaround time is fast and keeps things fresh at the table. Parking - its downtown. You may get lucky with metered parking otherwise they have reasonably priced valet service. 10-min walk from Chicago redline station. Word of advice... be ready to wait on Fri-Sat evenings.

They have a huge menu and you can find something for everyone whether they are vegetarian, meat eater, seafood lover, or all of the above. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was not packed at all! It was a nice surprised and you can actually have a conversation with your meal mates. Otherwise, during their peak hours, the restaurant gets really LOUD and you can barely hear the person you're enjoying your meal with. I've never gotten anything that's bad there - maybe something I wouldn't order again as it's just not my favorite flavor profile.

Once I realized that we were close to Cafe Iberico, we made the decision to go there, because everyone I know loves it.I was pretty impressed. They've got the classic tapas dishes you find at all tapas places, but they're very well done. The Patatas Bravas were ACTUALLY spicy here, not just mildly spiced like at most places. We also tried the Chorizo y Morcilla (sausage sampler plate) and it was pretty awesome - chorizo and a ham-like sausage, but also a black sausage that usually I would never eat (blood is weird) but that I tried and actually ate an entire slice myself.We also got a few of their weekly specials. (These aren't listed on their webpage so I can't tell you the Spanish names, unfortunately.) We had a grilled beef dish with potatoes and peppers that was pretty tasty. The potato and goat cheese croquettes with a roasted pepper sauce were really really good, bonus points for having bread at the table to sop up extra sauce. But what was really good (and which a lot of people probably wouldn't think to order) was the grilled cuttlefish with squid ink and pasta. I know, squid ink is kinda gross. I even usually don't eat things with tentacles. But this stuff was GOOD. Tender cuttlefish, more like the texture of a scallop, and the squid ink sauce was almost sweet tasting. By far the best dish we ordered.The pitcher of sangria was also tasty, and huge for only $15. We shared it between 4 people, and everyone got at least 2 glasses.My only complaint - it's really noisy in there. I don't know if it was because we were sandwiched in between 2 parties of very excited 20-year-old girls, or if it was the bus boy who kept dropping things, but the noise level seemed high for a Thursday night.

The location is great, the ambiance is true in it's authenticity, and the food is delicious. You should be prepared to wait it out if you're going on the weekend, and calling ahead will not help as they do not accept reservations. They have implemented a TV that displays your name when it is your turn to feast. I have favorite items that I always get, and on my last visit me and my girlfriend decided to try something new. So I wanted to order the RAXO ADOBADO (hot pork dish with home fries), and the waiter suggested the \"special\" version on the weekly specials list. I HATE myself for not noting the exact name, but If you are in there just look for it on the specials page (hopefully it is still there). This pork must have been cooked for hours it was so tender. If you're going on a date, and he or she maybe lost some teeth, or perhaps has been advised to drink ensure instead of solids by their doctor, FEED THEM THIS! It was deliciously moist and soft, and the mashed potatoes and peppers. It were awesome!My regular orders are the Croquetas, smoked salmon, clams, baked goat cheese, and the gambas. Salmon is always good, but they never give me enough bread! I love the clams the most, sometimes there are more shells than clams, and the shallot garlic sauce is bomb.

I was going to go to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I had a few friends say oohhhh noooooo and one suggested Iberico. It had a pretty solid rating on yelp, wasn't a pain in the ass to get to (I'm in Logan Square), and as a bonus was open late. My boyfriend and I oohed and ahhed at the menu and got excited. Neither of us had eaten tapas before.We get there around 11p on a Saturday night. i had a backup in case this place was open til 1:30 but the kitchen closed early but that was definitely not the case. We were seated immediately but there were still plenty of people there- perfect! It was a bit hard to hear in there at first, but as we ate (we stayed until 12:30) it emptied a bit more and it was easier. There were also a bunch of 90s music videos playing, which was kind of weird, but entertaining.We started off with a half pitcher of sangria (red). It was only $10 and we each got about 2-3 glasses out of it so it was a great deal. We split an order of Queso de Cabra, goat cheese in a tomato basil sauce. I've never had anything with goat cheese I didn't like so it was divine. As for our plates, I got Salmon Ahumado (sliced salmon, dill sauce, capers, toast) and this Spanish potato salad with tuna, peas, carrots (can't find the name as it's not online even though it wasn't a special). Both dishes were cold and very delicious. The potato salad was a huge portion so I took half home and it made for a good snack. He got Patatas Ali-Oli, Red potatoes with garlic mayonnaise sauce. He loves garlic and there were cloves of it, and I will probably be eating his leftovers from that (again, huge portions), and Gambas Al Ajillo, grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine. We didn't have room for desert, as we were so stuffed, but we had a wonderful time! Bill for 5 plates and the 1/2 pitcher of sangria was about $51, so definitely not bad at all, also considering we have 2 portions of leftovers.

The 4 of us were finally seated at 9:55 at a table for 2 and real hungry. There was a table for 4 people that was open right next to us but they sat us down at the table for 2, needless to say for a tapas restaurant sitting four at a 2 had me pissed off. Anyhow the waiter came, basically was pretty inattentive, never told us about the specials, and ultimately was way too quick with our dishes, at one point i had to tell him slow it down cause clearly we had no room left on the table, but did they? No, matter of fact they sped it up, as if they wanted us outta there as quick as possible. We spent more time picking up and rearranging dishes then we did eating.Everything we ordered was good, the goat cheese was excellent, patatas fritas was very good, the PINCHO DE SOLOMILLO, was the highlight such tender meat, pollo a la brasas also very good, the salmon tasty and great sauces all around, the food and the price got this place UP to a 3 star rating. But at the end of the day its what can you do without more, good food or horrible service, and for me its horrible service, i might return during the week when it isnt so busy.

I try not to go too often for the sheer fact that I want to keep my visits special, but I still make a trip every couple of months or so... It's all in the presentation.... \u00a0The atmosphere is very simple and you will feel like you're sitting in a Spanish cafe drinking sangria amongst your closet friends. \u00a0The tile on the floor (and some tables) looks as if it were old Spanish tile with bright eccentric colors that will make your eyes wander through the designs. \u00a0The wooden ceiling in the north dining room drips with Spanish charm, while the old fashioned deli just up a few steps makes your nose become excited with the aroma of various meats and cheeses. \u00a0The staff is very attentive and you will rarely, if ever have to ask for your water to be refilled and table to be cleared for the new appetizer-style plates to arrive. \u00a0For the main event... The restaurant offers a great variety of Tapas food that couldn't express the Spanish-food-culture more. \u00a0The small plates are great to pass around and make it very convenient for everyone to sample. \u00a0Although I've tried almost everything the menu has to offer I do have a few favorites that I will order every time I step foot in the establishment (they are listed below).* Tortilla Espanola - Vegetarian Spanish omelet* Jamon Iberico - Spanish style cured ham with manchego cheese and tomato bread*Patatas Bravas - Spicy potatoes with special tomato sauce.*Pincho De Pollo - Chicken brochette with caramelized onions and rice.*Gambas Al Ajillo - Grilled shrimp with olive oil, garlic and wine.*Mejillones A La Marinera - Steamed mussels with marinara sauce.*Filloa De Helado Y Crema \u00a0- Stuffed crepe with ice cream topped with whipped cream and strawberry sauce.With all of the positivity being sung, I only have one itty bitty complaint- and that is the size of the tables. \u00a0The tables are pretty small if it's a table of 2-4; and with all of the delicious food that is ordered it's sometimes hard to find room for it all. \u00a0I understand that they are trying to save space and have room for smaller parties of people (2-3), but they need to big a smidge larger to fit everything comfortably (without glasses clinking and plates overlapping one another).If you are looking for a great first date place, friend/family/group dinner, casual night out with the girls (or guys) or even a place to take clients, Cafe Iberico is the perfect place for all of the above. \u00a0Salud!", "Date": "2010-06-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jackie C.", "ReviewID": "BoRlKKwV8z_ddU4kMjbpXw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Cafe Iberico makes outstanding tapas.

Also we have a group tradition of having Sweet Mandy B's cupcakes for birthdays, and they let us bring them into the restaurant. They even took them from me at the beginning and served them to us on a plate with lit candles when it was time for dessert. They told me they typically charge $1/person cut fee - but it didn't show up on the bill, and the waiter told me not to worry about it. \u00a0Love that. All in all we had a great night here. The staff was friendly and accomodating and the food was delicious.

The patatas bravas were roughly the size of a small mountain. They were seasoned well, but a little overfried. The croquettes were good, but nothing remarkable; the croquettes at Porto's in LA are still the best I've ever had. The octopus was fantastic -- perfectly charred and seasoned, and atop a bed of deliciously soggy fries, I could've eaten three orders of those.

Iberico makes it so every piece of this dish is edible. -Last but certainly not least, the sangria (red!) is sweet, seductive and sneaks up on you like *that*. The only potential pitfall - this place's bathrooms tend to look like those at a frat party as the night gets busier and the crowd grows denser. So drink that sangria cautiously, friends.One of the most important things to note: Iberico doesn't take reservations. Know that you may wait for an hour - or 5 minutes. If you're looking for a date place with set times, go to Cafe Ba-ba-reeba or Emilio's instead.

Unless you would enjoy eating at a dance club environment with pretty horrible music, you will not enjoy eating here. The restaurant is dingy, has a weird smell to it, and is really loud and noisy. There are 3 \"levels to the restaurant: the floor level is probably the nicest because it is the closest to looking like a restaurant, the upper level is kind of like a cafe with a dessert display and kitchen window, and the bottom level feels like you are in the basement because it is stuffy and smelly. We ordered four dishes to share: scallops, beef tenderloin with fries, small clams, and spicy potatoes and I liked them in the order listed. All of the dishes are decent portions and range from $6.50 - $9. Service is pretty bad. Our server was Denell and we should have taken her bitchy attitude from the beginning as a warning sign to eat somewhere else. She was flabbergasted when a pregnant woman did not want to order a sangria with her meal. After we finished eating, we told her we did not want any coffee or dessert. As she was getting our check, I asked if the restaurant did anything for birthdays. She said \"of course.\" She then brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a candle in it. She later brought the bill and charged me $5.50 for the birthday dessert. I could not believe it. She should have told me that there was a charge for a birthday celebration or at least asked what the guest of honor would like if we were going to have to pay for it. She also obviously knew that we had not been to the restaurant before because we had asked her about the number of dishes to order, etc. when we arrived at the restaurant. I talked to the manager about this on the way out and he tried to explain that the restaurant only offers a candle for birthdays. I told him that the server should have told me that was the case rather than selecting a dessert herself and padding the check. He said that he would talk to her about it which I knew was BS because he didn't even bother to ask WHO our server was.Overall, this has got to be one of the worst dining experiences that we had in Chicago and I am so bummed that it happened on a birthday.

This was the first time I've ever tried tapas but knew exactly what they were before i went there. A group of us went there recently for dinner on a Friday night. One thing i didn't realize about the place was that there was two levels to the restaurant and the top level had a different menu than the bottom level. We didn't really know the difference so we just stayed on the bottom floor. We were all guessing though that the top level had pricier selections. It looked pretty busy there but we were sat right away, but it was really loud so it was kind of difficult hearing each other talk at the table. They had a variety of different drinks to choose from, but my boyfriend and I opted to order a pitcher of the red sangria to drink through out dinner and we had no problem finishing that baby off lol it was really good. Their menu is divided up into cold tapas, hot tapas, entrees, and deserts. Since tapas are smaller servings served family style you normally order a couple to share, that way you get to try an assortment of different dishes. We agreed to order 2 tapas; 1 cold and 1 hot. i picked the cold one which was a plate of spanish style cured ham with manchego cheese and tomato bread (which was kind of like a crostini that was topped with seasoned tomatoes). He chose the hot one. I can't remember the name of it but it was kind of a disappointment. the menu description said potatoes in a paprika wine sauce with sausage only for us to find out that \"with sausage\" basically means they only add a couple of chucks for flavor. The food came out a lot faster than i though it would and was not bad, but nothing spectacular. Some other things ordered at our table were grilled squid, beef tenderloin, and pork with chimichuri all of which were pretty good too. We tried some different desserts on the menu too and my favorite was the chocolate flan with strawberry sauce. it was realllyy good. Like i said the service was fast and the staff seemed nice. When we weren't particularly thrilled with the potato tapa we asked our server, curiously, if that was how it was supposed to be made and brought out. She explained that she would get her manager even though it wasn't that big of a deal. the manager explained that that's just how it was prepared and asked us if we would like another order of it. we declined but said that you. Turns out that she had another one sent out on the house which was very nice. There is a lot to be said for a restaurant who takes care of their customers. I would probably want to try another tapas place before i came back there again, but would be willing to give it another shot in the future and will def try out some of the seafood or paella.", "Date": "2010-06-07", "Author_Location": "DeKalb, IL"}, {"Author": "Bridgette K.", "ReviewID": "RNhk-UxuDUe6h4VPa3fV3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Spain food and this is by far the best Tapas Bar I have ever gone too.

(major pet peeve.) both our waitress and what seemed to be 50 bus boys were constantly assaulting our table, taking things away without asking if we were done first. they were like snipers, removing an object & vanishing before you could utter a sound.after what appeared to be a \"floor manager\" saw my face when my glass of sangria with a few sips left in it was taken from me, he went & got me a brand new glass & explained to me that he trains his staff to remove things quickly in order to keep the tables clean - by nature, tapas creates a lot cluttter with all of the small plates & dishes. i get it - but could ya ask first? all of the activity at the table put us on edge - by the end, we were practically clutching onto our bread basket & the remainder of the goat cheese to forbid anyone from taking it. and that is NOT my idea of a relaxing date night. thanks for the glass of sangria though.so, iberico is tasty & cheap - but you might have to eat like you're in prison to finish any of what you order.", "Date": "2011-03-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Laura K.", "ReviewID": "jut_UOEeMh4Ccsz68LTWPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like everywhere in Chicago this place has HUGE portions.

It was good, although once again nothing special.The presentation could definetly go for some improvement. I would come back and give the other tapas a try. Every place deserves a second chance...ps.

First, this place is quite affordable for tapas, that should speak for itself and the expectations you want to set. For 5 of us, dinner food + tax + tip came to around $15 each and then some of us got sangria. Don't come to an affordable place with hundreds of seats and then expect that the waiters are going to catch every fork you drop. That being said, the low level of service here is entertaining. We sat right by a dish station so we heard lots of clattering. Our waiter nearly spilled sangria on us as he poured, gave us 4 plates instead of 5, and one of them was dirty. However, look at the big picture. The restaurant is packed. There's usually a bit of a wait for tables. The upfront bar is narrowly designed WITH seating so you create a traffic flow problem. The seats on the main floor are cramped and the conversation is so loud I can barely hear myself talk. Do you expect waiters to walk with grace or be able to notice every person's needs? Probably not. Even so, for the prices I was paying, the service is still subpar, which is dragging this review down to a 2.Quality of food: Don't expect it to be 5-star, however, I'd give the food 3 stars, and that is why I'm so perplexed why this place gets so packed. Then, perhaps many of you do not know what real amazing paella should taste like, and having visited Barcelona, I guess my taste buds were spoiled. Again, for a conveniently located restaurant, with affordable prices, high turnover, huge number of dining guests, expect mediocre food. My friend recommended the PULPO A LA PLANCHA (grilled octopus) and I squirmed eating it. I'm always a little hesitant to eat seafood from a casual restaurant in the midwest, and this one the texture was not crispy all the way through - in fact, some pieces of octopus were downright mushy. However, I did like the potatoes. We also ordered PINCHO DE SOLOMILLO (beef tenderloin skewer). The beef was decent, but I think the winner here were the caramelized onions. For entrees we tried the Paella Iberica (allow for time). As far as paellas go, this is low-quality to mediocre. The rice is bland, bits of protein are scarce, and I was hoping for more saffron to come through but I guess they were being stingy. My favorite dish of the whole night was actually the POLLO A LA ANDALUZA (sauteed chicken breast with green and black olives). The chicken was tender and cooked all the way through (thank goodness), and I was impressed withe complexity of the sauce. On the whole this was the one dish which I felt was worth having again.The ambiance about this place is a whole other level of crazy. I sat facing the large TV monitor that played cheesy low-budget high-makeout music videos all night long - kid friendly? natch. Even one of the waiters noticed us making fun of the videos and said, \"we have a lot of bad videos for you to watch!\" I thought he was pretty funny. However, I did not like the ambiance either. Compared to most other tapas places I go to on the east coast (there you go - I'm pretentious), this place was too loud, too big, too hurtful on the eyes. I'm just not sure if the ambiance was ever intentional or someone dreamed it up as a joke one day, and if so, well, I was definitely entertained.", "Date": "2012-04-01", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Michael B.", "ReviewID": "YppxfAxwEDq9Ps7CJJdEvw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Best deal for sangria I've found. \u00a0Large pitcher (not filled with ice) for only $13. \u00a0Fills six glasses. \u00a0Tapas are also good, and they have weekly specials so you can always try new ones each time you go. \u00a0Definitely get the \"platano al caremelo\" for dessert. \u00a0If you like bananas. \u00a0And caramel. \u00a0And ice cream.", "Date": "2007-07-31", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "akzidenz g.", "ReviewID": "SgwigUc2whojHfpI7E3_rw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i love this place, mainly for the white and red wine sangria! this place is affordable and is great to go to with large groups. the tapas arent the best ive had...they are good, but not fantasticly tasty. but hey, youre in chicago. whatever.", "Date": "2007-09-13", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Sam S.", "ReviewID": "T1PNLi6YxiB3zCD3twGfbQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best Spanish food I've ever had! \u00a0I love the 'croquetas de pollo' (creamy ham puffs--trust me, try it) and the garlic potato salad. \u00a0The olives are to die for and I am always pleased with the service. \u00a0The red sangria seems like the obvious choice to drink, but make sure and try the white sangria as well--it's fantastic! \u00a0The prices are good, the atmosphere (now smoke free!) is a bit loud, but with a European flair. \u00a0Great for large groups as you share food.", "Date": "2008-01-06", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Carl G.", "ReviewID": "tI3q6hUuVTv2g3vuO3Uhmg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Went to Caf\u00e9 Iberico last night with a group of friends.

Perhaps this is a sound policy of theirs for busy times, but when the restaurant is not busy, it's rude and off-putting. Indeed, the service was slightly substandard. Although the waitstaff was helpful and offered some good tapas suggestions, little things were amiss such as a shortage of serviettes (cheap paper ones at that), the prompt refilling of water and the periodically late arrival of individual dishes (eg we ordered Gazpacho soup, beef skewers, clams, mussels and lamb in a third round of tapas, but the soup arrived inexplicably late, only slightly before we were ordering desert). All in all the tapas was average: goat cheese and a heavy-handed tomato sauce, mussels, clams (both fine), shrimps (fine but the dish was removed too quickly), lamb chops (excellent and perfectly cooked), beef skewers (over-cooked but with excellent caramelized onions), grilled octopus with fries (octopus in tiny over-cooked chunks), and empanadas (excellent). \u00a0On the whole, I'd probably suggest just giving it a miss.

Be careful though, because it will definitely sneak up on you and you'll feel it when you get up to leave. I go there at least 5-6 times a year and I've tried various things on the menu- I've never been disappointed. Some of my favorites are:patatas ali-oli (potato salad with garlicky mayo sauce)jamon iberico (Spanish ham with manchego cheese and tomato toasts)queso de cabra (baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and pesto toasts)pulpo a la plancha (grilled octopus with potatoes)and raxo adobado (pork loin with thin french fries)If it's your birthday, don't tell them unless you're jonesing for a phallic- but delicious- dessert.

There are usually large groups of people there and every time I've been there on a weekend I've seen at least one birthday celebration. It's definitely not the place to take your grandma for tapas; the crowd is younger and the place is loud and vibrant. They don't get a full 5 stars because the service can be off sometimes and they don't take reservations. \u00a0I was there on a Tuesday night once and the place was relatively empty but our waiter was extremely slow. To make matters worse, he was standing close to our table because we were right by the kitchen and he was just talking to his coworkers while we sat there wanting to order more and needing water refills.

Cafe Iberico is one of those places that has such offerings, specializing in Spanish cuisine. It's large, with 2-3 bar areas, and a decent amount of seating. The ambiance has Spanish-like decor: yellow walls, mirrors and wrought-iron designs plastered all over the walls, marble-like tables, and wood-lacquered chairs. I found the bottles covering the ceiling near the front very intriguing. It gave an otherwise boring ceiling, something to look at. Dress attire is casual, but most patrons wear something a little nicer like a sweater, button-down, or a blouse. Our party of 3 came here for an early dinner. We were initially going to order 8-9 dishes, but the waiter said 2 tapas per person would be good, so we wound up ordering 6 dishes:1) Pulpo A La Plancha ($8.75) - grilled octopus with potatoes and olive oil. The octopus were tender, almost melting in your mouth and full of flavor. Octopus is very hard to prepare, but Iberico did it perfectly, making this mine and everyone else's favorite dish. They added a portion of well-seasoned fries to this dish to make it look more substantial, which was a nice bonus.2) Mejillones a la Marinera ($7.95) - steamed mussels with marinara sauce. The mussels were fresh, plump, and not overcooked. The marinara sauce was light, almost the color penne a la vodka. The sauce was great for dipping the bread into. It was a solid dish, but simple in preparation, not really doing much for me.3) Pincho de solomillo ($7.95) - skewered beef tenderloin with fries & caramelized onions. The beef was tender but did not hold a lot of flavor. I suppose they tried to counterbalance that with the caramelized onions, but these onions were cooked so long that it was as sweet as marmalade. It was almost inedible because of how sweet it was. Definitely not my cup of tea, and I would have preferred the beef to be complimented with a green chimichurri-like sauce.4) Almejas en salsa verde ($8.50) - small clams sauteed with shallots, white wine & parsley. This was downright my second favorite dish, if not my favorite. I have a love for clams, and these clams were perfectly cooked so that they were plump and not shriveled up. The combination of the sweet shallots, similar to an onion, and the white wine made for a superb sauce for both the clams, and to dip my bread in. I found myself dipping as much bread as I could, so that I could savor all that yummy goodness.5) Chorizo y Morcilla ($7.50) - combination platter of grilled Spanish-style sausages, 6 pieces of very thin-sliced chorizo and 2 pieces of blood sausage. The chorizo was overcooked and a bit dried out, making for a very disappointing dish. It didn't have any real heat to it, or any real noticeable spices. For those not familiar with blood sausage, the 2 pieces were mushy in consistency, and is not for everyone. It was good, but nothing from the norm. The portions in this dish were so small, making the dish look practically empty and making me wonder what we were paying for.6) Paella Iberica ($12.95) - a cafe Iberico original served with seafod, chicken & pork. The paella was actually decently sized, much bigger than any of the tapas dishes. It was easily shared among us, with plenty left over. The paella was perfectly cooked with chicken, pork, squid, fish, shrimp, 2 clams, 2 mussels, yellow rice and peas. I was surprised as how delightful this dish was, making this a must try.Service was something lacking, to the point where it was inconveniencing us. And I'm very patient and tolerant. However, the waiter never came to check up on us or clean any of the dishes as each one was brought out. Every time one of the servers came out with another dish, we had to reshuffle everything or he had to ask his buddy to clear some of the dishes, when they were already clearly stacked on top of each other on one side of the table. We'd be waiting there 1-3 minutes each time as they attempted to organize our table, with our help.Cafe Iberico had some hits and misses. The dishes I recommend trying are the Pulpo a La Plancha, Almejas en salsa verde, and the Paella Iberica. Portions were generous for the most part, and tapas were priced very fairly (with the exception of the Chorizo y Morcilla).

The restaurant's 739 N. LaSalle Drive address is not in Lincoln Park as the Google Maps display indicates. It's actually more than 1mile south (just below the intersection of LaSalle & Chicago) in the River North neighborhood. Ok, on with my review...I love Cafe Iberico. The tapas are terrific and the sangria is to die for. It's strong, delicious, and the pitchers are actually a great deal considering how many glasses you get. I just passed a professional exam for the State and went to Iberico to celebrate afterward with a friend. Weekends are crazy here because it's such a popular restaurant and has been on most people's radar forever. Fortunately we went on a Thursday around 6pm so we were seated immediately, had incredibly attentive wait staff, and the kitchen sent our orders out in record time. I didn't get too experimental but did try a new whitefish (that I sadly don't remember the name of) as well as the only mushroom dish on the menu which was very good and had an amazing broth. Other than that, we had a lot of the standards... grilled octopus, beef skewers, goat cheese in tomato sauce, etc and everything tasted great. All-in-all a fun, albeit mildly drunk evening.In contrast, I have been here enough times to know that you can really run the gamut in terms of how easy it is to get seated and attentiveness of the wait staff. It is also loud so I really don't recommend going here on a first date unless maybe during the day when the dining rooms are less full. By 7:30pm, it can get noisy and you'll have a difficult time hearing one another. Still, the food is excellent and the prices are low considering how much variety there is and the size of the portions.Oh, and since I just noticed there was another review warning people not to sit downstairs... I agree that the atmosphere is generally better on the 1st floor but it really depends on what you are looking for. I have requested to be seated downstairs on several occasions because it was simply too loud upstairs and it is more secluded which is nice if you're in a mood for a little privacy. The smaller dining room on the south side of the building is usually pretty good for a mix of atmosphere with a little less noise than you'll get in the larger room passed the bar.", "Date": "2010-07-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Marissa b.", "ReviewID": "83WC5Q4CUOpUZ4yB4yxYeQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Haven't been here in a while but felt the need to give it a review because it's my favorite tapas place in chicago ever!

But that would be unfair. The thing is, Cafe Iberico receives a lot of praise so you go in with high expectations and are disappointed that it doesn't live up to it. I think regulars have an attachment due to the ambiance or whatever sentimental reason and don't really judge it without bias. I was taken there on Wednesday for my birthday and for one, it was waaaaaaaay too loud. The music was so loud the speakers were distorting and everyone in the restaurant was yelling over it to talk. Now, I don't mind loud places, in fact I love them, but this was waaaaay too loud. I mean is it a club or a cafe? The food came quick and hot but the meat was unseasoned and the sauces were not helping. Now, the food was not bad overall, we had pinchos of chicken and steak, some goat cheese dip thing, a squid and fries thing, a smoked salmon dish, patatas bravas and maybe something else. It was all prepared fine, just not great. Average, especially for downtown. This is more of a neighborhood place. Good thing is they don't charge downtown prices. Nice mixed crowd. A few snobs but it is downtown. Nice decor but I could do without the R rated Euro movie playing on the screens that showed full frontals of a man and woman. I like the idea, but I am eating ya know? Overall, an average place that is ok if you don't mind yelling to talk to your date/coherts, and still not being able to hear. Food is ok if you're into average Spanish food. Oh and I forgot to mention, the service is mediocre too. The only reason I go out to eat these days is for the service. Food is food and in Chicago there are plenty of choices. My server although quick forgot that my date, a regular, ask for no potatoes on her squid/octopus dish and he didn't listen. She said it costs more but she was willing to pay as she always does but he failed to accommodate and she was too hungry to send it back. He could have been a little more personable as well.

I figured I'd give it another try since my first experience was ok but couldn't remember the quality of the food. Since '02 I've had tapas at other places inside and outside the city, many of which are great places for dinner. This time around, I couldn't believe the wait time, since they won't take reservations. After an hour plus at the overcrowded bar drinking, at best, average sangria, we headed to our table. The place was packed like a sardine can or cattle car. I figured I order my favorite type of meats; chicken, beef & shrimp. The rest of my friends and family ordered a few more tapas. I have to say, the tapas did come out in portions and in good time. The quality of the food was good but the flavor of it is where I was greatly disappointed. The beef had minimal seasoning and was bland at best. Chicken wings was not far from the beef on taste an flavor. Grilled shrimp was good but digging it out of the shell like looking for gold was messy and killed my appetite. The potatoes in the spicy sauce were nothing more than baked potatoes in a Spanish ketchup. Not spicy at all. If you're looking for tapas in the city, there's other great spots where parking won't be an issue, wait time will be cut down and the sangria will be above average. The flat screens all over the place blasting Spanish pop tunes and Latin hoochie mamas along with the bling bling of the men with their pants halfway down their butts is a nuisance when trying to carry on a conversation with your party. Such a turn off for this type of place.

The location is awesome, the ambiance is different, a little more hipster than anything, but the food is a little above average.The patatas bravas were drowning in sauce, which is usually a good thing for me as I love any dish with tons of flavor, but this one was lacking. The sauce lacked depth, and had kind of an overpowering chorizo and acidic tomatoey taste that I didn't care for. The queso de cabra was wonderful, I'll give them that. Goat cheese usually is spectacular at every Spanish tapas restaurant. The gambas al ajillo were good, but I've had better. Their sausage tapa with chorizo and blood sausage is one of the better dishes almost anywhere though. And as everyone else mentions, the Sangria is top notch, and I'm not really a Sangria or wine person.The paella from Iberico, definitely deserves it's little section though. I've had all types, and all are actually very delicious, with fresh ingredients, and perfectly cooked rice. I'm a big fan of the seafood paella, as they load it up with clams, octopus, squid, shrimp, and lobster if I'm not mistaken. The last time I was there, my brother was getting a little adventurous and decided to choose the Paella Negra which he's had before. It's basically paella with squid and maybe octopus, but it's hard to tell since they take the ink from the squid, and finish the dish off completely, hence the name 'negra'. It was good, aside from the presentation, the dish was just completely black, it was actually pretty tasty. The ink is very subtle and mild, and once you get over the thought of eating it and the color, it's a good change of pace from the usual.I really enjoy the flan here. It's perfectly made as they've been doing it for years, and the caramel sauce has a very nice distinct flavor.The service is unspectacular, but it's expected with the amount of traffic they receive on a daily basis. It is also pretty loud, so if you're looking for a more quiet or romantic dinner, I'd suggest a different place. I'm giving Iberico a 3/5, as it's a solid go-to Tapas location in the city, but definitely not the best. I would recommend making Cafe BaBaReeba your first stop at a Tapas location, and then go to Iberico and compare for yourself.

Iberico is a place to be seen and serves very good tapas (aka Spanish-style appetizers served several at a time). Why $19? Well, no matter how much you order, drinks included, the bill always comes out to about $19 per person -- you'll see! Some of the dishes I'd recommend: garlic mayonnaise potatoes, ham puffs (my favorite), beef tenderloin and spicy red potatoes. There is something for everyone (including you, Aunt Edna) on the menu, so bring your appetite! Just be sure to leave yourself plenty of time when you get there if you have plans later on because the wait can be as long as two hours on any given night. Want to hear a secret?

I basically took one bite, and that was all I could handle. The place was surprisingly packed, for mid-week, and I felt the space could have been somewhat better used, as there was basically nothing going on at the front of the restaurant, apart from the TVs and a bar. More seating could have been placed here, to ease the hemmed in feeling of the back room/event space where we were seated. If it is a birthday you're celebrating, I believe they also throw in a complimentary dessert. Yelp is a family site, so I will only go as far as saying that the banana with two scoops of ice cream, whipped cream detailing and two candles in the ice cream scoops looked phallic, to say the least.

Iberico fulfills all my requirements for a restaurant. I'll admit it is extremely loud but don't forget it is a younger crowd usually. Everything is so clean, from dishes, glasses, utensils and bathrooms. Everything I had there is so flavorful and reasonably priced. And since we're such regulars there I've noticed it is also consistent, never disappointing.Just went to yesterday to a restaurant that had almost 5 stars on yelp and couldn't find one flavorful thing that I can order again next time. Also went to the signature room in january and 400$ later everything was so blend. Here I love everything from their saffron rice scallops to \u00a0 goat cheese marinara, ham wrapped dates, quail paella, grilled octopus ( I never had such soft octopus anywhere). I go a lot to tapas restaurant as I love tapas instead of just having a piece of fish or meat with 2 sides, and by far this is the best. Either you get the cold or hot tappas they're all good. Also I've noticed everywhere that if you ask the waiter for recommendation and they say it's good I take it, if they say I haven't tried it I learned not to order that. Their desserts are really good too especially their specials if you get bored with the ones from the menu. The restaurant I mentioned that had 5 starts here didn't have one decent desert choice.

We brought to the server's (named David M) attention that it was put on the bill.

He came back to the table about 8 minutes later to inform us that he charged $132.00 on a card we asked to have charged only $30.00. Pay attention! I can't stand this crap. He went back to void everything and start over, and wound up charging the $30.00 to the card TWICE! We asked to speak to the manager and he asked for a credit card to fix the mistake. We asked again for the manager and he asked again for the card. The birthday girl then said \"here's an idea, GO GET THE MANAGER!\" He went and got the manager and he handled the situation... Sort of. He explained what happened, which we already fricken knew. He wound up taking 50 bucks off our bill after we had to ASK for some sort of resolution, which after discount was still $302.00.

Back then, we would go often and blitz ourselves on tapas and sangria. The only real complaint back then was how loud it would be because it would *always* be packed. Last night was the first time going there since then and the changes were horribly unbelievable. This place transformed into a dive. We are living in the suburbs now and we decided that we'll chance more than just one glass of sangria. The server would not upgrade our sangria glasses to a 1/2 pitcher and said he'd have to void out the two-glass order. 'So what?!?' we're thinking, they're going to get more money! Duh! We just said 'whatever' and took the glasses. We took one sip and noticed immediately that they were watered down, significantly. When the server gave us the new plates from the adjacent table for our tapas, we noticed that the plates were not cleaned thoroughly. We felt debris/residue on the underside and could see bits on the topside. My wife and I started getting that \"What happened to this place?\" look on our faces. When the tapas did come, it didn't taste flavorful nor did it look appealing. To top it off, one of the plates (chorizo y morcillo) wasn't cooked sufficiently and we contracted food poisoning. We lived in the bathroom the next day wondering if this was enough to file a suit or notify IDPH (IL Dept of Public Health). Before we're done w/ the tapas, we asked the server for the check so we could just pay, eat what's left and get the hell out of there. A complaint to the management would not have been productive because it wasn't about the money. The quality of the visit was horrible compared to then. This place used to be the bomb and everyone in town knew it. But after seeing some recent reviews, I'm not the only one who noticed that things were bad. They must have gotten different chefs and/or different management during the time. What a shame. Lost a once-great hang-out. We will never go back there and I recommend nobody else patrons the place.

I would not recommend this place to anybody looking for a quiet dinner where you can have a quiet conversation whatsoever, but fortunately, that's not what I came for at all! The service was pretty good, fairly attentive, but not fantastic. We sat down at the bar and had some Sangria (HIGHLY recommended!!) while we waited for a table. They have a neat system of displaying names on screens throughout the bar area underneath delightfully euro-trashy music videos when tables are ready, so you can just hang out and enjoy yourself and not have to listen for your name to be called or deal with one of those buzzing lighty uppy \"pager\" things. We ordered 3 tapas and one paella, with the tapas coming out at various times and the paella coming out at the end. All of the food was absolutely delicious, and after 2 half-pitchers of sangria and enough food for at least 3 people (or two very hungry people,) our bill was still only in the $60 range. How cool!

People have mixed opinions about this place it seems. Either you're a fan or you're not. Some say it's too greasy, but I think it all depends on what you order. I, personally, love it.

The meat was cooked to perfection and everything was seasoned well. I must admit that every time I've gone to this restaurant it's been packed to capacity and it's a long wait. While this is great for buisness it can be a bother for patrons attempting to grab a quick bite. If you go to this restaurant on the weekend you should definitely expect to be seated no \u00a0sooner than 45 minutes after arriving.", "Date": "2011-01-29", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jon R.", "ReviewID": "TCED2d95iJaD4JpT7LZbng", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "wide tapas selection & cold beers. the joint is packed on fridays and saturdays, so expect the noise level to be high. parking could be challenging too!", "Date": "2011-02-21", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Yolanda D.", "ReviewID": "8SaZSZ9U4igc8-ZzBqiUQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!

It had been a few years since my last visit and they have changed some things. There is now an actual tapas bar in the front of the restaurant where patrons can select the number of their item and have it delivered to the table. Meanwhile you still get a menu and can order items off the menu as well. I went with a group of four and two went to the front to order while I ordered items off the menu. Needless to say we got a few too many items. That would be a bad thing if everything was not out of this world delicious. Hands down the best items we ordered were the pulpo a la plancha (grilled octopus), fried mussels served on a half shell, the tortilla espanola and the garlic potatoes. We ordered too many items to list here but there was not a dud with any of them. Washed it all down with pitchers of white and red sangria. Total came to $40 per person with generous tip.
