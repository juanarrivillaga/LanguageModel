I went off of a Yelp review, she was referred here by local friends. Wait: Friday evening dinner- about 45 minutes. I strongly recommend putting your pizza order in early so it will be ready after an appetizer.Atmosphere: Loud, energeticStaff: Attentive, difficult to hear over the noise levelFood: The Bruschetta was amazing! The bread was toasted perfectly. It was just a little too much for 2 people.The deep dish 'The Lou' (minus mushrooms) was very good. It was heavy on spinach. The tomatoes were fantastic. The crust is thinner than most other deep dish pizzas- I liked it, but my wife thought it was lacking a little.

BUT I can say that the the pizza here will be something that I will crave for years to come. I went there with a bigger group (9 people) on a Sunday afternoon. It was still hopping, but the wait was only 45 minutes and there were plenty of furniture shops to walk around in the area. We did put our orders for pizzas in, per the hostess' suggestion. We got the large Lou and the Chicago Classic. First of all, they say that a large pizza feeds 4 people. Total bullshit. That thing easily feed like 6 people. And not 6 little petite girls that will normally only eat a salad for lunch. Like 6 people that just did a triathlete and then feel like gnawing their hands off as the hunger hits as the endorphin high fades away (and yes, we were actually in town for a triathlon and we race to eat).But before we get to the pizza, which is making me drool just thinking about, we also ordered 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and a large Malnati salad to munch on while waiting for the pizzas. The mozzarella sticks were just normal apps that you can get anywhere, nothing special, but someone at the table really wanted them. But the salad ... oh the salad. It was delicious! Normally I don't like sweet Italian dressings, but it balances out the saltiness of the salami, olives, and cheese very well. I had to stop eating the salad knowing the pizza was coming. And the pizzas came. Everyone on the table was doubting that 2 pizzas would be enough. And when we were looking at pizzas, we still doubted that it would be enough. But then we all had a slice. And the table went silent. We were too engrossed in the cheese and butter crusts and just the general amazing-ness of what a chicago style pizza should be. I don't think any New York style pizza was able to do what these pizzas did to us. Everyone had 2 slices and were in pain by the time we called uncle. But we still had half a pizza left that we left with the only person that lives in Chicago (he just moved there from DC). The service was amazing. Our waitress made sure that our glasses never went empty. The only thing is that the upstairs room that we were seated in was that it was sooo warm.Hands down, I will go back and am a Lou Malanti fan.

Everybody needs to try this place if you are ever in Chicago. My friend's and I tried probably every major deep dish place in the city and most of us concluded that Lou's had the best pizza.When we came by for lunch it was extremely packed on a Saturday afternoon. The good thing is that you can order your pizza ahead at the counter so that it comes out once you get seated. Just grab a couple beers at the bar and you're set. My party got 2 pizzas here, The Chicago Classic and the Lou.The Chicago Classic had to be one of the best pizzas I have ever had , EVER. What made it unique was the the sausage was a giant patty, not crumbles like you are used to. This gives you a bite of sausage with every bite. The sauce and cheese they use was very good but what sent this pizza over the edge was def the crust. It was so buttery and flaky yet not heavy. The Lou we got since we felt like we needed some veggies. This pizza was ok, I preferred the Veggie pizza at Giordano's but the Lou was still good nonetheless. Besides the pizzas we got the Malnati salad which was very good and an order of bruschetta for an app. The bruschetta ok. Nothing too fancy to talk about. The service here was also top notch. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. She got everything to us quickly and check up on us often to make sure everything was to our likings.

I had been to Gino's East before, but thought maybe I'd try another of the popular joints. This wasn't too far from our hotel, so my mom and I dropped by for lunch. We ended up waiting about 15-20 minutes, so not bad. In fact, you can pre-order your pizza at a counter so that it's baking while you're waiting/getting seated. I was STILL in line when we actually were seated, so I didn't even get to put in my order.We ordered the spinach salad and the Lou's special, which has spinach and tomato. Spinach salad was delicious - came with lots of freshly sliced strawberries, goat cheese, and a balsamic vinaigrette.The pizza was super disappointing. The crust was yeasty and underdone, I believe, and not as buttery flavored as I would have imagined it would be. It was pretty bland and actually...quite healthy tasting. Normally I have one slice of deep dish and that is ENOUGH. My mom and I ended up finishing a small pizza. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. The fact that there was no sauce made this literally cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and crust. It wasn't very well seasoned, so perhaps a more traditional pizza from here would be better. However, it's not helpful to call something a special if it's not very good.We ended up going to Gino's the next day and that was definitely a much more delicious pizza.", "Date": "2014-06-27", "Author_Location": "Lake Forest, CA"}, {"Author": "Dave M.", "ReviewID": "5U44EPRFwvq4a1cszdQjLg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm just visiting Chicago for the summer and had already had Giordano's and Pizzeria Uno, so I figured I would give Lou Malnati's a shot. The short version is that Giordano's is still my favorite.I had the lunch special, which is a salad and a personal pizza with a drink, plus I ordered a starter of garlic bread. The salad was a typical side salad, so nothing good or bad there. To be fair, I love me some garlic, but the garlic bread seemed somewhat bland. Definitely needed the marinara sauce on the side to help give it some flavor. The pizza itself was good, but not as good as Giordano's, IMO. On the plus side, the lunch special is available on the weekends at Lou Malnati's, which is not true for Giordano's, so if that's what you're after, then Lou Malnati's is not a bad option.

My mom and I were deliberating for too long (not that there are many choices...), so they called us to our table before we were \"ready.\"We finally decided on two smalls -- one Chicago Classic and one \"Lou\" with sausage. We also got a Malnati's salad, since our wait was going to be substantial. The salad was sweet and alright -- nothing special. I was a little overwhelmed by the Gorgonzola. When the pizzas came, I honestly couldn't taste much of a difference between the two, which was disappointing. The crust was thin, crispy, and flaky, but everything inside the pizza was lacking in flavor and slid off the crust. Nothing was adhered to anything else, so eating it was strange and disconnected. The spinach in the pizza also caused it to be really watery. Overall, I was disappointed. The pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either.

YAHHH!!! \u00a0Sensory satisfaction! \u00a0I ate that slowly, initially thought I'd save some to go, but nope! \u00a0It was too good.The pizza itself. \u00a0Individual size, which at first looked small, but then again it was deep dish where size is deceiving when compared to thin crust. \u00a0Sausage was delicious, a mild blend of Italian spices and very juicy. \u00a0The cheese, sauce, tomato... so much better than I remembered! \u00a0I was more full than I anticipated and took the last two slices to go, which did NOT make it back to the hotel since I finished them off before I got there! \u00a0VERY good.I am sure you can search Chicago up and down for the very best, primo deep dish eatery. \u00a0There may be one or three out there. \u00a0But for me, Lou Malnati's hit the mark with each item they delivered to my table. \u00a0I'm glad I included Malnati's on my trip to Chicago! \u00a0Prices were reasonable, menu options ALL look appealing, and the staff treated me, as a single diner, very well. \u00a0Cheers!", "Date": "2014-04-30", "Author_Location": "Tucker, GA"}, {"Author": "Cassie V.", "ReviewID": "3vM_sL92iOBGfgoc6aNkpQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Be ready to wait! It is walk-in only, of a smallish location in hotel central.With that said, if you find yourself wanting deep dish near your hotel, go to Lou Malnati's, it is still my favorite deep dish. Go here especially if you are visiting Chicago and haven't made reservations anywhere else. Two reasons: 1) Deep dish dinner is a must and 2) You are seriously going to wait over an hour (if not much more) at any restaurant if you did not make any other reservation. I plead with the tourists who come here, do not complain about the wait! It is like that everywhere. Plan ahead or plan to wait.I only give this location 3 stars instead of 4 because I have been to the Gold Coast location which is just better. It's bigger so the line goes quicker. This location is just smaller, and filled with out of towners who (rightfully) want some Chicago Pie. No foul on the tourists, just makes it busier in a busy city. For a seating of five, on a Friday night, it took 1 hour 20 mins before we were seated (read: not that bad for the area). The food is good. We had picky eaters in the bunch whose palates haven't grown in yet apparently because they didn't think their thin crust cheese pizza was as good as little ceasars, but they were wrong. It was good for a plain cheese pizza.The deep dish my family ordered had pepperoni, green pepper, onion, sausage and sliced tomatoes. Very good in the buttery crust. Personally I don't like pepperoni in my deep dishes but it was a consensus so I didn't fight it. Our waitress was a gem. Kate(ie?) Just cool, always was around when we needed her, had an eye on our refills.Final note: While you wait, you can put in your order for pizza. They will cook it most of the way and then finish it off when you are seated and ready to feast. This is a good gig because deep dish can take upwards of 45 mins to cook, so it double duties the waiting time for the food by ordering before you're seated.Thanks for taking the time to read before you feed!

As pretty much a life-long Chicago-ian, I would say my intake of deep dish depend strictly on the number of out-of-towners that pass through this glorious city. So when time comes to satisfy the curiosities of the passing by tourist, my preference is to set time aside for Lou Malnati's offering. I have tried both the Lou and the Chicago Classic, and I would say that these offerings are for the most part really consistent. The pie is a bit shallow in comparison to other deep dish offerings in the city, but I think it allows the person to safely enjoy 2 slices without feeling like a blob afterwards. I like the sausage that they use on the pizza on the Chicago classic. It is not too oil or salty, and is works in good harmony with the bed of tomatoes that accompany it. The Lou is a good choice with people not too fond of sausage, and provides a nice mixture of mushrooms and spinach (both favorites of mine in deep dish). The crust (which is the main standout in differentiating the different pizzerias), is much lighter and crispier than other places. I'm not a fan of very doughy crusts so this maybe my bias in this regard. The appetizers and salads are a nice change of pace from the huge hearty pizzas, but I'm not sure it's really worth it. I don't mind skipping them, and I don't mind having a side of light salad. Just kind of a big \"meh.\"We tried the thin crust pizza with pepperoni. I think my bias against pepperoni may have shifted my opinion, but there were a few fundamental problems with the offering. The pepperoni was layered underneath the cheese, stretching across the entire pizza. I think that's too much pepperoni to pizza ratio. The pizza was also brought out a bit cold. The cheese had already hardened by the time I got to it, and the crust was a bit hard. While it wasn't awful, I would definitely stay away from it next time. Overall, I think there are very small differences in the many deep dish pizzas in Chicago. However, I would say that Lou's is my favorite (although, due to the proximity to my apartment, it is not my go-to). The ingredients are quality, the pricing is very fair, and the overall experience (besides the long expected wait times) is consistent and good. So if you're in need of a decent deep dish offering, I would definitely recommend giving Lou Malnati's a try.", "Date": "2014-03-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Gary S.", "ReviewID": "6BPdCyCYS0DucemBXK9LTg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great service and best damn pizza I've ever had.

It takes about 30 minutes to get your casserole, so be patient, grab a beer, and enjoy your company.Once your casserole arrives, your server will chop up your initial pieces, and then its game time. The crust is crispy, flaky, and oh so buttery. The sauce is rich with flavor, and will knock your socks off. The large chunks of italian sausage will not leave you wanting. And to top it off, slices of crispy pepperoni complete the absolutely amazing casserole.We liked it so much we ordered a bunch to take back with us to LA (ask your server on the best way to do it).I had a great experience here, and will definitely be coming back in the near future.", "Date": "2013-12-24", "Author_Location": "West Covina, CA"}, {"Author": "Katy S.", "ReviewID": "xWAsxyKVF3Hqrj6893kNYw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just tried Lou's for the first time last night. I just moved to Chicago a month ago and have already tried Pequod's so the other pizza joints are really going to have to \"wow\" me after P's. Unfortunately, Lou's was a major fail. I walked in before my friend met me there. I asked for a table for two. They wouldn't sit me until he arrived. The restaurant was virtually empty! What kind of sh*t is that? Not cool. I begged to place the order before he got there so it could be ready in a relatively reasonable time after he arrived. \u00a0They supposedly put in the order. However, after he finally showed and after we sat down, we STILL waited another 50 minutes for the \"famous\" Lou's pizza to come out. First of all, we had ordered a medium. What a huge mistake. It was huge. It could've easily fed four, maybe three fatties haha. Second of all... wait, wait, before I get to that...Is it me or is a pizza supposed to have four specific things: dough, sauce, cheese, and whatever other crap you choose to put on your pie (\"toppings\"). Well, it was missing one very very vital thing! ...Sauce, sauce, where art thou?! It was seriously just dough, a massive amount of cheese, pepperoni, and GREASE. So much grease that I had to take napkins and soak it up in order to 'enjoy' a slice. [this was my second of all rant]Third: Taste test! The pizza tasted okay but definitely does not win the crown for Chicago's best deep dish.

Yes, I loved a salad at a pizza place. And the pizza itself was good also. Three stars-good probably. With that and the salad love I'd probably be writing a 4-star review if not for the service. We stopped in on a Friday afternoon... thinking we'd miss the lunch rush around 2pm. No such luck, but we got inside quickly (the line soon snaked outside into the blustery street). Per a recommendation from the hostess, we pre-ordered our pizza before even sitting down. Small deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom! Seating came soon thereafter, maybe 10 minutes, and we were off and running. Our server was not super personable - but obviously busy so that's understandable. We order up some beers, the salad, and started waiting.And waiting.And waiting.Then the salad came. Beers meanwhile needed replacing. Waiting...Waiting......2nd round of beers show up and the table next to us sits down. Then more waiting. I won't bore you anymore with the copious waiting we experienced, but when the adjacent table got their pizza before us, I'd had enough. We flagged down our hustling server and ask what's up. The only response is, 'yeah it should be out soon'. I agreed. It should be. It better be. (I'm actually angry at this point).When our pie finally showed, no apologies were offered, even though the aforementioned 'other table' had already finished eating theirs.

EVER. and also, SAUSAGE CRUSTED PIZZA (not on the menu, you have to ask for it)! the atmosphere of this place is killer, feels like where Al Capone would do his business if he wanted to eat pizza while he was doing so. there's a bar by the entrance with a couple people watching baseball on TV, and further inside it's slightly dim with sports memorabilia all over the walls. It definitely has an old-school feel to it, which i absolutely loved! we walked in on a wednesday at 4pm with a party of 3, because we heard the line and wait gets pretty bad later on. we went with a Chicago native who comes to Lou's pretty often, and says it's one of his favorite places! we got seated right away, and there were already a few parties inside enjoying their deep dish, and it looked thick and delicious!!! \u00a0the decor makes it appear much less like a family establishment than Girodano's, and more like where middle aged Chicagoans come to play poker or enjoy cigars. but there were quite a few families inside. our waiter was extremely friendly and answered all the questions we had. we ordered a Lou's deep dish, and since my boyfriend is gluten free, they offered a standard 10'' gluten free pizza, or they revealed to us a CRUSTLESS PIZZA, where sausages ARE the crust!!! I had no idea how that would work, but we were about to find out! \u00a0pizzas come in the size of small, medium, large, and extra large. our waiter warned us that the crustless pizza is some heavy stuff, and that a medium size would be a hike, but the large would be a trek... so we went for the large!!one bite into the deep dish and i was SOLD. it was PACKED with fresh, gooey cheese and the toppings were so savory and flavorful! Also, the crust was just thick enough to still feel like a crust but have the texture of really tender bread. and one bite into the crustless pizza, my boyfriend was in HEAVEN! he ate almost the entire pizza by himself! the sausages were molded into crust form, and it was packed tight with cheese, with additional mushroom and peppers on top! it was some legitimate sausage crust, and definitely one of the most innovative pizzas I've ever had! it had about twice the flavor of the deep dish pizza, but that's probably because the sausages are super salty and there is no bread to mediate... INTENSE STUFF!you can tell all the ingredients are fresh, and the crustless pizza is perfect for those who are allergic to gluten but still want a packed mouthful of flavors! GF pizza crusts tend not to be very good... so why not get rid of it entirely!? pizzas take a while to make as they are fresh, so if you are starving maybe some salad will hold you over... the service is wonderful and the waiters personally serve each slice to you, although we started serving ourselves because it personally feels awkward to be waited on.

I'm not a pizza person, really, hardly ate it back home unless someone else insisted on getting one. So, first day out we came to LM's for the famed Chicago deep dish. We had \"The Lou\" which featured marinara sauce, cheese, spinach, and mushrooms topped with slices of fresh tomatoes. The pizza came out piping hot (so do let it cool a bit, lest you want to burn your tongue and kill all the taste buds along with the burn). The first bite of the gooey cheese oozing and steaming along with the tomato, sauce, etc. did not disappoint. It made my taste buds do a little dance! The crust was light and buttery in spite of its thickness. Loved it, I dare say! A great start for our Chicago experience. Only complaint here was that the sauce was not evenly distributed so that portions near the edge were lacking this deliciousness. This was Sunday lunch.Then after a horrible experience at another deep dish joint, we returned on Wed for lunch to erase the bad taste from our mouths and memories. This time we had a half-&-half, \"The Lou\" and pepperoni/sausage/mushroom combo, with extra sauce. While the toppings were still perfectly done, given it was half/half the tomato slices were smaller in order to fit in the tinier space. And while the crust was still good, it was not as light and buttery as the one we had on Sunday...go figure. Still we enjoyed it very much. I have to say we like LM better than the others we've tried, not just in Chicago but elsewhere also. For deep dish, LM is the one to beat. Off course we didn't try its other locations, but it sure makes for a great reason to try them all. Too bad, we had to leave and couldn't get to them.For the 3 of us, we ordered the small (we're light eaters). Medium in deep dish would have been way too much, and we couldn't deal with leftovers at the hotel. Am I now converted to deep dish? ...only in Chicago at LM's.One minor complaint, the hostess on Wed was not very nice to us. For every table she led customers to, she'd lay out the menus in front of each place setting, but she simply tossed the 3 menus onto the center of the table for us.

It's hard to cite hard facts, as it's been awhile since I've visited another Chicago pizza parlor (one visit per trip home is about all my diet can handle), but my gut tells me the prices are more reasonable than most as well.Finally, be sure to check out the jerseys all over the walls.

Not too much crust, just enough. Then a layer of sausage, a generous layer of cheese, and then topped with tomato sauce. Simple, but delicious. You wait half an hour after ordering, and then it comes out to you, a hot pie, with a crisp almost crumbly crust.

The salad is tossed with sweet vinaigrette dressing, gorgonzola, salami, olives, tomatoes, mushrooms and romano cheese. \u00a0I'd definitely order it again without any changes. \u00a0The menu says it serves 3-4 people, but our table of six all had enough salad. \u00a0-Calamari: \u00a0I'm a calamari freak. \u00a0I don't know why, but I almost always tend to order calamari at pizzerias. \u00a0The calamari wasn't the best, but I would order it again because I lurve (love) calamari and the marinara sauce was delicious and fresh.-The \"Lou\" (vegetarian) deep dish: \u00a0let me just say this... No one at the table was vegetarian, but everyone liked it. \u00a0My manfriend even preferred it over the sausage-laden \"Classic\" deep dish that we also ordered. \u00a0This pizza was a happy marriage of delectable mushrooms, spinach, cheese, tomater sauce, and thinly-sliced tomatoes on top. \u00a0I'm not big on tomaters so I did begin sliding them off of my pizza. Sorry I'm not sorry.-The \"Classic\": \u00a0oh, hellllllo you sausage-y goodness, you. \u00a0This Classic was jacked up on lean sausage, tomater sauce, and lots o' \u00a0cheese. \u00a0This pizza was perfect. \u00a0Probably due to the leanness of the sausage, the sausage actually had a good bite to it. Still perfect and I'd order this baby up again!The service was perfect and I never had to play Where's Waldo to locate my waiter since he was very on top of things, especially considering how jam-packed this place was on a Thursday night. \u00a0Water was filled at all times and he did a nice job of serving us the pizzas once they came out. \u00a0One thing they really can improve on is having a bigger bathroom. \u00a0C'mon!

Good thing we ordered the spinach stuffed bread appetizer, the 30 minute wait can be most excruciating when you're stomach is about to tear itself apart out of pure hunger. The bread was moist, and the spinach inside wasn't overpowering at all.When the pizza arrived and we took our first bite, I could immediately tell that the \"butter crust\" was worth every calorie. It gave the crust a nice sheen, a buttery aroma, and a light and crispy crunch when my teeth dug right in. Inside, the smooth and velvety cheese just melted and ooozed through, giving the pepperoni and mushrooms just that extra burst in flavor. I was happy that there were no signs of uncooked or squishy \"dough,\" so common in many flawed deep dish pizzas. Three big slices and a couple refills of diet Cokes later, I was done. DONE. Each slice practically weighed a pound each. I needed a siesta big time, to lay my head down on something, anything. Back to the hotel, we go.

Knowing Chicago deep dish takes about 45 minutes to make, I quickly ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and patiently waited for my friends to arrive. The Lou's on Wells is a popular tourist spot and there were some English folks enjoying their pizza and a large group of tourists with cameras more advanced than mine. Crowded and family-friendly, there were several strollers rolling around the place. TVs in the background televised the Dallas-Oklahoma City matchup while some tables around were slicing into their pies.The appetizer that arrived was Lou Malnati's three cheese bread. Upon seeing this behemoth, my jawk dropped! I didn't really read the menu and thought I was ordering bread sticks or something. Instead this giant loaf of bread dropped down on the table and it was a welcome sight as I hadn't eaten all day. The bread was crisp but could have used a bit of garlic, but overall a solid appetizer.The moment of truth had finally arrived right on our table. Lou's renowned butter crust has been a staple of the deep dish circuit over the better part of the past thirty years and this was the place to be. Picking up my knife and carving into the piece of pie, I could hear the crispiness of the crust as I cut into it. Starving, the pizza was worth the salt and the extra pepperoni added some additional flavor.

And who wants soggy microwaved slice of pizza that was a shell of what it was in texture and flavor? So we waited...45 minutes later, a pizza stand was assembled before us and our pizza radiating with its heat and tantalizing smells was set atop.

Okay, except Chinese restaurants because literally you sit down and your food comes in a minute...yea I'm Chinese and I don't even know how they do it.The wait was about an hour, not too bad - but it was pretty bad if our insides were eating us alive because we were THAT hungry. Luckily, our breaded mushrooms appetizer came in a flash. The breaded mushrooms were pretty good. It was lightly breaded and crispy. The mushrooms were fresh. Wow I must admit, I really do love mushrooms!For 3 really hungry girls, we've ordered two 6 inch deep dish pizzas. One is the Malnati's Chicago Classic, a special house sausage, with extra cheese and vine ripen tomato sauce in butter crust. The other deep dish we've gotten was the vegetable pizza because one of the girls is a vegetarian. Okay, so the sausage pizza was just okay. The vegetable pizza was actually pretty good - veggies gave it more texture and crunch, which the pizza itself lacked. The butter crust, well it was buttery, but I wasn't too fond of it. Maybe the New Yorker me is spoiled by pizzas in NYC and found this deep dish pizza overrated? For dessert, we've ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizza, a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie prepped in a deep dish pizza pan, topped with vanilla ice cream and loads of whipped cream. The dessert was pretty good, the warm cookie with the combination of ice cream was super! The vanilla ice cream was not white, but it has a hint of orange coloring.To be really honest, I felt the mushrooms and the dessert were the best highlight of that entire meal.

Impossible unless you're eating stuff crust pizzas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner which would be pretty disturbing.We decided to give Lou's a shot since it had plenty of positive reviews and most importantly, it was in walking distance from our hotel. Giordano's delivered an amazing stuff crust pizza a few days before so now Lou Malnati's had to prove something.When we arrived for dinner, you betcha there was a lovely wait. People were crowded everywhere; from the waiting area inside, to the bar, and even outside on the streets. I don't want to know how everyone huddles together when the whether is extremely cold but I was glad I wasn't there to witness it. We put in our order for our stuff crust pizza which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED while we waited. Remember, it takes a good half an hour for it to come out so if you order it at the table, you're only wasting valuable time.When we were finally given a table, we were seated outside in their make shift patio if you want to call it that. Good thing the night wasn't too cold, it was a perfect 50 something degrees under clear skies. We were hungry so it really didn't matter where we sat at that point.To start, I ordered the soup of the day which was the corn chowder. They need to put that bad boy permanently on their menu. It was one of the better corn chowders I have tasted. If it's available the day you dine here, give it a try especially if you're a fan of chowder like myself. Another app we ordered was the Malnati salad. Our waitress said that this was a great choice even though in the back of my mind I was questioning: how salads can be possibly that great? Little did I know that the Malnati salad lived up to her words. Whether it was the potent and effective gorgonzola cheese or their classic Lou's dressing, the bowl was spotless after we were done with it. The medium size was more than enough to share between two people.Don't laugh, but that stuff crust pizza I ended ordering was the smallest size they had which was the individual. Although a pretty good pizza, I think I should have at least went with the small size. By comparing my pizza to others around me, I felt like the individual sized pizza lacked something on the grand scale whereas the bigger sizes had that intimidating stuff crust cheese spewing I was hoping to find. Noted for when I return: go with at least a small and bag the rest for to-go if you can't finish it. Still, The \"Lou\" pizza was still a tasty treat.To top off our dinner, we had the individual serving of the chocolate chip pizza. Think of the pizookie from BJ's. Chocolate chip cookie baked in an iron clad pizza pan topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. I like how you have the option to order this smaller size and not have to deal with that fattening regular size we're so use to getting. I think I may have liked this more than the pizookie actually. It takes about 10 minutes to come out so you may want to order this slightly beforehand. It was a great closer to our meal at Lou's.With all our own positive feedback from all the items we sampled this night, I will have to say that I am truly going to miss Lou Malnati's.

Errr . . . But that's just because Lou's pizza is so popular. And why? Because IT'S THE BEST. The crust is buttery and delicious in every way, the cheese is melted to the perfect level of stringiness, there's just enough of that undeniably savory tomato sauce -- and the sausage is just indescribable. Only Lou does this just right.So get used to it: You have to plan your trip to Lou Malnati's. Eat breakfast and be prepared to wait until 2:00 for lunch. The smallest size they have is just enough for two people, no matter what it says on the menu about it being suitable for one (unless you're a bear).

Go around the corner to Starbucks and satiate your wait hunger with some plain coffee or iced tea, then suck it up and wait for Lou's.

He compared several main ones around the Chicago area and decided Lou Malnati's was the one we needed to eat at.On Thursday night, we arrived at Lou Malnati's around 6 PM with many available seating opened and were seated right away. We glanced through the menu for a bit and decided to start with their Spinach stuffed bread. It sounded good and something \u00a0I had not had before. For our entree, we decided on a small peperoni and mushroom deep dish. Yes, even though we are big eaters and love food, a small deep dish was all we needed.When the spinach stuffed bread arrived, it just looked like a mini loaf \u00a0of bread but once we sliced it as we do with bread, it was filled with gooey cheese and spinach. It was so delicious and comforting that it was gone within two minutes.I suggest ordering an appetizer while waiting for your deep dish because it takes about 30-40 mins until the pizza is ready. It was fine with us since we had time to digest the stuffed bread. The pizza was cheesy, and filled with fresh ingredients you can taste. It was the most wonderful deep dish I had.

I wanted to see what was so great about this pizza! The place was pretty packed for a Tuesday night. We had to wait about 35 mins for our table. We finally got seated and ordered our food. We ordered the large deep dish deluxe pizza for the 5 of us, and another coworker ordered a sandwich with fries. We also ordered a salad which came pretty quickly. However the pizza and the sandwich took over and hour and 15 mins to come. I know that usually the pizza takes about 30 mins to cook - but over an hour was ridiculous! I was trying to find our waitress to ask about our food, but she was no where to be found. I finally asked another waitress about our food, and about 10 mins later our food finally came. The pizza was unimpressive. It tasted a little undercooked, and it was just basically a big slab of dough, piled with lots of toppings. On top of that - my coworkers fries came out cold. I had to ask another waitress to get hot fries - which the manager actually brought us a new basket of hot fries. After we finished eating we waited around 30 mins- we just wanted to pay the bill but no one was around to help. I literally walked around the restaurant hoping to get anyone's attention. Finally we got our bill - with gratuity tacked on the bill. I doubled checked the menu and gratuity is only automatically added on for parties 8 or more - there was only 6 of us. Now after all this, I was pretty upset - never had I had this poor service before and now they messed up on our bill? I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was extremely apologetic after I told him everything that had happened - and he offered to comp our bill. I would only give the food 1 star - because it just was not very good pizza - perhaps we ordered the wrong thing? Maybe there was something that tasted better. I don't think I would want to try \"deep dish\" pizza again though. But I gave this place an extra star because the manager's service - he acknowledged the poor service from our waitress, apologized, and took care of our bill.

I'll go outside to inside:The famous butter crust --- I was imaging something buttery as in light and airy and greasy. This was butter as in a dessert tart and hard. I was not a fan.The tomato sauce --- The use real tomatoes in the sauce and I liked that, but tomatoes have a high water content that ran into the pizza. Again, was not a fan of. Overall, I liked the quality of this component.The cheese --- A lot of it, but no different than any other pizza cheese. They just put a little more on it.The pepperoni --- I thought the quality was better than most pizzas, a little thicker.The sausage --- The second most disappointing part of the pizza next to the crust. Large chucks, but very bland. It needed fennel. Overall, I think it's better than LA pizza, but not NY. NY pizza has a smoky flavor that develops in the cooking process that I dig.

we opted for Lou's.Arriving just after 1:00pm the patio was open but we opted to eat indoors at the River North location on Wells Street. \u00a0Greeted promptly by a friendly young waitress who I honestly couldn't believe was old enough to serve a beer, our waters were filled quickly and my sister opted for a local Goose Island 312 while my aunt and mother chose their standard iced tea. \u00a0Orders placed we sat and waited while examining the kitschy bar interior and laughing as the crowd burst into boos while watching the Yankees put up a few runs on the White Sox. \u00a0Waiting for about 10 minutes we were brought our first item, Lou's Bruschetta with fresh chopped tomato and basil tossed with olive oil and served with homemade garlic toast. \u00a0Excellent and crisp Italian toast with a mild although notably clean tasting olive oil and subtle use of garlic was matched well by the impressively fresh tomatoes and aromatic basil. \u00a0While it wasn't listed, I detected a bit of rosemary in the dish that added additional complexity. \u00a0At less than $5 the portion was generous and the quality excellent.Finishing our bruschetta it was another 20 minutes before the young lady arrived to tell us our pizza would be out soon. \u00a0Interestingly, my mother began sorting plates from the center of the table at this time and noted one to be quite dirty. \u00a0Showing this to the server the server stated \"hmm, well, all our plates are in the washer now but I'll see if I can find one.\" \u00a0With nearly twenty Lou's operating in Illinois, I'd like to think their flagship would have a bit more tableware - or that someone in the place could hand wash a dish.Arriving in about 10 minutes, along with a fresh plate, was our main event - a medium Lou with Buttercrust, Fresh spinach, mushrooms and sliced tomatoes covered with a blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese. \u00a0 Served in prototypical deep-dish glory the pie came steaming hot with cheese still bubbling and the thick buttery crust layered all the way to the top of the pan. \u00a0An intoxicating aroma I had to bear in mind the temperature to make sure I didn't burn my mouth digging in. \u00a0Slicing the pizza with an enormous pizza cutter we were each plated a hefty slice and waters and teas were refilled. \u00a0Not quite as traditional as the standard sausage/cheese variety of deep dish, this glorious pile of cheese and veggies topped with a hearty tomato sauce was quite excellent with a great juxtaposition of buttery, creamy, savory, sweet, and crunchy. \u00a0While the sauce wasn't quite as impressive as Art's, the use of multiple cheeses added a lot of nuance to the dish and really set it apart from \"other\" Chicago Pizzas - the whole tomatoes and garlicky mushrooms were also excellent and I particularly loved the butter crust as it was crisp on bite but gave way to the teeth and nearly melted in the mouth. \u00a0 While the menu stated a \"medium\" would be enough for 3, the heft of this pie made that a challenge that took some time to complete - with myself doing most of the legwork. \u00a0When the meal ended we were asked if we'd like dessert - and while I still do regret not experiencing the deep dish chocolate chip cookie, I had dinner plans with an old friend at North Pond later in the evening and didn't want to chance it. \u00a0All told really enjoyed Lou's and the price can't be beat - were it not for the beverages we'd have likely been out of there under $25 all inclusive. \u00a0While I must say I liked Art's Pizza better, the service and style at Malnati's was excellent and it'd be a great place to catch a game with friends. \u00a0A long walk back to Millennium Park interrupted by more shopping was a great way to close out the trip with my family and I'm glad we had a chance to try Lou's. \u00a0Gino's East or Uno is next.", "Date": "2009-08-10", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Larry M.", "ReviewID": "EQT02x8B6mCs2JpX3sNJzw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took an hour and a half for delivery, but it was worth it.I have tried many different places for deep dish and decided to try Lou's tonight. \u00a0Had the \"Lou\" and a sausage.Pizza here is an art form, and Lou's measures up. \u00a0The pizza was so good and topped with top quality ingredients. \u00a0Their sausage was good too. \u00a0It was sweet and not oily and gross like I get in LA. \u00a0Everything was so good I froze it and brought the leftovers home in my luggage.Good stuff, too bad there is not one in LA.", "Date": "2010-09-25", "Author_Location": "Valencia, CA"}, {"Author": "April C.", "ReviewID": "uf1etu1QmvYNPj04USjuAg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first and only Chicago deep dish pizza experience.

I was in Chicago on a trip a few weeks ago and ordered a personal size deep dish pizza to go. I had high expectations, having heard great things about Chicago pizza. I ordered over the phone and walked over to the restaurant to pick it up. It took about 30 minutes for my pizza to arrive - this was not a good start. When I ate the pizza a few minutes later in my hotel, I was very disappointed. This was a sausage pie and the sausage overshadowed every other aspect of the pizza. There was basically a giant piece of chewy, salty, tasteless meat taking up the entire radius of the pie, covered with a thick layer of gummy cheese. Under this was a skimpy lawyer of tomato sauce. Not only were the proportions way off, but none of the components tasted particularly good individually. The sum of these parts was even worse. In an effort to sate myself for the coming flight home, I ended up pulling the meat patty off of the pizza and trying just the crust. This was similarly unappetizing.

Pizza pot pie? Sounds.. different! Since the place he went to was too far from where we were staying, we strolled over to Lou Malnati's pizzeria...

She wasn't very informed on the beer selection, however her recommendation ended up being what I was craving. We started off with some garlic bread and salad appetizers. The salad was good, not GREAT... Just, good. It would've been great if she would've let us know about the bleu cheese so this is just another example of how uninformed our waitress was of the menu. We also had some garlic bread which was warm and toasty, not over indulged in butter and garlic. After a 45 minute wait, finally the deep dish pizza arrives. We ordered the sausage one and decided to go with the small portion which my friends, was enough! It's cut into 4 and even with an appetite I was only able to finish one slice. Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza is reminiscent of the pizza hut and I say this because of the similarity of the crust, which also happened to be really thin. Deep dish pizza is literally the recipe for heartburn! At least this one was. Luckily I happen to like lots of tomato sauce but this was out of control.

This specialty pizza has spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms, with a blend of cheeses. The wine was brought to our table already open, which was highly unusual.

The toppings were fresh and flavorful, the crust was flaky and delicious, and the tomato sauce was just right. The price was reasonable, too, especially compared with other deep dish joints around town (see my other pizza reviews).

I'm really sad to report that it was not at all the same experience whatsoever. In fact, I would say this was the worst service I've ever experienced anywhere.This time, the wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed by the crowd and were doing a tag team operation and \"helping\" each other. After waiting over 30 minutes for my deep dish pizza, the minimum wait time for a standard deep dish, a waiter who was not our server delivered our pizza to another table. There was a pretty clear language barrier, which did not help the situation. Since Lou's personally serves each guest their first slice, they doled out my pizza to another family, who immediately started devouring it.The other family's pizza came out to us, of course, which we immediately alerted the server of. It was offered to us, but it looked disgusting and had extra cheese, which is just not necessary on a deep dish pie. Not surprisingly, based on the service that night, this server who brought our pizza was not the server who took our order. Had it been our original waitress, this whole situation could have easily been avoided. Once we called our original waitress over, she was very flustered at the situation and brought over her manager. Now, if you were the manager, who would you address first? The people who are already eating a pizza, of which they clearly could not recognize or care was their own OR the people who are sitting pizzaless, hungry, and annoyed at the situation? This manager opted for the first. Absolutely ridiculous. Said manager seemed confused as to what to do, and gave more attention to the the table who now had 2 total pizzas, versus my table with none. She went over to the family who received my pizza and apologized to them, even though it was clear that they were stuffing their faces anyways, and did not care. Her first interaction with my table was asking us, \"Did you guys eat any of this one?\" in regards to the pizza we incorrectly received. It was visible that we hadn't, and told her we hadn't, to which she replied, \"Cool!\" and then proceeded to give that family the pizza they originally ordered, in addition to ours. How rude! She then disappeared into the kitchen for several minutes. When she finally reemerged, she wondered out to tell us that they were making our pizza a top priority and jumping it in the line of orders. She didn't once apologize to us, and she acted annoyed at us, even though it wasn't our fault. Maybe she expected us to just accept the pizza we didn't order? Whatever the reason, the customer should come first, and this was not the priority of this manager.I was visiting from out of town and then had to wait a whole additional 30 minutes. This really took a chunk out of my night that was set out for exploring the city. I was not at all pleased about this. We ate quickly once we finally got the pizza we ordered to begin with. Our original server was very nice and extremely apologetic throughout, while her manager remained apathetic about the whole situation.Ready for the kicker? We were finishing our last slices of pizza and our waitress came over and dropped off a check. Are you even kidding me? They had actually billed us for two pizzas, and zeroed both off of the check, giving the illusion that we had saved $30 or something. Since we were aware of the wait time, I ordered a beer and a fried calamari appetizer before the meal. I didn't really want either, but some time had passed since lunch, and I wanted to get started on something. It ended up that this is what we were being charged for, including my girlfriend's drink, which came to a total of an additional $25 or so. I couldn't believe they had the nerve to charge us for anything! We were in their restaurant a total of over TWO WHOLE HOURS! How could they have the nerve to try to charge us for anything. The waitress came back around again and I asked her to speak with the manager again, to which she responded, \"Oh, is there something wrong with the check?\" to which I replied, \"Yes. The fact that there is one.\" She looked confused and ran off to grab the same unhelpful manager from earlier, who also appeared confused as to what additional problems there could be. Was it really that surprising? Really?!?!?I told her that it was ridiculous that we had to wait that long, that we were from out of town and our night was ruined, that it was insane to charge us for anything, etc. This dismissive jerk of a manager walked away from our table, while I was expressing our displeasures, which was even more infuriating. This, of course, caused a small scene, to which I walked straight out.I couldn't believe the service I had just received. It was by far the absolute worse service I have ever experienced from any public restaurant, grocery store, retail store, or anywhere ever, really.

One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's. For me, Lou Malnati's came in a very close second place, just behind Giordano's. The deep dish pizza here is definitely very different from the other 3 places. The slices are smaller, and the crust is thinner (so take note that you should probably order more than you normally would at the other deep dish places). It also seems like, instead of overwhelming you with an enormous, thick slice of pizza, Lou's takes a more refined approach. And boy did it work. The flavors were perfect, and the butter crust was delicious (not an easy feat - most of the other butter crusts I had on this trip were thick, dry, and just plain excessive). We got here around 7:30 PM on a Sunday. We were quoted for a 90 minute wait, but got inside in less than an hour (funny how an hour-long wait became something to celebrate). After that, it took another 40 minutes or so for the pizza to get to our table. One negative was that, instead of leaving the pizzas at our table, the waiter kept it on a tray by the wall, which means that we had to wait for him to come by every time to refill our plates. I don't know if we were allowed to just walk over and get our own slices or what, but that was kind of just a strange thing, and since the restaurant was crowded, we ended up sitting around waiting for more pizza, which should not have happened. So the service wasn't the best, but it was tolerable. However, the ambience was the best of the four pizzerias that I visited - just a nice, clean place to enjoy great pizza.Make the journey now!

So far, I've eaten at two, Lou's and Giordano's. Lines were never an issue as my trip was in January and I would either eat early or late. So I had two things working in my favor, time and season. Lou's was my favorite of the two. You HAVE to get the butter crust. It wasn't overly flaky or dry. It was crispy and yet saturated in butter. It was amazing. The cheese oozed out and really melted in your mouth. The interior was nice wood architecture and tile. They had some cool jerseys that were signed and on the walls. Besides the food and the decor, the staff was all super nice. Every person was really friendly and made the visit really pleasant.Giordano's was a great pizza. It wasn't as good as Lou's but it was still really good. The crust is thick and a dominant feature in the pizza. It was very flaky. I liked having the butter crust from Lou's more. The cheese was good but it wasn't as succulent as Lou's. I will say, that Giordano's had better sauce. It was really sweet and tasty. I thought it was a great flavor for pizza.

No mention of price or the salad and drink that is included in the deal. (And why he didn't think of suggesting the deal in the first place when I ordered a small salad is totally beyond me. Many waiters have been nice enough to point out to me that there's a similar option/deal that's cheaper to save me a few bucks.)

Don't get me wrong, I use canned diced and stewed tomatoes in many dishes I make at home; it's just when you are going to have a sauce on a Chicago deep dish pizza, it's a pretty damned important component that should taste good whether dine-in, carry out or delivery. The thin crust was actually significantly better than the deep dish; I would give that a solid 3 stars but unfortunately cannot click 2.5.I'm fully aware that travel time, standing time, etc... can lead to a pizza that isn't as great of quality as if I would have sat in the Lou Malnati's and ordered a pizza, but overall taste is only going to change to a certain degree.

Then there was the crust...well it was buttery, crispy and not hard like our Saturday experience. \u00a0It all combined for a crispy, buttery wrapping around a cheesy saucey, bite of sausagey goodness. \u00a0We were full after the waitress served us both another slice and then she wrapped our pizza in aluminum foil so we could take it back on the plane with us to spread the good word on Lou Malnati's pizza. \u00a0Now I don't know if all the crusts are the \"Buttercrust\" because I didn't see any other pizzas on the menu with this description, but this \"buttercrust\" was great, crisp, buttery, great tasting and flavorful.While I am still a NY style pizza guy...thin, crisp crust, flash cooked, in a super hot oven, I am open to trying another great Deep Dish Pizza.

I cant remember his name, but was chatty, informative, and checked on us quite a few times. Kept our glasses filled, and asked questions as he told us about the menu. I think our problem was that my guest and I really wanted different pizzas, and thus, we settled on lunch sized individual 6\" pizzas. He chose the pepperoni, and I got the Lou - a white pizza with a garlic/spinach blend and mushrooms. We also started with the appetizer sampler.The sampler was a large platter of fried stuff... zucchini, mushroom, mozzarella cheese sticks, and cheddar cheese balls. The flavor was good, but it was just way too fried. Served with marinara and ranch, I found myself picking of even more of the fried coating than I usually do. I wish I would have ordered a bruschetta or garlic bread app instead. Maybe next time.I did not try the pepperoni pizza, so I will comment just on mine, the Lou. It had a good taste and mouth feel, and I liked the spinach/garlic/cheese blend. What I didnt love though, was that it did not remind of me of real deep dish pizza.

We saw several smalls and mediums come out that looked much deeper. To be fair, the server did recommend a small instead of the 2 individuals. He said you get the same amount of pizza, and its cheaper, but since we had such different topping interests, we settled for individuals.I'd like to come back again, and order more appropriately.

Within 20 minutes (after saying hellos to a bunch of other folks we ran into in the lobby) we were on our way to Lou Malnati's (which was recommended by the kind concierge at the Westin River North lobby)......And the verdict? Zachary's wins. At least for me. The pizza at Lou's was OOOOOOKAY. For someone who's used to getting tomato filled deep dish pizzas... These cheese filled ones were a bit bland...

While at the bar, we were greeted quickly by the bartender, Greg, who offered us drinks and menus. \u00a0Carol had a glass of Chardonnay and I opted for an unsweetened Iced Tea. \u00a0Both the wine and the tea were good, but the Iced Tea did not taste fresh brewed.We each ordered an individual Deep Dish Pizza with Lou's famous butter crust - I ordered the Lou and Carol the Classic Chicago. \u00a0We split a medium Malnati Salad. \u00a0Salad was very good with fresh crisp lettuce and a nice variety of toppings. \u00a0The dressing was excellent and had a sweet taste to it. \u00a0The Pizzas were phenomenal and the Butter Crust really gave them a great flavor. For Dessert, we tried the Chocolate Chip Cookie Pizza - a deep dish pan with a homemade chocolate chip cookie topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream. \u00a0Very Nice! \u00a0The only negative I can give it was that it had too much Whipped Cream on it.Atmosphere in the restaurant was OK, but I felt it was a little bright. \u00a0The walls are filled with pictures and memorabilia so you have a distraction while you wait for your food. \u00a0One of my personal pet peeves was evident here as the restaurant was a little slow to start and the servers were standing at the service station doing crossword puzzles and griping about the seating rotation of the hostesses. \u00a0There was no manager evident until we were done with our meal, and this would have been his issue to deal with.Restrooms, floors and bar surface were all kept clean. \u00a0There were areas of neglect in some of the higher areas such as vents and ceiling tiles. \u00a0Overall the restaurant was well kept.", "Date": "2012-04-04", "Author_Location": "Yorktown Heights, NY"}, {"Author": "Paul I.", "ReviewID": "sTQcJK99JZlGJgwGtWO7aA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had never had Chicago deep dish pizza before in Chicago. \u00a0I am a fan of New Haven style thin crust pizza, but I was in Chicago and had to try traditional deep dish. \u00a0We ordered the sausage pie with onions, peppers, sliced tomatoes, garlic, and spinach. \u00a0It was very good, surprisingly. \u00a0I can't say that it is actually pizza. \u00a0It is more of a casserole or lasagna type of thing. \u00a0The crust was more of a pie crust than a doughy pizza crust. \u00a0The toppings were very tasty and of high quality. \u00a0 \u00a0It did in fact take a long time for the pizza to come. \u00a0We ordered salads which broke up the meal a bit. \u00a0I liked the deep dish pizza a lot, but it is not something I could eat every week like normal pizza. \u00a0It's too heavy. \u00a0I could see it being a great meal on Christmas though (instead of a traditional Lasagna). \u00a0I would go back to Lou's if I visit Chicago again. \u00a0It's sure is a lot better than the Pizzeria Uno chain.", "Date": "2012-08-14", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Kristen P.", "ReviewID": "OO5nGjEtw7M2mxX9YdT0BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is the bad new. \u00a0There is some kind of drug in Lou's pizza because once you have it you will want to come back and miss it when you do not have it. \u00a0This is some of the best Chicago Deep Dish pizza in Chicago! \u00a0They buffalo wings are also great! \u00a0A very busy place but what is nice is that while my friends and I were waiting for our table we were able to place an order for our deep dish which was soooooooooooo delicious! \u00a0Nice looking place and our waiter was awesome! \u00a0I have been to two different Lou location and both were awesome. \u00a0You cannot be in Chicago and not try this place. \u00a0A plus is if you are alone there are personal pizza's that you can order which some pizza places do not offer. \u00a0I have been to other great pizza places but I gotta say Lou's is the best! \u00a0Definitely a Chi town must visit! \u00a0Be prepared to have heartburn after ha ha ha.", "Date": "2012-12-02", "Author_Location": "St Petersburg, FL"}, {"Author": "David R.", "ReviewID": "Q0jD7kR-WSR3umV73i0nzw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Pizza, Great Service !!! \u00a0Phone and delivery service is spot-on", "Date": "2012-12-17", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "John M.", "ReviewID": "UKfhtC7UID_4xoUcjfWqZg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best pizza in Chicago!!!!

I mean, how can you hate a city that has awesome pizza, steaks, and popcorn (Garrett). But let's jump right into why you are reading this review to begin with. When I first got here, I was searching for the best deep dish pizza I could find and I was excited. I had ordered Giordano's originally and it was solid do not get me wrong but there is nothing like a Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. I was actually very fortunate because a co worker was very familiar with the pizza in the city as he had been here a few times and after he had heard my experience with Giordano's he told me that I had to try Lou Malnati's or I would not be getting the right deep dish pizza experience. So that night I order a pepperoni, sausage, and cheese deep dish pizza.Wow. That is all I can say and even that does not justice to this pizza. This pizza has awesome crust, the toppings are super fresh, and oh man the cheese is outta control. One bite of this gooey cheese is enough to make me start drooling. The sausage is awesome because as opposed to bits of it, it's essentially a sheet allowing you to have the perfect proportion of sausage, pepperoni, cheese, and fresh tomato in each single bite that you take.

Every one has their favorite, and I personally pick Lou's! I love this pizza, it is hands down my favorite deep dish pizza EVER. These are the reasons why I love this pizza: -The buttery crust that is on the thinner side and has some cornmeal in it. The crust isn't doughy so you don't feel like you are filling up on the crust alone. -If you get the sausage, they put a nice LAYER of a sausage so you get sausage with every bite -The sauce has a nice flavor, there seems to be a slight undertone of white wine? in it. What ever it is, it is....as guy would say....money. There are actual diced tomatoes in the sauce, its not so pulverized that you forget what you are eating. -The cheese, like the crust, isn't over powering. I'm all about balance and ratio with my food and Lou's does it right. This particular location can get crowded, and you can expect to wait if you go on a weekend past 6 or 7pm. You are able to pre-order your pies before you get seated, cutting the time you wait to eat. Pizza aside: They also used to have a great and refreshing spinach salad on their menu that has recently been taken off. Not too heavy (especially right before pizza) and hits the spot with spinach, Lou's house dressing, cheddar cheese, fresh mushrooms, salami bits (better then they sound), and tomatoes.

We opted to order the Spinach Bread as my friend Brian had suggested this as being a \"must have\".Not to boast the server's diligence, but the spinach bread had a wait time of 15 minutes... \u00a0Great!Tick Tock... \u00a0Tick Tock... \u00a0Ding! \u00a0Spinach Bread!The Spinach Bread: \u00a0Two Words... \"Queso Grande\". \u00a0Don't let the name of the dish fool you. \u00a0Neither bread nor spinach are the hosts of this dish, it's the cheese! \u00a0Sure, the appetizer was coated with a \u00a0in thick piece of bread and strategically sprinkled spinach pieces (which were few and far between), but once you cut into the sucker, the mozzarella persistently flows with no end in sight. \u00a0The steam of mozzarella can engulf the entire serving plate if you allow it! \u00a0Let's focus on the taste... \u00a0Of course, anything with gluttonous amounts of cheese will taste good. \u00a0Just ask the Italians, they eat cheese straight up. \u00a0What I took from this dish was that despite the insurmountable amount of cheese used in the application, the balance in taste between all ingredients was well thought out. \u00a0Overall, despite the gluttonous amounts of cheese used, the application was highly preferred...Like clock work, Spinach Bread Down... \u00a0Here comes the Deluxe Deep Dish!Lou Malnati's Deluxe Deep Dish Pizza: \u00a0The presentation of the dish itself produced high praise and fright. \u00a0From the visual perception alone, the monstrosity that is to be my lunch overwhelmed any conscious dieting efforts. \u00a0For starters, the simple thickness of the Pizza resembled that of 5 thin crust slices stacked upon one another. \u00a0Still, despite my inherent dieting nature to turn away from such a decree, I indulged. \u00a0The taste... \u00a0Despite the burdensome corpulent nature of the Pizza, the balance (despite it's hearty portion) was exactly what was needed for such a \"casserole\" inspired application. \u00a0Digging into Lou Malnati's Deep Dish was comparable to that of eating a meatloaf with a butter crusted piece of bread on the bottle. \u00a0The overwhelming, but pleasantly, enjoyable, pizza was one in which the mightiest of eaters can only consume but so much of a good thing. \u00a0I opted to cop out @ 2 \u00a01/2 slices, my ordinary thin crust consumption would be the entire pie. \u00a0Much tasty, much preferred indeed!As if the Pizza wasn't enough... \u00a0Why not dessert?Chocolate Chip Pizza: \u00a0The individual sized dessert was coated with a bottom layer of a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. \u00a0The dish was then topped with 2 quarts of ice cream, whipped cream, and cherries. \u00a0From my first visual gaze of this dessert, I was even more astonished at the fact that Chicagoans were able to create consumable monstrosity after consumable monstrosity. \u00a0The taste did not disappoint, although I found the dessert to be rather sweet, the cooling sensation generated from the ice cream gave the buttery chocolate chip cookie the right balanced needed for such a dessert. \u00a0The whipped cream added a nice touch of lighten sweetness to both the ice cream and cookie.With all things said and done, with all items consumed to our best efforts, the bill relinquished by the restaurant was a mere $43.00! \u00a0Yeah... \u00a0This Chicago \"discounted\" pricing scheme should be implemented by NY!", "Date": "2008-06-29", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Michelle P.", "ReviewID": "UAj1M-USbhlNuucqU4VRWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could write a really long review outlining every fantastic thing about this place. \u00a0Or I could just simply say \"Its freaking awesome\". \u00a0 I only had the plain cheese, but think that was a smart move because then i could taste the melted cheese and the incredibly well seasoned but not overpowering mozerella sauce. \u00a0The buttery deep dish crust is so much better than the corn based one at Genos. \u00a0I also had the bruschetta, which was great and i loved the fact that i could drink pitchers of Goose Island's 312. \u00a0 The pizza was even fantastic the next day as an afternoon snack. \u00a0Overall, my new favorite Chicago Deep Dish pizza place.", "Date": "2008-06-28", "Author_Location": "Fairfax, VA"}, {"Author": "Shannon M.", "ReviewID": "J7nIyHjU2Wij3KU41Roe4w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My FAVORITE Chicago pizza place. \u00a0Great deep dish, but I personally love the thin crust.

I was not disappointed at all and actually pleasantly surprised by how much I liked Lou's. We ordered the famous \"Lou,\" with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced tomatoes, with the addition of sausage. The best part of the pizza was the buttermilk crust. Unlike the flaky and dense dough from Giordano's, Lou's buttermilk crust is lighter and more buttery. It is wildly addictive as I found myself wanting more crust than the rest of the pizza (usually I just like to eat the pizza and forgo the crust). I think my only complaint about this pizza is that the excess of vegetables creates a watery composition. This is due to the water loss from the spinach and the pizza becomes not quite soggy per say, but it would be getting there. But I can appreciate that the three vegetarian ingredients keeps the flavors simple and good. Between two people, we ended up ordering a large with 8 slices that feeds four people.

Greet my party at the door - if there isn't a line, don't make us wait more than one minute without being greeted 2. A server should greet our table within 3 minutes of being seated, ask for a drink order and tell us the specials of the day4. Servers must have a thorough knowledge of every item on the menu, especially for customers with common dietary restrictions (vegan, nut allergies, etc.)5. If our food is taking longer than normal, at least check in with the guests. \u00a0An explanation might not be needed - just don't ignore us. \u00a0Communication goes a LONG way in preventing unhappy guests!5. Servers MUST do at least a visual check (make direct eye contact, if not verbal contact) within 3 minutes of our entrees being served. \u00a0This is the 3 most important minutes of the entire meal! \u00a0If my food is over/undercooked, not as I requested, if I need more salad dressing, or want another glass of wine WITH my meal, etc. - NOW is the time for those requests to be handled ASAP. \u00a0MOST restaurants in Chicago fail at this basic point of service6. A great server will notice if I am getting low on iced tea/coffee/water, etc., and keeps it refilled without me having to flag them down7. A great sever will be able to \"read\" his customers, and know if they want to be entertained, or left alone and interrupted as infrequently as possible. \u00a0A visual check - the server makes their presence known in case the customer needs anything, but does not interrupt - can be highly effective.8.

I went to Lou Malnati's to try their (in)famous gluten free pizza. To make the pizza gluten free they substitute a large disk of sausage for the crust. Since hearing about it, I haven't spoken with anyone who actually tried it. I think it's one of those things that sounds interesting, but is a little more than the stomach can handle.I ordered a small (rather than personal size) with the optimistic hope that I would love it and want leftovers. With my first bite, I was surprised to find that the sausage is not dripping with grease, and actually has a distant resemblance to the consistency of a chewy crust. This is not what sausage is supposed to do. After a few more exploratory bites, I decided it was not a bad substitute -- the lack of oil/fat in the sausage is good because really fatty sausage in that quantity could do a person in. But without the flaky pizza crust to support it, the sauce and the whole pizza tasted bland. I had two slices, then called it a day. The leftovers didn't go home with me.Lou's has had this version of the gluten free pizza for a while now, and back when they started serving it there was much less known about the food chemistry of how to make a gluten-free crust, and certainly fewer suppliers of quality ingredients. Times have changed though, and several companies are now serving excellent gluten free pizza that is indistinguishable from the rest. Lou's needs to revisit this offering and bring it up to date. if you're with someone who HAS to have Lou Malnati's, the personal pizza is a viable part of a larger meal.

What I didn't enjoy so much however, was the way that Lou Malnati's layers the different components of their pizzas. The cheese is layered in slices under the sauce, and the sausage was layered similarly, evenly across the bottom of the pan. The construction not only made each bite kind of boring after two bites, but the cheese also got quite gloopy and chewy as the pie got cold. Overall the pizza was just a total gut-bomb, not something I would want to have more than once. Chicago style deep-dish really doesn't constitute pizza to me, and I still would rather write it off as some sort of casserole/quiche/savory pie.

I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt).

They don't use the button-type that I like. The ones they use are way to strong and the only flavor you taste)3) there was no sauce - maybe I didn't read the menu properly but I swear this pizza had no sauce on it. I hope they didn't think the flavorless tomatoes on top made up for it.Overall, I now have to put Lou's as the worst Chicago pizza I've ever had.

Asking my friends (2 of whom live there, and a couple of whom have visited in the last year) I was getting differing opinions.I had already tried Giordano's, wasn't too impressed. So we decided to go to Lou Malnati's. We ordered take-out because the place was PACKED!! I ordered a small deep dish with italian sausage and pepperoni. Apparently, the italian sausage is most popular, and really could see why. The size small is 9 inches, was enough to feed 3 girls, and came out to be $13.50. REALLY!? $13.50?! soo cheap!!! i was seriously shocked at how much quality and taste was in the pizza for such a price! But first, the restaurant: We took the brown line to merchandise mart and the restaurant was only a few blocks away. very convenient!! The place, as I've said, was packed! There were people outside, and as soon as we opened the door, it was hard to get in because people were waiting. \u00a0the restaurant interior is warm, brightly lit with orangey lights, tables pretty close together but not in a bad way bc it gave off a very homey feel. The employees (the one who directed me to the restroom and the one that helped me at the counter) were all very nice, easy going, and friendly. Back to the pizza: SOOOO yum!! the crust was crispy, \u00a0cheese was enough to be delicious, but not overpowering and not too much. the italian sausage!! the seriously, lined the entire pie with the italian sausage. as you can see from my picture, the entire pie is lined with a sheet of sausage so that you get a heavy dose of sausage in every bite. that was different from giordano's, whose pizza my friends and I exclaimed \"wait..wheres the sausage!!?\". The saltiness of the pepperoni was perfectly balanced against the juiciness of the fresh tomatoes that filled the top of the pie. When we opened the pie, it was juicy due to the fresh tomatoes, so be careful if you're taking it long distances. (Quick tip: we took it to the portillo's a few blocks away and ate it before we ate their hot dogs and italian beef sandwiches. Sorry portillo's, :P, we know we broke your rules, but 3 hungry girls in a big city CANNOT be expected to wait until we get to our hotel room before we dive into the food :P) all in all, my favorite meal in Chicago. best pizza I've ever tasted. juicy, fresh, crispy, savory, yummy, delicious.Lou Malnati's, can you please come to California?!", "Date": "2011-04-20", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Karen T.", "ReviewID": "J5fatMmtRayErhks4xpVBw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was so excited to run to Lou Malnati's for my 1st Chicago Pizza experience in Chicago!

When asking local friends on the \"best\" spot, they were torn between Giordano's and Lou Malnati's. Lou's won the toss, simply because it was within closer proximity. Caution: The stuffed pizza resembling a casserole or lasagna is more than a meal.If you go for the large, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes but if you go for the personal, it cuts the cooking time to more than half. I'd skip on an appetizer and wait for the dish because this is more than filling. I tried the plain cheese and the flakey buttery crust was just perfect, plus the cheese portion is modest allowing one to taste all the other fresh ingredients.

There was no need for a box because the pizza was just that good, and we scarfed it all down (politely, of course). The spinach and mushrooms tasted very fresh and the tomatoes that garnished the pizza were slightly crispy. Plenty of cheese yet it didn't feel too heavy.

From start to finish our entire experience was downright awful. When we arrived we waited next to the hostess station to be seated. After a few minutes of standing there with no one helping us, finally the hostess turned to look at us and angrily said \"do you need something?\" Obviously, we would like to be seated, thanks for being so great at your job... When we were ordering we decided to order the \"individual sized pizzas\" thinking it would be enough for a lunchtime meal....we were wrong. The 'Individual' size pizzas should be called the 'child size' pizzas, because they are enough for only a 5 year old. They do not even come served in the deep dish tray, but on a mini plate. The pizza itself was good, however, there was very little of it, and we had to wait an hour for our pizza...AN HOUR for the pizza the size of my fist. We only actually received our pizza once we flagged down another member of the waitstaff. Our waitress passed by us numerous times without asking how things were, or letting us know our order was on the way. Frankly, I think she forgot about us, because for awhile she was standing against the wall of the restaurant doing nothing. When we went to pay the hostess again acted as though we were bothering her. While the food was good, I will never come back here again.

Lou Malnati's in River North was recommended to me and my friend by absolutely everybody we met in Chicago -- and absolutely everybody we met spelled or pronounced it hilariously wrong! How we ever found it, I will never know. New Menotti's, Louis Minnetti's, Vincent Minnelli's -- you name it. And nobody we met could think of that place featured (as superb) by Anthony Bourdain on \"No Reservations\". So at Lewis MacNutty's, we had this: The \"Malnati Chicago Classic\": Lou Malnati's is legendary for its pizza in the pan, and here, sausage is the specialty of the house. Made with Lou's exclusive blend of lean sausage, some extra cheese, and vine-ripened tomato sauce on our famous Buttercrust.\u2122 It's authentic Chicago!\" \u00a0We found the sausage and trademarked Buttercrust.\u2122 delightful, but very bland and rather non-Italian tasting. So, I cannot fully recommend Sue MacNaughlty's, especially at crowded family hour when even the seats that are not seats are packed with parents and screaming children eating or waiting in hungry packs.
