Luckily, my good friend surprised me with a dinner here because he knew I'd been curious about Toro :). I'm very happy to say that we had an adventurous meal with wonderful service from the hostesses and waitress. While we waited for a table, one of the hostesses helped us select our dishes so we could get straight to ordering and eating (it was 10pm and we were pretty ravenous). Our approach was to try dishes we'd never had, which led to ordering based on animal parts...We started with the Atun Crudo, which was the least adventurous decision. The Yellowfin tuna with white soy, spicy cucumbers, citrus and avocado was a refreshing start to a very heavy meal. Although well-thought out and generous with the slices, I would order something new next time.The Corazon, which is grilled Archer Angus beef heart with romesco, reminded me of sliced roast beef. It was bland on its own, so the romesco was essential. While it was fun to try, I would try another interesting animal part in its place next time.The Foie Gras y Piquillo, consisting of seared foie gras with piquillo pepper, cider vinegar gastrique, and candied walnuts, was everything you think it would be. Upon ordering, I had 49% guilt and 51% pleasure. After that foie was in my mouth, I had 10% guilt and 90% pleasure. The dish could use a tad bigger slice of foie. I can handle the guilt.I've heard a lot about sweetbreads from all the food shows I watch, so we tried the Mollejas, which are crispy veal sweetbreads with blood orange, fermented black beans, peanuts and celery root. I had always imagined the texture of a thymus to be off-putting and somewhat like a goopy animal gland. Thankfully, I was very, very wrong. The sweetbreads were dense enough to be cut with a knife and were smooth and creamy. Wonderful stuff that I'd get again.The Jamon Blanco, made up of La Quercia lardo on grilled sourbread with jonah crab, crispy shallots and pickled green almonds, did a perf job of highlighting the crab. You'd think the cheese would be overpowering, but luckily it only added richness to the crab.The star of the dinner was the Asado de Huesos; roasted bone marrow with radish citrus salad and oxtail marmalade. I'd never had bone marrow before since it never appealed to me. After the Asado de Huesos, I'm a convert. Although the marrow was buttery and rich, the oxtail marmalade toast really tied this dish together. I doubt I'd order bone marrow on its own. Might even order 2 of these next time.The Jerez Manhattan with bourbon, sherry, cherry and black walnut bitters, and the Butterflies Revenge with rye, carpano antica, cynar, brandy, orange bitters and bergamot salt, were solid and strong. I'd say the Butterflies Revenge eked out the Manhattan by a smidge on the uniqueness factor.", "Date": "2014-07-14", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Jon H.", "ReviewID": "epVU1uhxJukPUvzuLXvrfw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had 5 people, and everybody thought it was great.

The last time I went here, it was a rainy Friday in April. The place was packed to the brim-- it took us about 45 minutes to an hour to get seated. I guess it's not that hard to be packed when your whole establishment is probably around 230 square feet. I'm probably exaggerating here, but you understand. \u00a0We waited at the bar, and I had what seemed to be the safest thing on the menu for a celiac. I don't remember what it was, but I ordered three more of them later on and was very satisfied. Maybe that's why the bill didn't shock me as much as it should have? After we were finally seated, the waitress asked us if any of us had food allergies. I quickly responded that I couldn't eat gluten, and she offered to bring out the gluten-sensitive menu (yes, this did happen!). She was very quick to let me know that it wasn't a dedicated kitchen and that I might have to be careful if it was a \"serious food allergy.\" Technicalities aside (celiac disease is not an allergy), I took what she said to heart and still ordered food. I ordered the corn on the cob (my go-to dish at any barbecue, if you're thinking of inviting me over for one), smoked duck drumette, and an empanada. The corn on the cob was so delicious-- it was very rich. That alone could probably have satisfied me that night. This year has been my year to explore ducks-- the meat, the eggs, just everything about ducks. Not disappointing, but it's still not chicken. The drumette didn't taste like either turkey or chicken; it tasted...like duck, I guess. In spite of my dislike for its duck aftertaste, I continued eating it, because I was paying for it. (That's how I roll.) And the empanadas? I know what you're thinking: empanadas are not gluten free. \u00a0Be not fooled, my fellow Yelpers; these empanadas were definitely gluten-free, and the dough had the cornmeal after-taste to prove it. The waitress continued to tell me that they were made on a surface with products that contained gluten, but I had been dying to have an empanada for so long, that I just did not care. I'm still looking for the perfect gluten-free chicken empanada. If you think you've found it, let me know! 5 stars for the drinks, an \"okay\" for the experience overall, and a 4 from my friends who have no dietary restrictions.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Cambridge, MA"}, {"Author": "Irene H.", "ReviewID": "8_rgLv5RPdHYMvxHSWXW7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 4 years, I have finally revisited Toro and can still say that their uni bocadillo and grilled corn is the best I've had!While there was a wait, the kind bartenders asked some folks to move to free up two seats at the bar (around Saturday night 6pm for dinner).

With an average wait time of 1.5 hours, you don't need me to tell you how good and popular this place is. Alas, I will try to make my case:Tapas dishes:Mushroom paella: This was a special on the day we came in and I have to say we got super lucky was cause it was damn delicious. We have a running joke with one of our roommmates about mushrooms ever since the first time she tried to order shiitake (pronouncing it shit-take) so we had to order this when we found out it was a special of the night. They offer their paella dishes in a full and half size which is super nice because sometimes you just want to try a little without overdosing on the carbs. We ordered the half size and it was perfect for our table of 4. The flavor was outstanding. One of our other roommates doesn't care for mushrooms either but even she enjoyed it. Nice crispy edges that make you scrape every little grain off that pan.Gambas Al Ajillo: Garlic shrimp. Amazing. The plate came with 5 shrimp and we were all fighting over the last one. They use saffron in the dish which just made it for me. Maiz Asado Con Alioli Y Queso Cotija: The famous corn. I know corn doesn't sound too special but believe me when I say that this is the best thing to order here. I've had my fair share of mexican/spanish variations of corn dishes but this one is by far the best I've ever had. The aioli, the lime, the cotija cheese, everything is perfect. It's super creamy with a hint of buttery flavor and the corn is grilled so nicely that it almost tastes like popcorn (A super fancy delicious gourmet popcorn). It was so good we ordered 2 orders. Foie Gras:Served with 3 tiny little bite sized pieces, it was melt in your mouth delicious. I've never really been big on foie gras but this made me a believer. It was rich and slightly creamy. Patatas Bravas: Prepared perfectly with the perfect aioli/red sauce pairing. The potatoes weren't too crispy and weren't too soft. Very savory solid comfort food. Crispy pork belly: This was the hardest to split between 4 people. Nonetheless it was great. The \"kimchi\" they served with it was not conventional Korean kimchi but it was still good. Instead of cabbage it had more radish/daikon. Churros:Everyone's favorite dessert. I have to say after an extraordinary meal, this was my least favorite thing we ate all night. I wished the churro pieces were hot and fresh rather than the room temperature they were served at. Maybe we were too full or maybe our particular dessert was just a little off from their normal game but I would probably skip this next time and order an extra tapas plate if I'm still hungry. Side note: keep replenishing your bread supply cause you'll want to soak up every last piece of sauce on every dish you finish. Also a little bit about the wait time. We came in right around the opening at 5:00 on a Tuesday. They don't start seating until 5:30 and until all of your party is present so we ended up waiting a little while at the bar until the rest of the people got in. It filled up pretty quickly but even an hour later around 6:00 we were able to get seated right away.

Toro is located in Boston's South End neighborhood and is arguably one of the hottest restaurants in town. We were shocked when we arrived at almost 2pm on a Friday how crowded it was. Since the restaurant doesn't take reservations there is a chance you may have to wait upwards of two hours for a table. Trust me, it's worth it.Luckily they have great cocktails to sip on while you wait and if any seats open up at the bar grab them because you can order from the whole menu while sitting there. We lucked out and snagged two seats at the bar within 5 minutes of walking in the door, otherwise we would have been waiting at least and hour.As we looked over the menu we decided to treat ourselves to some day time cocktails.My roommate got the Chupacabra made with tequila, lime, and spicy mango simple syrup. I like spicy foods and drinks but this one was really SPICY! Order with caution because your mouth will be on fire throughout the meal. My cocktail choice was the Gypsy made with gin, elderflower, yellow chartreuse and lime. I liked how light and refreshing it was. I could definitely sip down a few of these in one sitting but restrained myself to just one as it was a Friday afternoon.Toro's menu is broken down into Pinchos, Tapas and Calientes as well as Bocadillos Y Ensaladas and Paella's.For our first Pincho (small snack) we chose a Pan con Tomate which is a toasted bread with tomato, garlic, Spanish olive oil and sea salt. It was like eating a really fresh bruschetta.Our second Pincho was the Datiles con Jamon. These Medjool dates filled with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese are one of my favorite items on the menu. Oh, they are wrapped in Jamon Serrano. Anything wrapped in bacon or ham is a win in my book!Now for the Tapas. Another favorite of mine is the Pato con Membrillo, or the Smoked duck drumettes with quince glaze. These sticky and sweet drumettes are finger-licking good and have a ton of meat on them.The Maiz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija is a house special. I get this dish EVERY time I go to Toro and if you look around you will find and order at every table. This grilled corn with alioli, lime, espelette pepper and aged cotija cheese is a little taste of heaven. There are many restaurants that try to recreate this dish but none will ever be as good as this. EVER.A special dish on the menu was the Mejillones otherwise known as mussels with chorizo and basque cider. I loved how big the mussels were and the broth was flavorful with just the right amount of spice from the chorizo. Make sure to get extra bread to sop up the additional broth.Another special on the menu was the Empanada de Carne de Res y Patatas. This spicy curry beef and potato empanada was served with a cucumber, yogurt and clianto sauce. I am not a huge curry fan but I liked this dish because the curry was very faint. The dish is slighly spicy but if you dip it in the yogurt sauce it has a nice cooling effect.Our last tapa dish was another menu special and a little on the adventurous side for me. The Pate de Cerdo, or bacon wrapped rabbit and pork pate with basque cider and rhubarb mostarda, had a lot of flavor and I loved the rhubarb and mustard.You can't go to Toro and not get the Churros con Chocolate for dessert. These are some of the best churros I have had - nice and crispy on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside and served warm. You get a nice portion of chocolate on the side so you can dip each and every last bite!If you live in Boston and haven't been to Toro yet, or are just visting make sure to get in there ASAP.

The hostess was friendly, the waiter was prompt and knowledgable about the wine menu, and the food came out at well-spaced intervals.The food was amazing - Toro serves Spanish tapas, but with Asian influences that made for some really unique flavor combinations. When my friend suggested the maiz asado, I was hesitant, but I absolutely loved the dish. The corn was sweet and slightly charred, slathered in creamy alioli and cheese, and the lime juice added the perfect tangy kick. The sweetbreads were the most interesting dish we ordered - the salty fermented bean curd contrasted well with the savory-sweet citrus sauce, showcasing an unexpectedly Asian flavor. The asado de huesos was the highlight of the meal. The presentation was impressive, the bone marrow was rich and tasted slightly Sichuanese, and the radish citrus salad made the perfect refreshing accompaniment. It was so good, we literally ate in silence. We also ordered the ensalada atun, a light salad that, while well-prepared, was not particularly memorable.Toro perfectly combines relaxed but classy atmosphere with truly inspired dishes, making it perfect for anything from a casual (albeit expensive) meal to a special occasion.

They have one entree at breakfast that seems to please most men because it looks like ultimate nachos with way fancier ingredients: crispy tortillas tossed with Mexican style braised chicken, cotija cheese (same stuff on the corn), avocado and creme fraiche. The basic eggs, toast (amazing), and potatoes is good. But it's basic, ya know? I added the grilled avocado to mine and was pleasantly surprised. Even after asking the waitress a second time where the avocado was, she just exclaimed that it took longer than everything else. I get that, but I literally waited so long that my eggs were cold. Avocado and eggs is amazing, but best when both are warm. Toro's the kind of place that can typically get away with things coming out as they're ready. But this one was a bit of a fail. Not sure if they thought I was just going to spoon avocado in my mouth or not? Oh - we also ordered the delicious dates stuffed with almonds and cheese. They're a must-order in my book, but I wish the waitress gave us a heads up on their temperature. Literally burned all of our tongues. It's my fault too because I was raving about them to first timers, and since they're served on a toothpick you just pick it up and toss it in your mouth...well, now I know to do so with caution. Because we're all still nursing burnt tongues! So moral of my adventure is: if you like Toro's dinner menu, you're in luck for brunch because most of it's available.

She started to say \"actually, I just have a question\" when he immediately put his hand in her face, rolled his eyes, and snarked \"I said just a minute\".

But this time, we transferred all 10 of our group's drinks to the table. I was not about to tip this guy for being such a dick. This first interaction left a REALLY sour taste in my mouth, and I hoped that the rest of the staff wasn't as rude as Sam.Lucky for us, we were seated not too long after. Feeling a little on the adventurous (and hungry) side, we went with the infamous corn, sweet breads, spanish tuna belly, garlic shrimp, cow tongue, bone marrow, and paella.

We arrived at around 6-7pm on a Thursday and were lucky to be able to obtain a table for two without any wait or problem. \u00a0On another occasion, we came on a rainy Sunday night and the place was packed; they told us at that time, the wait for two people would have been an hour! \u00a0Insanity!The restaurant itself is very dimly lit with small candles adorning each table. \u00a0The eating area is also very tight - I accidentally grabbed our neighbor's handbag by accident mid meal thinking it was my own! \u00a0Because of close quarters its easy to bump elbows and unintentionally eaves drop into other people's conversation.We decided to order:Paella Valenciana ($20) \u00a0- Shrimp, muscles, clams, chorizo, and chicken over Calasparra riceSomething similar to the Suquet de Mariscos ($16) - Had a tomato stew base with lobster, clams, muscles and stopped with a white mystery foamFilete a la Plancha ($15) - Hanger steak with cabrales butter and red onion with clams, lobster and muscles topped with a white mystery foamMaiz Asado con Aioli y Queso Cotija ($8) - House special grilled corn with lime, espelette pepper and aged cheese\\The paella takes about 30 minutes to prepare and we received the other tapas first. \u00a0They gave us an accompaniment of bread to eat with our tapas. \u00a0The hanger steak was flavored well and the red onion marmalade had a sweet, pickled taste that surprisingly went well all together. \u00a0The steak itself was of course, small in portion and came in about 8-10 slices.Then we received the stew. \u00a0Very delicious and the bread we had was great for soaking up the sauciness of the dish. \u00a0Very little lobster was noted, however in this tapa.The half sized portion of paella was bigger than what I was expecting. \u00a0There was a good amount of seafood and meats and, like everything else we had, it was very flavorful. \u00a0I think I would have preferred the rice to be a bit less saucy, though we still finished each and every bit of it. \u00a0Then came the corn. I've heard amazing things and have seen endless pictures about this Godly corn and I'm happy I finally got to try it. \u00a0The plate came with 4 half pieces of corn smothered in aioli and coated generously with the cotija cheese. \u00a0It almost felt sinful to take a bite into one of these bad boys - decadent and just so darn good. My only complaint is that I wish there were more of it in an orderYes, it was pricey, and yes the portions of food are small. \u00a0But after reading a ton of helpful Yelp reviews, it was exactly what we had expected. \u00a0We left feeling content with the meal and our bellies full.", "Date": "2013-12-01", "Author_Location": "Jamaica Plain, MA"}, {"Author": "Chad M.", "ReviewID": "odKguZYRE34mS7LVkq08PQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic meal. \u00a0First time at Toro last night.

We also appreciated the straw that it came with so to avoid developing the not-so-attractive red wine mouth.- Perro Picante (gin, grapefruit, spicy pepper w/ salt & chili pepper lined rim)A good balance between spicy and sweet. Just be careful of the chili pepper, which can leave a tingling sensation on the lips. Ooh la la.- Gypsy (gin, chartreuse, st. germain, lime)Refreshing without being too citrusy.PINCHOS & TAPAS- Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes w/ alioli & spicy tomato sauce)Piping hot and fried to crispy perfection. Though I love alioli, I only wish there were some ground up herbs mixed in as it seemed a little plain.- Ma\u00edz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija (grilled corn w/ alioli, lime, espelette pepper, and aged cheese)A house specialty and with good reason. Warning: Bring floss / Maybe skip if this is a first date and you want to avoid any awkward messiness.- Pato con Membrillo (smoked duck drumettes w/ quince glaze)A little overcooked but the sweet glaze was delicious.- Filete a la Plancha (hanger steak w/ cabrales butter & red onion marmalade)b.'s and my favorite of the night. We ordered it medium rare (which it was) and the steak was so tender and well-seasoned. MMM, GET THIS.- Pan con Tomate (toasted bread w/ tomato, garlic, Spanish olive oil, & sea salt)An even spread of toppings, which were well-balanced in flavor, and most importantly, the bread stayed toasty.- Esp\u00e1rragos a la Plancha (grilled asparagus)Nicely grilled and tender.DESSERT- Churros & ChocolateCan't find any churros that are the same as the ones I had in Spain but since this is the only dessert option here, get it. I'm always tempted to drink the leftover chocolate like a shot but I don't because I'm a lay-dee.Overall, a much more memorable experience than my first time here, which was a while back.

Despite reading numerous complaints about the notorious line at Toro, I decided to give it a shot. I arrived around 12:30, and faced with a 25-minute wait, wandered hopelessly through the South End, moping my way into an adorable cafe for coffee and petting beautiful dogs on the sidewalk. My experience leads me to believe that not only can you survive the wait, but that you can thrive during it.Once seated, I was actually taken aback by the interior... exposed ceilings, wooden wine cabinets, chalkboard menus, and a hanging bull's head made from something other than actual bull. It was shockingly hip. At a cozy table beside the distressed brick wall, I decided to wake myself up with some yellowfin tuna crudo topped with spicy cucumbers, avocado, and yuzu. \"Buttery\" best describes this fish, which contained no noticeable amounts of butter, if any. I might not start breakfast off with it next time, but I'd certainly order it somewhere in the lineup.Next on the agenda was the legendary grilled corn with aoli, lime, and aged cheese. Was it the best thing to order on a first date? Probably not. Would I do it any differently the next time? Absofreakinglutely not. This was creamy, tangy, salty, sweet, crunchy and sloppy perfection on the cob. If an establishment is legendary for something, and that something is CORN, you best be getting it, because that's one hell of a feat. Pro tip: bring floss.Moving on to the main event, my date and I shared the soft scrambled eggs, crispy potatoes, sourdough toast, and mushrooms. We added a side of grilled avocado, which ended up being the standout component of the meal. The dish itself was high quality, but fairly basic... it definitely needed the avocado to reach drool-worthy standards.This whole time, an exceptionally cool waitress had been helping us out. Upon informing her of her exceptionally cool status, she cleared our plates and brought us complimentary digestifs. We walked out into the frigid, terrible weather feeling like a million euro, and promptly made note to give Toro a visit for dinner. Inspired, high quality tapas, a server so excellent I wanted to give them my phone number, and an interior reminiscent of a bar in Portland, conveniently located on prime property in the South End?

Their second shot at the Picadilla de Cerdo was a remake of my first order. (not joke same food). They had mushed up burned pieces from my first order to reshape the hash and recooked it.

Don't overlook the cocktail list, either - well balanced and creative drinks to start while you choose your tapas to order. First off, the corn? It's good, but really it's a vehicle for cojita and aioli. Once was enough for me. Sleeper dishes include the Catalan eggplant, smoked with sherry vinegar, the smoked duck drumettes with quince, crispy sweetbreads with blood orange and fermented black beans, and the perfectly fried empanadas stuffed with chicken and potatoes. A half order of paella is the perfect amount to split between two, sizzling in a cast iron pan for the perfect crusty socarrat to scrape up with table bread.

It was three home runs in a row - the only critical comment on the paella - it was a bit too salty! \u00a0It would had also been great if the server had brought out the beef tongue first, rather than bringing it out with the paella as it was difficult to eat both quickly enough before they got cold.Afterwards, we asked another waiter if we could speak with the exec chef or owner as we were interested in learning more about the restaurant. \u00a0Though neither were around, we were introduced to Michael, who was cooking in the kitchen. \u00a0He was very patient and open to speaking with us and sharing us his thoughts.

I've been here for dinner 4 times, and it never gets old. # Food- Based on the size of the tapas, ideal number of people is ~3-4 if a dish is meant to be shared with everyone in the party. Favorite dishes are:- Paella Valenciana (Toro's seafood paella is delicious. I prefer it to Estragon's. A half dish was adequate for three people, and a whole dish was slightly too much for four)- Patatas Bravas (hot delicious fried potatoes with aioli & ketchup-like sauce)- Maiz Asado etc. (Corn slathered in warm, cheesy, salty deliciousness. I joke with my friends that I would eat garbage if it were covered with this sauce.)- Uni Bocadillo (Sea urchin sandwiched between warm and crispy panini-esque bread. Delicious, but its smaller size makes it hard to share with more than two people)- The free bread (Make sure to request for olive oil to enjoy with the complimentary endless bread. My friends and I can never get enough of the bread & oil; we often joke that it is our favorite dish!)# Price- Like dim sum, tapas are better enjoyed with more people. If split amongst enough people (~3-4) the bill is comparable to a one-entree meal in a nicer South End restaurant.# Atmosphere - Very cozy (read: sometimes cramped), very hipster, very toasty.# Wait - They don't take reservations, and Toro always has a long wait (think at least 45 minutes during peak dinner hours). To make a point, the only times where I've eaten here without waiting are when I come right at opening time (~5 to 5:30), or on the evening of a Snowpocalypse (That's right!

The place is tiny and, while it has bar seating as well as outdoor seating, it's just not enough. It needs to be much bigger for its popularity. But, it is what it is. Went in and waited about 15 minutes to even get a seat at the bar. I didn't get a drink until then either if that tells you how crowded it was. I eventually did get a seat and squeezed into the miniscule space afforded me. It was super uncomfortable, but I was excited about the food so...I love tapas bars. They have to be one of my favorite ways to eat. I love small plates I can mix and match that don't fill me up and allow me to try different things. This place does this amazingly. The menu, at least, is extensive for this kind of thing. I started off with the tortilla espanola, which is misleading, there is no tortilla in this. It confused me and I had to look at the ingredients of potato, onion and egg with alioli again. It was dense and tasted almost like a potato casserole. The flavors were bland, but the alioli really was a great addition and helped liven it up. It really was surprisingly delicious. Second was the ventresca. It was spanish tuna belly with tomato tapenade and celery leaves. The celery leaves were just pretty, they added no flavor. This sat on a piece of toasted bread and was probably the least fishy thing I've ever tasted in dish made primarily of fish. It was really mild, but flavorful. The tastes here sort of built up until I got to the finale, for me anyway. I had the gambas al ajillo. This was griddled garlic shrimp with cascabel chilies. Those chilies were the highlight of my whole day. They're very thin and wispy, they seem to be a distraction at first, until it hits your mouth. You cannot believe the flavor of those chilies. I'm definitely going to be cooking with those. The only downside for me was that the huge shrimp were delivered tail-on. There is just no delicate way to get those things off. I dislike it very much. But, these shrimp were unforgettable. Do try, you won't be disappointed.I had churros for dessert, their only dessert actually, and they were standard churros dipped in standard dark chocolate, but were just what I needed. Service here is spectacular. The food came out quickly, I got drinks pretty fast once I sat down, and everyone was friendly. Really enjoyed the personalities here.

This dish could be improved.Coles de Bruselas a la Plancha (Brussel Sprouts) - I felt like ordering some veggies and these were very good.

Very tasty... JUST GET IT! Panza de Cerdo (Pork Belly) - very nicely cooked. I only like the lean meat part of pork belly since I just don't like the texture of the fat parts... But still good.Paella Valenciana (half) - Ahhh what can i say about this dish... The seafood was good. The rice had all the seafood flavors infused in it. the portion size was just right for two after all our other tapas. It was so deliciousFor dessert we got the churro with chocolate dipping sauce. I was SO STUFFED but this was so delicious. I actually don't like chocolate too much and I don't like anything too sweet. The chocolate wasn't too sweet at all and slightly bitter. This was actually a very nice combo and I ate it ALL. MmmmmOur server was very attentive all night and everyone in the restaurant moved with intent and speed.

A Barcelona-style tapas restaurant \u00a0featuring locally sourced ingredients in the South End, Toro has been met with critical acclaim, and a large fan-base.I have had Toro on my go-to list for a while now, but with no reservations being accepted, and three-hour waits being known on the weekends for dinner, I thought I would never find the time. One day after work I ran over to be there for their 5pm opening, figuring I would be seated immediately and guaranteed a spot! I was met with about 30 other people that had the exact same idea. Shocked, I added my name to the list, and sat at the bar while waiting for a table. I enjoyed a cocktail (the Briarpatch made with housemade raspberry vodka, rhubarb and lime), which was a bit sweet for me (but I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to sugary cocktails). A few minutes later we were seated at a tall table with stools, and by the time we were seated almost all of the tables had already been spoken for. I was amazed, and even more excited for the food with all of this popularity. We started with the tortilla espanola, an egg, potato & onion omlet with aioli. This was my favorite dish of the entire night, and I couldn't stop eating it. I may have eaten more than my fair share of this dish, and I'm not really sorry about it, because it was so worth it. Next was the dish I thought would be the healthiest and lightest dish of the night, the gambas al ajillo: griddled garlic shrimp with cascabal chilies. I wasn't expecting a thick sauce nor a heap of saffron, and was looking forward to a punch of garlic, but was so sad when these didn't work out. I couldn't taste any garlic, nor any chilies, but rather just tasted an overpowering saffron. Our next dish was the empanada de pollo y patatas: housemade chicken and potato empanada with tomatillo salsa and aioli. This dish was unmemorable for me, but my friends ranked it as one of their favorites for the meal. Half of the table, myself included (obviously), shared the asado de huesos: roasted bone marrow with radish citrus salad and oxtail marmalade. This was my friend's first time experiencing bone marrow, which he concluded tastes like \"butter, but on crack\". Valid comparison. This dish ended up being my second favorite of the night, but mostly because of the perfect oxtail marmalade, which was just sinfully delicious. Our second to last course was the costilla de buey: kabayaki glazed short ribs with chilled farro, cucumbers, radish and hazelnuts. While ordering, this was the one dish I was most excited for, but sadly it was not my favorite. Although the meat was perfectly prepared and tasted like soft beef stew in each bite, the glaze overpowered the cucumber, radish, and hazelnut taste, and we were left with only a pinch of a hit of salt as a finishing taste. Our final dish were the famous house special maiz asado con aioli y queso cotija: grilled corn with aioli, lime, espelette pepper and aged cheese. Dining with a Texan, he did not seem fazed by the layers of heaviness propped on this special. On the other hand, the Northeasterns were quite intimidated, used to our steamed fresh corn with a sprinkling of salt and a light slather of butter, this was quite different. With the charred bits tasting of popcorn, the taste was there, but this was the heaviest vegetable I've ever eaten. Also, this was the ugliest dish to eat, as we were left wiping slathered aioli off our faces, not so cute.  Although full at this point, we asked to just see the desserts, but the menu is verbal and consists of cheese or CHURROS. Obviously we had to say yes to churros...I mean, really, who says no to churros? Doused in cinnamon-sugar and served with a thick chocolate sauce, this dessert was just the heavy cherry on top of the heavy dinner we had just ingested. The choice to get churros was definitely our fault, and I take responsibility for that fault. As we rolled our way out of the restaurant, we compared dishes. Some preferred the empanadas, we all agreed on the tortilla espanola, and we disagreed on the corn. In the end, I was a bit let down, and so torn. I had such high expectations, and there were definitely some shining dishes (oxtail marmalade, yes please), but we all left so uncomfortable after eating such heavy dishes (with so many including aioli), that I'm not sure if I will return. If I do go back, I will definitely be ordering more off of the left side of the menu, the smaller bites, and the cold dishes, to attempt to try some lighter dishes they offer.A great piece of information is the fact that they serve the entire dinner menu on their lunch menu as well, so if you're in the area, stop in for your chance of a less-crowded spot for a lunch!", "Date": "2013-06-04", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Greg P.", "ReviewID": "FmlGCr3_Tq5x11GpbJ4BKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Believe the hype!I have been to Toro at least 5 times. \u00a0It's always 5 stars. \u00a0The restaurant is located in the South End. \u00a0Parking can be difficult as they do not always have valet. \u00a0Also they do not take reservations. \u00a0If you arrive early enough, it is not too bad a wait. \u00a0They have a nice but crowded bar to help pass the wait. \u00a0After you get through these hurdles, the food is stunning.Offering a mix of cold and hot tapas, the variety and attention to flavor will keep you ordering more and more. \u00a0Always hold onto at least one menu because you will want to keep ordering. \u00a0Top dishes include the corn with melted sweet cheese, the bone marrow, the duck legs, and of course the paella. \u00a0Definitely, save room for the paella. \u00a0It's perfect for a table of 2-4. \u00a0Toro is definitely to go-to place for high-end tapas and is absolutely fit for foodies.I am of Spanish descent and have had tapas in Madrid and Bilbao. \u00a0The tapas at Toro are terrific and quite authentic.The sangria is excellent and a nice way to accompany the meal. \u00a0They have terrific wines as well.It is worth noting that you get excellent value for your money at Toro. \u00a0Portions are good sized and your will leave comfortably full!Overall, it's absolutely worth the wait!", "Date": "2013-08-18", "Author_Location": "Brookline, MA"}, {"Author": "Ziyan C.", "ReviewID": "CmusdIESt10a4vy9zu6hxA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had a really nice catch-up dinner here with an old friend.

As with my first visit, I ordered the pork belly, beef tongue, crack on a cob (by far the best dish) every visit. Those are your safe bets. Some other items that we ordered, listed in order of tastiness:Costilla de Buey: They have two variations of this dish it seems, a CHEEKS and a SHORT RIBS version. Tonight as had the beef cheeks and they were very good, tender as usual and the glaze added just enough sweetness and taste to it. This item is to be added to my list of things to be ordered every visit.Pato con membrillo: little duck drumsticks with some glazed sauce. The meat was tender, the glaze sauce complemented the meat very well.Navajas a la plancha: Razor clams. It's the first time I've ever had it and it tasted fine but it was nothing spectacular, probably wouldn't order it next time.Paella Valenciana: Basically a paella dish that had mussels, clams, shrimp, chicken, and rice. Meh. Several clams and mussels weren't cooked all the way, the rice itself was overly salty, we couldn't finish it as a result.I have never had an issue with parking on the streets on Washington Street, so that's a pretty safe bet.

I just guess that after having heard so much about it, and being the last one to go there, makes me less impressed by the restaurant. I wasn't sure if I was expecting a totally traditional Spanish restaurant or not. I will evaluate the dishes I had one by one- Escalivada: pretty different to the kind of escalivada we have in Catalu\u00f1a, but still, it was really tasty. Instead of having all the ingredients separated, it was a mix of the pepers, eggplants, onions... It tasted great with the bread. However, I would say, the bread wasn't that good. I appreciate (and it is much more Spanish) to have bread with a harder texture.- Ventresca de at\u00fan: pretty small pincho for the price. However the ventresca tasted really good with the olive oil. Besides the olive oil I would get rid of the other \"tomato based\" sauce between the tuna and the bread.- Picadillo de cerdo: I was a little disapointed with the pork hash and also felt like the fried potatos were bland.- Filete a la plancha: We didn't order the dish, the couple seating next to us did, and unfortunately for them there was a problem with the orders and we got it. I wasn't sure if we had ordered it, but when they put food in front of me, I eat it. I think the service wasn't that good in here (we weren't charged for it at the end). I thought it was great- Asado de huesos: Probably my favorite. The bone marrow was AMAZING! The beef sticks that came with it were tasty too.To drink, we had a big bottle of Estrella Damm (750ml), first time I had their version \"Inedit\" (I don't know if it is marketed with a different name in Spain).

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is a long wait for the table. Toro doesn't take reservations, so you'll probably have to wait for over an hour to get a table for two and I'd imagine even longer for a large party. But trust me - the food is worth waiting for! We had beef short rib, crispy pork belly, patatas bravas (my staple at any tapas place), dates wrapped in jamon, smoked duck, smoked eggplant and a bean stew with egg and chorizo.

I would recommend any seasonal specialty - that first trip was in the summer, and the (knowledgeable, friendly) bartender made a gin and tonic with muddled mint and strawberry that could not have been any more perfect given the weather outside. Also - if you aren't sure what you want to drink, tell the bartender what liquor(s)/taste(s) you enjoy in and he/she will be sure to come up with something delicious.It can be expensive - as many Tapas spots can be - as you'll need to get quite a few dishes to create a full meal.

Especially when that decadence is solely related to a meal. Does drinking sherry poured through a bone after one has eaten most of the marrow count? I think it does. I arrived at Toro at 4:30, directly from the Institute of Contemporary Art. The kitchen doesn't open until 5:30 but I was ready for one of the beautiful cocktails on Toro's list. A new bartender was being trained and I can see she'll do well here -- polite, friendly, knowledgeable and a huge fan of the food. She made me Toro's take on the Manhattan with dry & sweet sherry and walnut bitters. It was perfect. By 5:30, the smells of the kitchen were making me want nothing but food...okay, not quite. I requested that Sam, the more senior bar tender pair a sherry with my first plate of Boquerones, which are marinated white anchovies and one of my most favorite things in the world. He served me a Manzanilla (dry, white) that was a lovely choice, I was still sipping away when my shaved beef heart arrived. I know that most Americans aren't used to the rich flavors of things like heart, but they should be. Especially when it is prepared at Toro. My second two choices were the ones I was really excited about: A Catalan seafood stew, which arrived with a frothy topping of milk foam, and the bone marrow, amazingly and deliciously pared with a citrus & radish salad. Both of these dishes were paired with a deep, delicious Spanish red wine similar to a tempranillo. It had some lovely fruit and no small amount of heft but was quite dry. The seafood stew was so rich in flavor and substance that I was in complete heaven down to the last bite, which I used my bread to ensure I had every last drop. The bone marrow was gorgeous and I absolutely Loved the way the citrus (orange slices) and radish cut the fat with a sparkling brightness. Noting my relish, Sam suggested a small amount of Amontillado sherry (deeper, heavier, and a tiny bit sweeter) to pour down through the shaft of the bone. In the dim candlelight, I could just see the way the fat droplets pooled on top of the sherry as I tilted the bone into my mouth. What an exquisite moment! I followed this with a full glass of the sherry as a sort of magical cap to my evening of gastronomic wizardry. I hadn't realized at the outset, by the way, that the same chef is responsible for both Toro and Chio, two amazing restaurants. It was a Wednesday night. The place was full.

Sorry for the long review.....I was really excited to come here after seeing so many raving reviews about the grilled corn. After coming back from NY and having Cafe Habana's grilled corn, I was determined to keep that sweet yet spicy taste of elotes \u00a0(Spanish for grilled corn) in my mouth.First impressions:I came here with 2 other girlfriends around 6:45PM on a Tuesday night and holy crap was it already busy. The place is so small that people were standing up right next to each other, trying to avoid waiting outside in the cold. The hostess told us it was going to be about a 30-45 min wait and it ended up being around a solid hour. However, the hostess Whitney, was totally awesome about it and she kept apologizing for the wait and told us when we were about to get seated. Also, the music didn't fit the atmosphere of the restaurant. They were playing hip-hop music (although I LOVE hip-hop music) which didn't seem to go well with the vibe of the placeFinally, we were seated in the middle of the long communal table btwn 2 other parties of 2. It was extremely loud inside and I could barely hear myself speak, let alone hear my conversation with my gfs.I'm a total foodie and I love eating out. Originally from Los Angeles, I've had my share of really GOOD Spanish food. Here's my breakdown of what we ordered and my opinions of it:1. Red wine Sangria (Pitcher which pours about a glass and a half for 3 people in a short glass) - The sangria was good. Just like any other red wine sangria I've tasted.2. Grilled corn of course! (everyone on Yelp was raving about it) - This was my number one disappointment. I came here just for this and it doesnt even compare to the grilled corn from Cafe Habana in NY or even the grilled corn that you can buy in the streets of LA. The grilled corn from Toro is bathed in aioli. There's BARELY any chili powder and the cheese they use is just some regular shredded cheese, not the cotija cheese. I felt like i was eating corn that was drenched with aioli sauce. IF you looooove aioli, then this is the place for you. BUT this is nothing compared to others that I've tasted.3. Anna's (chicken and potato) empanadas - I didn't like this dish at all. First off, I couldn't taste, or even find the pieces of chicken. I felt like it was more of a croquette than an empanada. It had a weird taste to me. 4. Patatas bravas - this was pretty much the only decent dish I had the whole night.5. Navajas a la Plancha (seared razor clams) - I didn't personally try this but my girlfriend said it was really good.OVERALL. I was NOT impressed. Too crowded, too overpriced, mediocre food.

Ma\u00edz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija - Jesus Hong Christ, foodgasm on a cob. Seriously. Corn + creamy cheese sauce. God bless the Spanish-speaking people.Garbanzos con Chorizo - The sauce, beautifully paired with chick peas, is so incredibly savory, like a stew you ladle from a pot suspended over a roaring fire.

After agonizing over the list for hours (okay, not really), I settled on The Gypsy, a gorgeous, smooth, lemony cocktail that went down as easily as a hooker at a frat party. Also tried my friend's Cava Cocktail and it was pretty tasty. For dessert, a few of us got glasses of port, and I, being the fearless adventurer, got the Barbadillo Fino, which is described as tasting of almonds and oysters. Yeah, oysters. It was pretty awesome. Smelled stronger than it actually was...psyche!Last but not least, though we sat outside, service NEVER lacked and was attentive, friendly and punctual throughout.

The two glasses recommended went well with our tapas.Food is overall worth the price and spot-on for tapas. The house specialty corn was fantastic-buttery, grilled, and just the right amount of salt and cheese. Braised short ribs were sweet and tangy, and the Spanish tortilla was light and fluffy. We also ordered patatas bravas, a small bite of artichoke, sweet Maine shrimp, and a salad, all of which were quite good. Desserts were creme catalana (a creme brulee with more interesting flavor) a foam version of the same, and churros with chocolate.

Above average tapas (not great), very friendly staff, but not worth the wait at all.They don't take reservations, which means that you should expect a *very* long wait at peak times. We waited 2.5 hours on a Friday night, for the promise of amazing food and the best tapas we would have had in recent memory. While the staff was apologetic for the wait (they must have to apologize a lot), it was downright excessive. There is very little that I would wait that long for, and unfortunately the food at Toro is just not one of those things. After standing outside for most of the night, there was no way the food could possibly live up to the expectations. And it didn't. Not even the corn. That's right, not even the corn.Now don't get me wrong, the corn was great, but balanced with everything else, it wasn't enough to put me over the top and get me back to Toro anytime soon. The rest of the food was solid, but not as good as I was expecting. Maybe Toro was just the victim of over heightened expectations, but with the exception of the odd dish here and there, I recall having plates of close quality at Dali, Tasca, and Tapeo with less fanfare and certainly less time spent staring at other people eating before I got a chance to sit down.The other thing that bothered me about Toro was the number of self-important south-end wanna-be hipster-yuppie types that were sucking down PBRs like they had just discovered the anecdote. I mean, are we still doing this? The ironic-cool thing with the PBR? Really? I thought this was replaced with the equally repulsive trend of wearing brightly-colored wayfarer sunglasses 24/7 and pretending it was like, totally normal and stuff. PBR is a fine beer for a backyard BBQ when you just want a real cold-one, but if you are thinking that drinking PBR in a South End tapas restaurant is elevating your level of non-temperature cool, you need be set straight. A good rule of thumb, is that if you can get a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters with a particular beer logo on it, that beer probably isn't consumed for it's quality. Or coolness anymore for that matter.Short version is, Toro is good. It ain't great.

I have dreams about the corn. Whenever anyone mentions the restaurant, wherever I am, whoever I'm with, I always respond with, \"The corn! The corn!\" I love the way it is grilled, but really all I think about is how it is absolutely smothered in heavenly cheesiness. There is so much cheesy goodness to go around: roll the corn in it to cover every inch, smear it on every tiny kernel, lick it off every finger, and then use the bread to mop up whatever is left on the plate. The servers are awesome about coming around and giving you clean plates, but that means they'll swap it for your used one--don't be afraid to tell them you've got some cheese left on that plate and you plan to use it! Aside from the corn(!), I also always insist on getting the datiles. Sweet and savory, bite-sized and filled with blue cheese, these little guys only come two to an order so make sure there are enough to go around. I have had the salt-crusted sea bass for two, and it was every bit as delicious as I expected. But, I have to admit, it's much more fun to order a bunch of the tapas for sharing. I like variety in every meal and Toro is the place to go for that. My latest favorite dish is the duck drumettes. The meat practically fell off the bone and the sauce made it so sweet, almost candied, but with hints of saltiness for a perfect balance. Again, more eating with your hands, which leads to licking off your fingers. This is not a great first date place if you really want to get into the food. For every bite of the corn, you'll need about a yard of floss.

Dates with almonds wrapped in jamon - I call this the hot date. Burnt the crap out of my tongue when I stuck it in my mouth, but it was totally worth it! I loved this. Sweet and salty and meaty.

Grass fed beef heart - it seriously tasted like rare roast beef. Perfectly chewy, and just... meaty. With a tangy tomatoey sauce. Yum! Veal sweetbread - I honestly don't know what a sweetbread is (something about a gland of some sort in between the heart and lungs or something? I'll have to wiki it at some point). :) But... YUUUUUUUUM. A mouthful of goodness. It's seriously like two perfect bites (great for two people!). And so good! Blood sausage - it tasted like soondae, Korean blood sausage.

SO bad for you, but SO good. And that pumpkin puree was so amazingly good, we sopped all of it up with the bread they brought us. Smoked duck drumettes - it tasted like pork spareribs. Seriously.

Although, I do agree with one of the previous reviewers - the foam was a bit off putting. Just serve me simple dishes with simple ingredients. But still... executed very well.

My girlfriend was taking me to the Boston Symphony on her tab, so treatnig her to Ken Oringer's palette of Barthelonan (excuse me, Barcelonan) bites was the least that I could do.Now, it's a bit off base to compare tapas to Korean food, but the comparison explains why I remain paradoxically reverent and skeptical of this style of food.While dicovering tapas is like the invention of eIectricity to some people, I've already grown up privy to a cuisine (Korean) that regularly showcases endless bits of intensely flavored pickled, spicy, smoky, meaty, fatty food containing elements rarely seen in the average American diet (octopi, snails, bone marrow, anchovies). I've grown up taking for granted that such food is a necessary companion to drink, and vice versa. So, I'm convinced that the culture of tapas was once similarly down-home, thus I slightly resent the uptight prices. Yet, I am powerless to criticize the food. This flat-roofed, one-story restaurant owned by worldly East Coast native Ken Oringer is a stop of world class food along a wide stretch of Washington Street in the increasingly hip South End. neighbors include an ugly/familiar CVS, and the famous Flour bakery is across the corner. Don't expect to crave any pastries after you've Toro-ly stuffed yourself, though.The consensus is to arrive early. I agree. At 5, people were already ecstatic to share the solid wood tables in the 55 seat place, which feels roomier precisely because of this cap on guests. Reservations are not allowed and the hostesses will not seat you unless all members of your party are present. It was a blessing in disguise that my friend was still struggling to find street parking, because I had no choice in her absence but to sit at the bar and have my first sherry drinking experience.Got lucky by harnessing the attention of an apt bartender (go figure, the Latin looking one, but of course not Spanish). He put me at ease as he explained the nuances of each and poured samples. I selected the Tio Pepe Fino, described as having a \"fresh nose with brine and yeast, tangy, warm finish.\" This thrilled me because I avoided sherry for so many years thinking it was all sweet, probably from one childhood swig from a bottle of creme sherry that someone had gifted to my parents while Reagan was in office. My glass of Tio had zero sugar, and did indeed evoke freshness and the sea. It seemed mild, but got me buzzed enough to clamor for a tallboy of 'Gansett right afterwards.When my friend settled in with some high-falutin red, we ate:Pimientos del Padron - \"Hot green peppers with sea salt\"Sounds awful simple for $7, yet it was one of my top picks.Datiles con Jamon - Basically meat fat, bleu cheese, and natural sugar. Can't go wrong with this candy.Croquetas de Bacalao - Nothing tricky about these breaded spheres of cod, except that the insides were hotter than hell itself and we both burnt ourselves. Another surprise; I ate the lemon rings like they were onion rings.Pan con Tomate - Little bits of hard bread, a tiny bowl of pasty tomato dip, ancovies, salt and oil! As always, it was mildly stressful portioning the bread to the paste.Costilla de Buey -\"Rioja braised short rib of beef with armagnac soaked prunes and pommes puree\" - now this actually tasted Korean (like jangjorim), and was the most filling selection.Asado de Huesos - The marrow in its canoe of bone was the texture of melting lard that turns liquid in your mouth. Next to this, the \"radish citrus salad\" seemed but a garnish. A tasty one, though, as I ate it all.Even while full, I wanted to try the Catalan sea urchin stew! The crispy pork belly with escargot and maple crumble! The Kobe beef mini-burgers! The smoked duck drumettes with quince glaze! But I couldn't have it all when compromise was the word.In a big mob, you'd have to really hustle to get these dishes down your throat before someone else snapped it up. With only one other person, it was a tense charade of courtesy (\"You eat it...\" \"No, you eat it...\" \"are you sure?\" \"Yes, go ahead...\" \"Really?\" \"It's fine!\") as you both realize you were hungrier than you ever thought. It's a weird dynamic, which is probably why drinking is encouraged.

We enjoyed a show of young Boston boys (didn't see the chefs) scurrying about the open kitchen, restocking ingredients in tiny fridges, and blackening endless sections of corn-on-the-cob on an industrial griddle.

Moreover, the dame I was courting was a big fan of small plates and I was determined to find someplace better than her go-to haunt (BarLola). It was a Monday evening and the fickle gods of New England weather had dumped a generous snowfall on the Hub of the Universe. Thus, I figured that Toro -- notorious for its lengthy waits and unwillingness to accept reservations for just a couple -- might have a table for me and my lady friend.Parking, as expected, was a trial. Despite the winter storm, the place was filled to capacity. The host estimated thirty minutes and we strafed to the bar. I admired the decor -- loving it -- whilst my date ordered up a couple of glasses of wine (my tempranillo was overpriced but tasty). Soon thereafter, we were seated at a window-side table for two in the corner of the restaurant. Pleased to have avoided the cafeteria-style seating monstrosity in the center of the dining area, we barely noticed the mild draft from the large pane of glass looking out on Washington Street.Our server -- a pleasant young man with a slight accent -- was very helpful in the selection process, daunting for a pair that would have tried just about anything and everything on the menu (excepting the dishes featuring cilantro or mushrooms). We settled on la especialidad de la casa (maiz asado con alioli y queso cotija), garbanzos con chorizo and atun crudo. The tuna (yellowfin) was excellent and, yet, the least impressive of the lot. The chickpeas and chorizo dish was perfect (I deferred on the hard-boiled egg) but the star of the show was the grilled corn. Sure, it was messy and each of us worried, momentarily, about appearing slovenly in front of the other. Then our taste buds overrode our manners and our mouths and lips became caked in delectable, lime-accented aged cheese.The sole disappointment was the sangria. Prior to the aforementioned dame losing interest and, consequently, kicking me to the curb -- we'll pause for sympathetic sighs -- we'd planned to sample and score every batch of sangria in the Greater Boston area.

Modern interior with dim lighting. When we arrived it was around 7-8pm. There was a waiting list but fortunately, there was a bar to kill some time. I ordered the sangria. It was lovely. Very fruity. Not bitter at all.We didn't wait long. Maybe 10 minutes. I didn't know what to order so I trusted my friends to order anything and everything they felt was delicious.And I'm letting you know rite now...I was NOT disappointed! Not one bit!If you don't know what tapas are they're basically a variety of snacks and finger foods in Spanish cuisine. The portions allow you to try many different items on the menu. Instead of digging into one dish you can nibble on a little bit of everything.Before I get to my favorite dishes, I sincerely have to thank my junior high Spanish teacher Mr. Adonay (R.I.P.) for making us do those ridiculous skits in which we had to order food in Spanish. That class, specifically those skits, really helped when reading the menu =)Popular dishes of the nite:-Datiles con Jamon: dates filled with almonds and bleu cheese and wrapped in ham. I didn't think I would like dates but it was very sweet and savory.-Gambas al Ajillo: grilled garlic shrimp.-Patatas Bravas: fried potatoes with alioli and spicy tomato sauce.-Paella Valenciana: it had a great taste. They weren't stingy with the seafood and sausages. The flavor was on point. But would I really pay almost $40 for it? I'm afraid not but it's worth a try.-Pato con Membrillo: smoked duck drummettes with quince glaze. Ooooh m'mmmm =) Very juicy, moist and finger-lickin' good.But the most favored dish of them all...the crowning achievement, the jewel of the nite, the piece de resistance!...*MAIZ ASADO CON ALIOLI Y QUESO COTIJA: grilled corn with alioli, lime, pepper and aged cheese. This corn isn't just great...it's superb! The moment that dish is set on your table, your mouth begins to water and your eyes glaze over. The degree of melting gooey butter and cheese wrapping around the corn like a warm thick blanket is just...amazing. Grilled to perfection. And once you take that first bite...rite after you've drizzled lime over it...no words can describe the impact it has given you. The juices, the creaminess, the flavor! Oh my! It totally rocked my word.You can't go to Boston without heading to this place. The only downside is that the prices are a bit steep. I mean seriously...$40 paella!?

Unfortunately, the line of angry patrons waiting for a table would start a riot after a couple hours. Getting a reservation is impossible since they don't take any, so show up early. We lucked into getting seated after five minutes when a table happened to open up during peak dinner service. The tables are cramped, but it makes for better company. At first glance, the dinner menu is completely overwhelming, but you probably can't go wrong with any of the small plates. We started with a couple of pinchos, including the Atun Tartare (tuna) and the Corazon. The mint and cilantro were strong flavors, which took a lot away from what I would want from a tuna tartare. The Corazon (smoked buffalo heart with romesco) is an adventurous but popular dish, which is comparable to pastrami. If I were to order again, I would stick to the tapas calientes section of the menu. The Pato con Membrillo (smoked duck drumettes with quince glaze) was my favorite plate of the night. The glaze was amazing and had me sucking the bone dry. The Ma\u00edz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija La Especialidad de la Casa was a close second. Who knew grilled corn could taste so spectacular with a dollop of aioli and sprinkled with aged cheese. It was excellente! Lastly, the Panza de Cerdo (crispy pork belly) melts in your mouth if you're a fan of pork belly. The small fried potatoes were reminiscent of gnocchi, but with a crispy exterior.Overall, the tapas here is top notch and the service isn't too shabby either.

The meat was dry and the sesame sauce sweet and one-dimensional.Patatas bravas - Generous but unremarkable portion served with aioli and a smoky red sauce. Husband actually commented that they tasted like bbq potato chips.Tongue with lentils - like a St. Patty's corned beef all dressed up.Special of pork belly with fried green tomato - Crispy, fatty and smartly paired with the cornmeal(?) dusted tomato.Grilled corn - slathered with soured cream, lime, cilantro, chili and cojito cheese.

Not really that we experienced, perhaps, if being picky the salt cod fritters were a little cheesy, and the place was absolutely jumping, so we were lucky to have arrived by 6.30 on a Friday night. We had the choice of being in or outdoors, and the weather forecast wasnt that great, so we decided to go inside, however we were placed at a table that was soooo cramped to the adjacent ones that we changed our mind and decided to take a chance with the elements. Totally right decision and one which might have saved the perfect 5 rating of this review.That aside, we were not rushed to leave we were able to sit for ages and chat and enjoy our romantic dinner a deux.

With no reservation and arriving around 7:30, it was packed to the gills so we waited 45 minutes for a table. As long as you're up for a little tightly-packed mingling at the bar, the wait for a table is well worth it and perfectly bearable, as the bartender mixes a gosh darn good cocktail.Once seated at a quaint table for two, our experience continued swimmingly. The waitress was relaxed, despite Toro's overwhelming popularity for a Tuesday, allowing us plenty of time to peruse the menu at our leisure. And we did so leisurely! Having not seen each other in years, my dining partner and I took a half hour with the menu as we caught up on lost time. Finally ready to order, we chose the following:Grilled Corn - specialty of the house, very tasty with a butter/mayo sauce and melted cheese on top. Delicious, but messy... no corn skewer handle things? There is simply no way to avoid getting sloppy with this dish, but it's worth it!Cuttlefish - served in a bowl with some seasonings and sauce, this one was also pretty good.Yellowfin sashimi - this was really good. Six or so pieces of bite-sized tuna served with some sort of topping and scallions, definitely a repeater.Bone Marrow - my favorite of the 4 dishes tried, a huge bone is served on a wooden plank with two shortrib-covered toasts. Take a piece of the toast, spread a dollop of bone marrow atop the shortrib, open mouth and enjoy! And enjoy you will - this dish is decadent and scrumptious, a perfect complement to the snowy weather outside.Toro will certainly be on the shortlist for a revisit next time I'm in Boston. The space is small but ample, and makes for a fun, lively atmosphere when it easily fills up with a mostly young but seemingly well-to-do clientele, which isn't a surprise considering its location in the actively gentrifying South End. The only thing keeping Toro from attaining that ever-elusive 5th star: service. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The hostess was a bit 'rhymes-with-witch'y, failing to take our name down for a table until I went to confirm that she had after sitting at the bar for a while. Again, it wasn't bad, and it was really crowded, but a little work on the service and this place would be unbeatable.All that said, I look forward to my next Toro experience", "Date": "2010-12-31", "Author_Location": "Lincoln, MA"}, {"Author": "Brad B.", "ReviewID": "fr-8csBpd33wSATD52JM1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the Toro.Group of friends toddle into Toro on a Friday night.

I know it's in the spirit of Spanish tradition, but I just think they must do it a little different and provide bigger portions in Spain, serving it more family style. Cost controls aside, Toro is a very cool place. Between the smells of saute'd garlic and wood burning in their real fireplace, this establishment immediately provides you a sense of comfort, warmth, and coziness as soon as you walk in. Now this was winter time, so I loved the fireplace and the warmth inside, not sure what it's like on a hot humid night in Boston, but I am sure I can find out.I went with a male friend and didn't feel like we were on a \"date\" or have a weird feeling of asking \"is this gay?\" when we shared some of the Tapas dishes. I guess a homophobic person could be concerned with the small tables and share and share alike type of attitude. This is an ideal place for friends or a date, or members of the same sex that are securing in their \"manhood\". The food was excellent, I had a cheese sampler, some duck confit, duck legs, tuna, brussel sprouts, and a salad. Overall prices weren't too bad it came to about 80$ for 4 drinks, and all the food we had. For 2 people that isn't that bad. \u00a0Though portions aren't big, so I made sure to eat some of the whole grain bread they serve with the meal.Tapas restaurants aren't for the picky, or those that can never decide on what to order, you really need to just dive right into the menu and just try a bunch of different things.

The tortilla Espanola was also fairly average in comparison with what we had in Spain. The mini-Kobe hamburgers are an odd thing to have on the menu in the first place, but we wanted to try them, and I was very disappointed.

We thought all of the food was incredible, robust in flavor and memorable although my favorites were the corn, Mini Kobe Burgers and the Duck. The Mexican cheese they use on the corn was so tasty I asked my server where I could buy it from. Uhm...Wow! The marinade on the duck legs gave it that sweet almost-terriyaki feel which just made it so damn good. And the Kobe Burgers were some of the best I ever had. Perfectly grilled and bursting with flavor.The Salt Cod Fritters were sort of just standard but the aioli they used on them certainly gave it a nice tart flavor. The Tuna Tartare was slightly bland but still, there was something about it that would make me order another one the next time I go. The service was good. At first I didn't know who the server was but after my hibiscus-infused tequila cocktail with ginger & lime came about I don't think it mattered all that much.The wine list has some good options on it and the cocktail menu is very nice, though a little heavy on the gin (is someone sleeping with Hendricks over there)?All in all it was great to fantastic.

(portion was small tho)Serrano Ham & Iowa raised ham - MOUTHWATERING, each bite left me wanting more. Sliced thin, right amount of intense saltiness. Generous board portion.Queso Cotija Corn: Sweet, cheesy, succulent corn on the cob, charred to perfection and smothered with LOVE. Roasted Bone Marrow: good, not the best I've had it was a little more salty than I expected. BUT the shredded beef toasts on the side were FREAKING amazing! Serve me a plate of that and I'm set. The meat tasted like it had been slow cooked for days, simmering in its beefy goodness.Panza De Cerdo - Roasted Pork Belly. Good solid dish, not my fave but good.Asparagus - DAMN unassuming spears of asparagus? YUmmie. fresh, good mix of crunch from the green almonds and pickled ramps.Garbanzo Con Chorizo - Husband said it was the best chorizo he ever had, not a ton of orange grease, super flavorful down right comfort food, savory Garbanzos. Though I think this could have benefited from some pan fried crisp garbanzo's sprinkled on top. That's how I make it at home.Special of the day: Braised Short Rib Paella - Amazing! savory, morsels of mushy risotto type rice with a burnt nutty bottom. Tender braised short rib meat throughout the dish gave it that \"I want a bowl of this on a very cold rainy day\" feel. hell I'd eat it any day tho.Fried Churos - These were tasty, nothing different.

I was so looking forwarding to eating your spanish tapas and transporting myself to my European adventures years ago. Unfortunately, I didn't leave the dreary cold Boston south-end.Hubby and walked into Toro to a packed lunch seating. Honestly, it doesn't bother me that much that they don't take reservations. Toros atmosphere is very casual/trendy (waiters in jeans and black shirts, metal chairs) so first come first serve works for them and the vibe they are going for. All the tables were taken and we were happy to sit at the bar. Ambience is very very nice! Really like the exposed brick look with a hammered mirror on one side, and a long bar with a chalkboard of specials on the other. I commented to my hubby that I love how they picked only wine bottles with red, orange and yellow labels to display! The toros all over the place were cute but not clique. There's a prep area at the end of the restaurant, that we were informed by a friend of the chefs who was sitting next to us, that they use to cut up whole pigs at. Interesting. Tables are family style. We didn't sit at a table but I could see how annoying it would be for romantic date night where you're sitting 6 inches away from a stranger... Seemed like they were a bit understaffed for lunch. One hostess/waitress and the bartender, so it took a little while for someone to come over and take our orders. Both of us ordered cocktails. I tried their house made (i believe) hibiscus tequila in mine and very much enjoyed its lingeringly sweet aftertaste. Both came in highball glasses that were perfect for the cocktails we ordered but the guy next to us was served a glass of red wine and it came in a highball too. Again I understand the casual, trendy look - but if I order wine I want my red wine in a real wine glass please.Ok, we ordered:Pan con Tomate- Toasted bread with crushed tomatoes, garlic and olive oil on it. A spanish take on bruchetta. Hubby was annoyed at the seasoning. It seemed they just threw salt onto it. One bite was really salty, the next bland, the next perfect. frustrating.Datiles con Jamon- This was mouthful of heaven. Dates, bluecheese, almonds. Perfect mixture. If only I didn't have the thought in the back of my head \"damn this 1 bite is $3\"...Corazon a la Plancha: Best thing we had on the menu! Hands down! The beef heart was moist, tender and flavorful. The romesco sauce paired perfectly with it. Get over that you're eating beef heart and try it!Gambas al Ajillo: YUCK! I love shrimp. I love living in Boston where fresh seafood is at your backdoor. I hated this! First you can't just plop sauce on top of shrimp and expect it to taste good. You need to marinate it so the flavors soak down into the shrimp. We got 4 large shrimp in this bowl of red liquid. The sauce had no flavor. No heat, no spice, no salt, and saddest of all no acid! The worst was when you pick up the shrimp the sauce slides off and you're left with a totally plain (rather fishy smelling) shrimp and a big mess all over the table. Don't order.Anna's Empanadas: Chicken and potato empanadas. Tasty, but nothing to write home about. I don't know what they were going for but the crust was cornmeal so I felt like I was eating a big corndog with no seasoning. Wish that the aioli had more flavor too.Milanesa Bocadillo: Chicken sandwich with avocado and beans. What really made me sad was the chicken was FRIED, which meant the more we ate the greasier it got. Then they threw a whole avocado in the sandwich, unseasoned just a raw avocado. Which made the sandwich dry and tasteless. I desperately wanted a little heat, a little sauce to dip the sandwich, in a little lime on the avocado, something! I had to keep chugging my drink to get it down. The ambience is great, but you have to have great food as well in order to charge the crazy prices they charged. Def had buyers remorse when we got our tab. Was what we ate worth that price? We both decided no. Enjoyed trying this place and can see how the masses love the new concept and are lining up try it, but don't think that we'll be back; especially if we have to wait and hour to get in for mediocre service and unflavored food.

I have been back many times since that first visit (never returning on a Thursday, however...just in case it was the off night luck a specific day of the week. Supersticious much?) The things I said in my original review still hold true: You cannot beat the price for the tapas. The drinks are good, but they will run up the tab if you are not careful. Otherwise, great food, and an easy choice to bring out-of-towners when visiting, as it is always a hit. From picky to adventurous eaters, bring them all, and the variety is great. A friend of mine who lived in Spain (=knows authentic tapas) rated it as one of his top 10 best meals ever...we ordered every semi-exotic-sounding item on the menu...and how can you not when you see the board of bone marrow passing your table?And Sunday brunch is perfectly portioned and relaxed. The selection of brunch itself is limited, but the regular fare is available. My favorite: Huevos rancheros with a side order of the grilled avocado thrown on top. Get a blood orange mimosa in my hand when I walk through the door, and I am happy as a churro in Disneyland. The day ambiance is relaxed, but the busy rush of the dinner hour is also electric.On a side note, I have witnessed people wait up to 3.5 hours for a table here, which proved to me there is no time limit too long to wait for Toro.", "Date": "2009-08-10", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Tanya C.", "ReviewID": "lkd2xHXnot7Tx4L5LPgsCg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best tapas in boston, hands down.

Not only known for the tapas (small plates), paella, sangria, they have the best churros.Dessert first. Alas, I have found the best churros in Boston at Toro. Thin, crispy, thin and dusted with sugar and cinnamon. They are served with a side dish of orange liqueur flavored chocolate. Although the churros are tasty with the dipping chocolate, they are perfect eating them alone.At the Luxardo brunch, with special Italian and Spanish fusion dishes, we chose huevos rancheros, Italian bolognese patatas bravas, jamon wrapped dates and elote (mexican corn).My favorite savory dish of the brunch was the bolognese patatas bravas. The potatoes were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and sopped up the red sauce. The runny yolk of the egg on the bolognese gave an additional richness to the already luxurious dish.The medjool datiles were filled with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese, wrapped in Jamon Serrano. The blue cheese was slightly too strong, but overall the saltiness of the jamon and sweetness of the dates were similar to eating a fleur de sel caramel.The huevos rancheros were served in a cast iron skillet with the toasted tortillas on the side, versus in within the dish. The crema, salsa roja and runny eggs were a bit too watery, but the flavor with cotija cheese and black beans was balanced.I had such high expectations for the corn, but unfortunately the grilled corn was not fresh (most of the kernals were dry) and slathered with too much aioli, to the point it was overpowering the lime and cotija and difficult to enjoy without removing a majority of the aioli.", "Date": "2011-08-26", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Noir L.", "ReviewID": "s2R4ZEKO0BALEXVNftuAbg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm in love with this place.

Very nice and well presented, if a wee bit salty.Tapas - Shrimp were great! The sauce was soooo good I kept dipping my bread in it.The eggplant was very very tasty, wish it came in a larger serving. Mussels were all right, a bit small and about half of them were just shell and no meat. A little disappointing considering I just had some fantastic mussels last week at Aquitaine (also with chorizo!). The bone marrow dish was superbly presented, modern + rustic at the same time. The beef had a slight tang to it, quite interesting. I can't say the marrow tasted particularly spectacular - it just tasted like marrow. But the presentation really made it shine.Dessert - Manchego was nice, the membrillo was extremely sweet. Churro was pretty standard tasting, the chocolate sauce was thick and not too sweet.Overall quite a nice experience!

Eight of us went here on a Tuesday night for my friend's birthday. The place was jammed and it was a small space - I was actually pretty impressed because I felt that this most likely spoke to its popularity and the quality of the food. There was also a vast age range of people at the restaurant. The whole experience though was a bit awkward. My friend was quoted a half hour wait - we arrived after them.

My friend's sister went to speak with the host and hostess and it just seemed like an uncomfortable conversation (although I didn't overhear all of it). We saw them clearing and resetting a table AROUND two people still left sitting at the table from the original party that was sitting there. The hostess told us to go ahead and sit at the table with the two other people sitting there....awkward. The other part of it was that there were not enough seats at the table set up so essentially those two poor people still enjoying their conversation were pushed out of the table! I was a little bit mortified. I just don't know why they told us to go sit down when there were two of us without chairs and two people we didn't know still not done with their drinks! It was strange... Anyways, the rumors about the corn are true - it's amazing. It was, by far, the best thing on the menu that I tried that evening. The potatoes and Kobe sliders were ok.

However, I definitely did not want to wait the long wait people have been talking about. So, my friend and I decided the best time would be brunch! I called in to make a reservation - they don't take any reservations. Keep that in mind! No wonder the waits are as horrible as I've been reading them. In addition to not taking reservations, the place is relatively small and since they're known in town for their tapas, the wait can get pretty long. So we came for brunch, and I'm happy to report that we waited 2 minutes :) I do believe that doesn't even constitute as a wait!Anyway, right when I walked in, I noticed the decor of this place and kinda fell in love with it. Bottles of wine line the walls on both sides and there's a bar where bartenders make their concoctions that only they can. There's a board that is updated every day with their specialties as well so make sure to check them IN ADDITION to the menu that is handed to you.The brunch menu includes your regular fair breakfast, but also the tapas! Which is what we went on since we wanted to try Toro's specialties. Between the two of us we split 5 dishes and honestly we could have eaten more, but I'm glad we kept room for dessert later :).1. Foie Gras con Chutney de Pera - I'd heard such great things about this I had to give it a try. First, I had no idea what Foie Gras was - it's duck liver for those who scratch their heads when reading the name. All in all it was a good dish, but I wasn't that impressed. I believe liver is an acquired taste - you either like it or don't. And while I love chicken liver, I wasn't a fan of the duck one. Overall: Good, not great.2. Atun Crudo - This was yellowfish tuna with citrus and soy and I liked this much more than the duck liver. Thumbs up!3. Ma\u00edz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija - this is their house specialty! And quite filling for a tapas plate! It's grilled corn lime and aged cheese on it. All I can say is I loved this dish! I'm a fan of corn all in all, and mix that with another favorite of mine, cheese - I'm a happy camper :)4. Escalivada Catalana - OMG. My favorite tapas of the meal, hands down. It's a burst of flavors in your mouth from the get go. I am so glad my friend decided to order this. I was skeptical in the beginning, but when I had my first spoonful....OMG. DEF A MUST for veggie lovers and non veggies alike!5. Hamburguesas de Kobe - I don't eat steak, but my friend ordered this for himself and LOVED it. He said it was a very close second to the eggplant and I'll agree it did look good. Plus it was a fair amount of steak as well.The price for all the 5 dishes came out to a little less than 50 total (tip no inclusive), which is great!

As many have mentioned, the portion sizes are small (tapa size). However, the flavor sure makes up for it-the food was very rich and decadent. All of us at the end of the night were full and satisfied. The prices were not as steep as I would have expected. I believe we paid $42 each with tax and tip for 10 dishes and 1 dessert.

I went here with a friend for Restaurant Week and, unlike those restaurants that shove forth their cheapest, most uninventive fare during this event, Toro's offerings really showcased its talents well.Between the two of us, we ordered a multitude of dishes to share. The portion sizes are small--tasting sizes really--but each bite packed in so much flavour that there's no way to leave unsatisfied. Here's a breakdown:Ensalada Favorita (Romaine, tahini-miso dressing, grilled croutons, radishes, carrots and mahon cheese): nice and refreshing, but nothing too special. The nutty dressing contrasted well with the crunchy greens. A good way to balance our meat-heavy meal but otherwise, something that you can easily make at home.Datiles con Jamon (Medjool dates filled with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese, wrapped in Jamon Serrano): \u00a0The salty-sweet dialogue that the chef was aiming for didn't really balance out, as I found \u00a0the sweetness of the date a bit too overpowering! Great flavour combo, just a bit too intense on the sweet side.Atun Tartare (Tuna tartare with coconut milk, calamansi lime and cilantro): HIghly recommended. Tuna tartare gently seasoned so as to still allow the tuna-ness to shine through, served with toast. Very refreshing.Mollejas (Kung Pao style sweetbreads with blood orange, fermented black beans and hazelnuts): Very Asian flavours at work here. Two pieces of fried sweetbreads with a tangy sweet and sour sauce. I'm not a big fan of sweet + sour but the sweetbreads were excellent: great textural contrast between the crispy outside and the creamy insides.Uni Bocadillo (Pressed uni sandwich with miso butter and pickled mustard seeds): This dish was featured (along with the sweetbreads) in Food Network's \"Unique Eats.\" I LOVE uni, and I love how they served it heated up but still uncooked so that it retains its creaminess and gooey texture, but the miso made it waaayyy too salty. Diluting the saltiness with another piece of bread worked, but lessening the salt would much improve this otherwise impressive dish.Coliflor a la Plancha (Cauliflower with pine nuts, golden raisins and pimenton de la vera): Get a bit of each ingredient in one bite. Flawless.Fennel sausage with pimento sauce: Perfectly spiced sausage paired with a sweet-spicy pimento salsa. No complaints here at all.For dessert we had the manchego cheese with quince paste, which tasted as good as this classic combination goes (I'm not a big fan of hard cheeses so I don't have much to say about it). The churros with chocolate sauce also garner no complaints.Delicious meal, impressive flavours, and inventive combinations.

Acorn ham -- Quercia -- a little saltier than the serrano but equally good3. Serrano wrapped dates with blue cheese (Cabrales). My companions loved this. I don't like cabrales cheese (eww goat flavor)4. Chili Beans (had a fancier name, cannot remember it). AWESOME. Ground pork with lots of chili and cinnamon with small white beans. One of the favorites of the evening5. Garbanzos con Chorizo -- I am Puerto Rican, so I guess I can compare this to the pinto beans with the red tomato, smoky sauce (gisado). My mom would make chickpeas like this for some variation on the pinto or red kidney beans. This was pretty much comfort food to me and I started missing having a plate of Arroz Blanco with it.6. Atun Crudo and Atun Pincho. One was a tuna tartare with coconut milk, garlic (I didn't have this as I am allergic to garlic), and a lime foam. The atun crudo was a soy citrus tuna sashimi plate. AMAZING. I could have eaten 3 of these on my own :)7.Short Rib -- this was melt in your mouth, LEAN (yeah, I couldn't believe it either) marinated with rioja and served with armagnac prunes and creamed potatoes. LOVED this.8. Kobe Sliders (they gave us three for the same price as two!) Butter beef with a tasty homemade ketchup type sauce. It also comes with pickeled red onion and alioli *garlic mayo*...but due to my allergies, I had mine with ketchup only.9. Asado de Huesos -- roasted marrow. I did not try this, but my marrow loving friends really liked it.10. Asparagus with Jamon Blanco -- tasty and hellooooo lardo!11. Maiz with cotija and alioli (again, due to allergies, I had this with the pepper and cotija and loved it.

I got tripe (which was tender and came in a delicious tomato-based sauce), beef tongue, oxtail on croutons which had a really intense flavor like it was almost jerkied, bone marrow which was incredibly generous and oily/delicious, and sweetbreads which were crisped on the outside and came speared on cinnamon which was a very surprising combination of flavors.It's not all about the beef either. The seafood offerings were great too. We got the catalan stew of uni and crab. It was very rich, very fragrant and had a milky foam on it that tasted like almonds. I would like to go back and try the oysters since they looked very tasty.The most memorable item I had was the duck ham, which were four strips of thinly shaved cured meat, very red, with this border of melt-in-your-mouth fat which would have been too rich on its own, but was terrific with the free bread, which was replenished quite often and a good complement with the tapas.Very interesting drinks to go with the food as well. I got a cider, which was very tart and yeasty. Forgot the name though, you'll know what it is because the waiter will warn you that it isn't sweet like you'd expect.

I always look forward to Chef Ken Oringer's scrumptious sea urchin creations (which he features in different forms at all of his restaurants)...he's like Boston's Uni King! Toro is Chef Oringer's take on Spanish cuisine. Tomato and Watermelon Gazpacho - ahhhhh, so refreshing on a hot day. The gazpacho was served really cold (rather than just chilled) and effortlessly balanced the sweet and salty flavors.Escalivada Catalana - this blend of wood-roasted eggplants, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and olive oil tasted wonderful spread over bread. It was thick, slightly sweet, and whet my appetite for the procession of small plates to come. Uni Bocadillo - WOW! I relished in the bold flavors of this pressed uni sandwich with miso butter and pickled mustard seeds. Although the uni could have been fresher, it tasted soooooo good with the miso butter...biting through that hot, crispy bread into buttery, ocean flavors with a sharp zing from the mustard seeds. Mmmm! Za'atar and Honey Glazed Pork Ribs - the sweet honey was a perfect complement to the Moroccan spice. The meat was a bit dry, but still fell right off the bones. The yogurt also added a cooling touch to the dish. Overall, the flavors brought a lightness to the otherwise heavy ribs. Panza de Cerdo (crispy pork belly with sunchoke, escargot, fava beans and smoked maple crumble) - a fiesta of flavor! So many ingredients and tastes, all enhancing one another. The pork belly was cooked to perfection...meaty and fatty with a super, crispy layer of skin. The escargot was tender and smoky, adding a unique element to the dish. Erizos en Suquet (Catalan stew of sea urchin, lobster and crab meat) - it was like a rich and thick seafood bouillabaisse. While the taste of shellfish was evident in the stew, it was so salty that the sweet flavors of the lobster and crab meat were lost.

The coupon came with a reservation, so there was no wait, we just walked right in, got handed glasses of Cava, and the deliciousness started...First up was tomato toast, which was a basic dish and a decent start-- grilled bread with tomato innards and salt on top. Kind of like a more basic bruschetta, without all the extras. Next we had tiny sardines in olive oil, and two raw oysters with a citrus foam that made the whole bite taste creamy and lemony, and almost like a savory lemon sherbet. Also a dish of tiny roasted green peppers, which were mild and reminded me of edamame in terms of the vegetable-ness paired with oil and sprinklings of salt. Then we had a tuna tartare with coconut milk and crispy shallots (tasty but I admit I prefer it Japanese-style), and some cooked tuna on bread with some accompaniments I can no longer remember.Next up was my personal favorite-- an uni bocadillo. Think grilled cheese sandwich, only instead of cheese it was sea urchin roe. So sweet, so creamy, so crispy on the outside, just perfection. If you ever have the opportunity to order it, do so!After the seafood we had a charcuterie plate with two kinds of ham and pork pate, then an empanada with garlic aioli and tomatillo sauce. Then we had fried sweetbreads with a black bean/orange sauce (a little sweet for my taste), and some delicious roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and golden raisins.By this point we were up to 11 dishes and I was getting extremely full, but the plates kept coming! We had a plate of perfectly crispy potatoes with aioli and tomato sauce, and a braised beef cheek over quinoa which I was too full to do more than nibble at. Then the house specialty roasted corn (again, just nibbled, but it was tasty-- could've used more lime). Last up was a pair of churros with a deep chocolate sauce-- perfectly acceptable, but I like my churros less eggy, so I didn't even try to make room in my already-distended stomach for more than a bite.I feel sure I'm missing a dish or two in there, because I thought I remembered us counting up to 16-17 dishes, but honestly, I can't remember any others specifically. Must have been all the wine. Did I mention the wine? We were each offered seven-- count 'em, SEVEN-- glasses of wine in total-- Cava, two whites (bland), three reds (all delicious), and a glass of port.

Sweet and boozy: a potentially troublesome combination if you have any after-dinner plans. I had a few different drinks (all great!) throughout the evening, but this one sticks out the most. For Pinchos, we had: Datiles con Jamon--A perfect bite with an awesome sweet filling. \u00a0Top 3 for the night.Foie Gras with Fig--Such a pleasant blend of savory and sweet on a crostini, perfect consistency and taste for the Foie Gras. \u00a0The fig was just what this dish needed for balance.For Tapas, we had: Costilla de Buey--Short ribs were so tender they practically fell apart, coupled with hazelnuts. Top 3 for the night.Maiz Asado con Aioli y Queso Cotija--Ah, yes. The infamous corn dish. If there was ever a dish that makes you feel like you should be taking a trip to fat camp at meal's end, this is probably it! \u00a0But guess what? You'll still be thanking yourself while running laps! \u00a0The flavor combination was so unbelievable! \u00a0A must have for any visitors. \u00a0Top 3 for the night.Though I did love a majority of the dishes I tried, I feel it would be a disservice to the Yelp crowd to not list some of the dishes that I found slightly underwhelming in comparison. \u00a0The Atun Tartare was, at least for me, a little bland. \u00a0Additionally, the churros (dessert) were also a little underwhelming, as I was expecting something bolder to cap off the meal. \u00a0Let's just say when your worst complaint is \"underwhelming\" after singing praises on 14(!) other dishes, it's a pretty damn good meal.The Service & Ambience - One thing I instantly loved about Toro was their laid-back atmosphere and staff. \u00a0The service was terrific and fluid, the staff was incredibly helpful (lots of great recommendations), and the entire restaurant felt low-key for such a great dining experience. \u00a0I can't begin to recommend Toro enough. \u00a0If you're looking for amazing food in a relaxed atmosphere, this is the place!", "Date": "2012-11-18", "Author_Location": "Quincy, MA"}, {"Author": "Alaina H.", "ReviewID": "QsGaqrObKaNwkgmEsBaUlA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh.

All we could think was, 'tapas', and the only place at 11 PM on Saturday night that seemed appealing was Toro.Needless to say, I have dined here previously multiple times, but this occasion was notable for the sheer drunkenness, the Proustian reminiscences of time past, and, of course, the alimentary delights of the evening. We started out with Sangria and Calimocho, while waiting (ah, the wait at Toro - no doubt commented upon numerous times by fellow Yelp-izans so I will not bother) for a table.While continuing with one-upmanship with more stories of Bacchanalian and other conquests of different flavors from years behind, the food began to arrive. First, my personal favorite: the Asado de Huesos - or roasted bone marrow. Slightly nutty, mostly lard, and topped on crusty bread with parsley, one can hardly imagine a more sublime delight for the senses. Next, the senses were marred with the Jamon Serrano Redondo Iglesias - premium cured Spanish ham, contrasting nicely with the subtle flavor of the bone marrow. And of course, a night at Toro is hardly complete without the waiter offering a final repast of Gamon al Ajillo - the grilled garlic shrimp, a delicious snack which obliterates any previous memory of the bone marrow from one's gustatory apparatus.In keeping with the number of Calimochos consumed, little else can be recalled from the night.

Awesome.While I admit that it is generally not wallet-friendly, tapas-style dining tends to be my preferred style because it means that I get to try more dishes and not have 4 servings \u00a0worth of leftovers. Anyway, the best thing I had here was grilled corn!!! It's a little messy to eat and you feel the need to floss immediately after, but it's SO GOOD. Other highlights included the empanadas and the paella. I appreciated that the menu was so adventurous and unique, and based on what I did try, I have no doubt that everything is probably delicious. One dish that did not wow as much as I thought: bone marrow. Maybe this is just personal preference, but I don't understand the hype about bone marrow. It's expensive, the amount of consumable food is tiny, and this 'delicacy' has the price ta to match. I'd much rather eat more tacos or burgers or even another plate of corn! Service is great and they had good wine/beverage recommendations. I loved every single wine I drank here, and the bartender was so nice to let me try a little before I decided it was what I wanted. (I drank a couple glasses over the course of dinner.) I wouldn't recommend coming here for an early (think 1st to 3rd?) date because the no reservation policy and the noise level of the restaurant makes it slightly ill-fitting for someone you're not suuper comfortable with and trying to impress.If you leave your cellphone on the table or bar, servers will come around and put it in an empty glass.

I asked the hostess why we couldn't sit in the middle area since it was unoccupied. They said it was reserved for a party of 20. But i thought you don't take reservations! WTH?! So I put down my phone number just in case a table pops up. We went to a nearby bar and the hostess calls at 715PM since a table opened up. Hallelujah! But wait...apparently the management can't seem to estimate waiting time. Our 3 hour wait went down to 45 mins. At this point, I guess I'm just happy it wasn't 3 hours.We sat down and immediately water and bread came to us which was a plus. We ended ordering about 10 dishes. The highlights were the two ginormous bones on the bone marrow dish which was delicious.The panza de cerdo was superb crispy pork belly. The paella was a heap of rice goodness. The razor clams was the best dish of the night. Red wine sangria was light and fruity.On the flip side, the grilled corn was a tad too creamy. The duck drummettes were tough and lacked flavor. The uni was not fresh, probably frozen. The waitress also forgot the two orders of foie gras we ordered. I think there was miscommunication due to it being very busy as well as catering to the big group in the middle.Overall, I would have gave Toro 5 stars however there was inconsistency when I came back the following Monday. No razor clams were available. The bone marrow dish only had one bone this time. I asked the waitress why is there a difference from last time. She stated that it depends on the bone which is determined by the chef. I have no clue how that makes sense since the bone marrow was definitely less.

Usually when we've tried to go, they tell us it's an hour and a half wait or something, but we figured at 930 PM on a Thursday we'd have no trouble. Fortunately, they were able to seat us right away, but we may have gotten the last available table. It never ceases to amaze me how popular this place is. Atmosphere was trendy/hip - the music is pretty loud and it's noisy in there with lots of people talking. This is a good thing -- you feel like you're \"somewhere.\" I asked the waitress how many tapas we should get. She recommended 2-3 a person. Here's the rundown of what we got:Tomato bread -- this was really good, but it was basically just toasted bread with crushed tomatoes on it. Nothing special.Crudo -- eh. It was good except it had diced radishes on it, which I think was overkill. A little too weird to be good.Razor clams -- never had these before. I don't think I will order them again. The texture was bizarre and they look really unappetizing (long tube like shellfish).Calamari salad -- this was terrible. Like 5-6 cold calamari with mixed greens, pickled onions, and mint. This dish probably cost them $3 to make and cost me $11. The calamari were really soggy and the taste combo was way too odd.Patatas bravas (I think -- it was some potato dish) -- this was just fried potatoes (like home fries) with a side of mayonnaise. There was a little bit of barbecue sauce (or something similar) at the bottom of the bowl, but not enough to save the potatoes from being really dry and starchy. Not worth it.Hamburguesas -- These were great. 2 medium rare sliders with really high quality beef. Awesome.Empanadas -- bland fried corn stuffed with seemingly more mashed up corn. It's supposed to have potato and chicken in it, but the inside was difficult to identify. Tasted like it came from Trader Joe's freezer section.Corn -- this is their specialty, and this was really good. But really awesome corn on the cob is just corn on the cob to me. I don't think it's worth $11 or whatever it is they charged for it.With a cheap bottle of wine, the meal above cost me $143 with tip (2 people). Now I don't mind spending a lot for a great dinner. This was not a great dinner. Some was good, some was bad, some was ugly. The experience was simply not worth the money. I have had better meals for half this much. Now -- I realize I over-ordered, and perhaps I ordered the wrong things.

Alas there is a back story where I sadly must deduct a star. The corn, you say? Yes. The corn. Honestly- this is the only place that I've ever eaten at where I have craved a given food item on an ongoing basis afterward. The corn at Toro is insanely delicious. Charred, smattered with spanish cheese and slathered in a garlic aioli that will make you wonder whether the corn could possibly be the messiah in disguise. The rest of the tapas are inventive and solid, for sure. But who the hell cares about them when you can eat yourself retarded on the corn. Note as well, that the corn was written up in Food & Wine as a thing to eat in Boston, so if being on the cutting edge of gastronomie matters to you, then you'll look super hip when you can take someone here and drop that little factoid. And now for the inevitable downside and why they lose a star. Toro is in an itty bitty space and there simply isn't enough room for all of the people they let in. While the scene there is the typical \"I'm so much cooler than you\" South End scene and is fun to watch from a distance, I'm not so sure I wanted to watch it next to me when I was sharing a long butcher table with it. If you don't get very lucky, you will be sharing your grub at a long table in the center of the restaurant with others. I couldn't help overhearing some poser talk loudly about his interview process with one of the big investment banks in New York to impress his very bored looking date. I was so close to him, I could have reached out and smacked some sense into him, but I was in a state of culinary bliss over the corn so only half-cared. I doubt he got a second date, but I really would have liked my own table so I didn't have to wonder. \u00a0Lesson from this experience? Go to Toro early or late, but don't expect to get in without a wait if you go around meal time. And don't think you're going to have intimate conversation here. Really, you'll go, speak to your party to decide on Tapas and then listen to everyone else's conversation because that's all you'll be able to hear.

Luckily for me I had the weekend free and managed to get in for a quick brunch. Right off the bat I have to say I love everything stylistically about this place (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026). I think it is one of the better designed tapas restaurants I've seen, without going too far down the stereotypical, obvious \"Spanish\" path. It's just enough (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026) to let you know what it is, and enough class to show there's some real thought behind it as well.Since I was dining solo I just grabbed a seat at the bar, and received some warm and very friendly service from the bartender. He was super attentive, and we chatted for quite a bit about other trendy food spots I should check out if I had the time. I love when places can openly talk positively about their competitors; it shows a true love for the food and not just the bottom line. I heard many other people talking about the food here at Toro, and rightfully so, as it's very good. I really wish I had come with a large group, so I could sample even more, because there were so many options on the menu I just didn't have the room for after a big dinner the night before.I decided the best way to approach this meal would just be to order everything I wanted at once, and pick at them all piece by piece. It actually worked out pretty well this way as most of the dishes went with each other or balanced each other perfectly. If anything could be considered the \"main\" dish it would have to be the huevos rancheros (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026), which they serve as eggs over easy in a skillet with black beans, tortillas, salsa roja and cotija cheese. This was one of the better renditions I've had of this classic dish, but I was a little disappointed that the tortillas were described as crispy, yet mine came out kind of floppy, and after sitting in the mix for a while became downright soggy. There also weren't very many, so I wound up with way more egg than tortilla to sop it up with. Next on the list were the pimientos del padron (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026), which are hot green peppers seasoned lightly with sea salt and then I'm guessing roasted for a little while. I could seriously sit at the bar and drink mojitos while eating these peppers all day long. The salt matches perfectly with the spice, which is just enough to warm you up inside, until every now and then you get one of the rare hot ones that really wake you up. I found that mixing these in with the eggs (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026) was a perfect way to enjoy both, as the peppers themselves really benefitted from some other flavors, and the eggs desperately needed that boost of heat.I was pretty well compelled to order the grilled corn (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026) covered in aioli, lime, esplette pepper and aged cheese, not only from all the rave reviews here, but just reading on the menu that leaves you with little option. It is as good as people say, although if I could make one change it would be less aioli and more cheese. The cheese on here is so damn good, and the lime juice cuts through it so smoothly so it doesn't feel too heavy. I also ordered the Medjool dates filled with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese and wrapped in Serrano ham (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026), and although there were only 2 of them to enjoy, it was a nice change of pace to nibble on when I wanted a break from the growing heat of the peppers.My only regret about Toro is that I didn't get to try everything I wanted, which is always a good problem to have if you have to have one. If I ever came back for dinner and got to sample even more of their plates I'm certain this place would earn the last half-star from me and get upgraded to a perfect score.", "Date": "2010-02-23", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Caroline T.", "ReviewID": "FVZgeSffFiw7MuEM9Bek8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just the best.

We did have to wait an hour, but it was WORTH the WAIT. \u00a0All of our tapas selections were amazing and our waiter was awesome too (the service was exemplary at this visit, but mediocre at my first visit). \u00a0On my first visit there I split the paella with a friend so I didn't get to sample many dishes, however, on this visit it was no holds barred. I think we ordered about 6 items and they started arriving at our table almost instantaneously. \u00a0Everything was delicious.The place was absolutely packed at 6pm when we put our name in so we walked down the street and had a drink at Stella. We were sat a little after 7pm and the restaurant cleared out a bit about half way through our meal. \u00a0On this night it appeared that the wait would have been shorter had we showed up around 7:30 or 8pm; but I am not sure if this is a consistent trend for the restaurant. \u00a0If you like tapas and sangria then this place is a must try. \u00a0***Original review*******************Last night I took a friend that used to live in Boston, but now lives in D.C., to this relatively new South End establishment. I am a fan of Ken Oringer's other restaurants and I am now a fan of Toro as well. The hostess was able to seat us right away when we walked in at 7pm. The restaurant was really busy for a Tuesday evening and I considered this a good sign. I was unfamiliar with the red wines available by the glass, but the waitress was able to make a great recommendation. My friend and I ordered two tapas (the house corn dish and the bread covered with olive oil and tomatoes) and then we split the Paella Valenciana. This paella dish contains shrimp, mussels, clams, chorizo, and chicken. \u00a0The kitchen allows you to omit anything you don't care for so we eliminated the sausage. Normally I am not a big fan of seafood dishes like this, but this paella was amazing! I really enjoyed it because the dish was full of flavor but wasn't overly 'fishy'. \u00a0For dessert we ordered the churros with dark chili infused chocolate. My friend and I did not care for the chocolate at all. The chili flavoring made the chocolate taste burnt so we ate the churros sans the chocolate and they were delicious as is. \u00a0I am already looking forward to my next visit to Toro because there are a number of other dishes I am interested in trying.

I kept ordering, and kept ordering, hoping that I somehow kept stumbling on the fluke on the menu. Much to my dismay, I was incredibly disappointed. As I write this, I am home with a wood fire started, and some meat being marinated and am planning to cook. The food was that bad, so much so that I became sick from the signature Corn dish. The corn was a travesty, think 4 pieces of corn, with 10+ tablespoons of butter, and some garlic and cheese mixed in for good measure. I'm not kidding, 10 tablespoons. I tried it and kept eating, waiting for some revelation or taste explosion to come to me. Sadly, none did and it made me sick to my stomach. Next, the highlight of the evening, the foie gras. It was quite good (though it's hard to foul up such a rich protein). I did like the pear and bacon chutney, all in all it was a nice dish. Next, a buffalo wing tapas. Drenched in bbq sauce, uneventful, stay home and cook them yourself. The duck drumsticks weren't bad. I'd eat those again. The rabbit was boring, a mishmash of flavors, and some really heavy tempura fried vegetables on the side. The braised short rib was also too heavy, go to Oleana or Garden at the cellar for this instead. Next, the cocktails, ahh yes, I think the bartender should have his shaker taken away from him. Ugg. The sandida (sic) was a watermelon based drink that had little to no vodka in it, my 110 lb. significant other was convinced it was juice only ($12 juice). I had a patron tequila based drink, highly recommended by the waitress. Whatever the bartender put in there was not intended by God to be mixed together. People, I drink EVERYTHING, I often finish my guests cocktails just because I hate to see good alcohol go down the drain. Well, I did not finish my $12 cocktail here.

Here is what we ordered:Pate de Conejo - Rabbit Pate with pistachios and whole grain mustard. $6.Datiles con Jamon - Dates filled with almonds and blue cheese wrapped with ham. $6.Escalivada Catalana - Roasted Eggplant with onions, peppers, tomatoes, with sherry vinegar and olive oil. $7.Gambas al Ajillo - Grilled Garlic Shrimp. $12.Maiz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija - The famous grilled corn doused with alioli and aged cheese. $6.

Monkfish con Jamon - Serrano ham wrapped monkfish a la plancha with mussels and green chartreuse. $15. Total for all 8 dishes: Approximately $70.The bread was decent, was a good complement to the tapas. The Pate was decently good, the mustard had somewhat of a spiced kick. The Datiles were decent, liked the slight crunch from the almonds. The ham that wrapped around the Datiles was also tasty. The Eggplant was really tasty and I loved the mixture of the vinegar and the olive oil which gave the vegetables a great flavor. The shrimp was also tasty and probably the tastiest shrimp I had in Boston. Very thick and meaty. The sauce was great for me to dip the bread and made the bread tastier. The corn was probably the tastiest corn I have ever eaten in my life, mainly because it was doused with some sort of alioli that made a significant difference in the tasty flavor. The Patatas Bravas had the right amount of seasoning and the right amount of crisp on the outside. Nice and tasty crispiness on the outside, and soft to chew on the inside. The alioli and the spicy tomato sauce made the potatoes almost addicting to eat. The Pollo con Farro was probably one of the most delicious chicken meats I have ever eaten in my life. The chicken was so juicy and had the right amount of softness. The Monkfish dish was excellently tasty, the fish, the ham, and the mussels but I felt that there was little too much sauce. However, it was also a great sauce to dip the bread into and made the bread tastier. I believe the last four dishes I mentioned were probably the best dishes. The first four dishes I mentioned, while they were not the best, they were still tasty and a good choice as well. As for the service, I thought it was just okay nothing too memorable. The hostess was nice enough to give us a small plate of tapas just for waiting for more than 40 minutes for a table, so that was pretty cool and a great reward, making the wait pretty worthwhile. The atmosphere was really loud, mainly because it was a Friday night. After leaving the restaurant, I left with a feeling of fullness, but I still felt light and felt like I could eat some more.

Like up there with the 55 day aged ribeye at David Burke's phenomenal. Anthony Bourdain describes pork fat as ethereal, and he is right. It is the pinnacle flavor for the human palate. This small plate of pork belly was absolutely packed with flavor. I had to put m fork down and close my eyes. It was a personal moment.Also enjoyable were the Cod Fritters, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, The Beef Heart (tasted like lean pastrami), the eggplant, and the Foie Gras. I really didnt see the hype around the Grilled Corn, and agreed with the princess's evaluation: \"It tastes like an ashtray.\"Besides the corn, our least favorites included the Potatoes with Aioli (read: mayonnaise), the shrimp (overcooked), Tuna Belly (basically tasted like canned white albacore), and the Beef Shortrib (just kind of \"meh\"). These items, along with the overhyped grilled corn, deducted one star.The service was great, timing new plates to come out about the time we were finishing those in front of us, and our waiter provided some good suggestions. They also didnt give us a hard time about splitting \u00a0the check among 3 debit cards (I know, Im such a pain in the ass).DEFINITELY worth the wait, whether its an hour or two. The dishes that were good were AMAZING, and the service was helpful but not hovering, which I like. Its definitely a busy place that occupies a small space, so if youre looking for a roomy restaurant where you can spread out, this is not your kinda joint. Its a upper-middle class restaurant where you'll be comfortable in after work shirt & tie, or jeans and a t-shirt. I will definitely return, hopefully in the next few weeks!Now I'm off to sleep to dream about that Pork Belly while my dog gnaws hungrily on the marrow bone I brought home for him!", "Date": "2010-11-04", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Kim T.", "ReviewID": "6nxr-sRyleyq2Oz2ZUWxOw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super overpriced...super long wait...still super yummy!", "Date": "2013-04-04", "Author_Location": "Watertown, MA"}, {"Author": "Lily P.", "ReviewID": "007DBtvnmo-5Jz7kdwlTmQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Live around the corner - BEST food and drink by far.

\u00a0I'm f'in famished, and would like to have the chance to at least eat something before I puke from drinking.Thus began our assault on the menu. \u00a0If you like food, don't ever go to a tapas place on a budget, especially not Toro. \u00a0 I was, however, happily surprised to see the prices for plates range from $4-$15 ($18 for a special or two), so you can keep it reasonable if you try really really really hard and deprive yourself of amazingness.The service was consistently wonderful, and my dazzling, charming boyfriend (holla) pointed out that he loves Tapas because you order a whole ton of food, and then you never know what they're going to bring out next! \u00a0SURPRISE - foie gras. \u00a0SURPRISE - sizzling garlic shrimp. \u00a0 \u00a0Good point, my man.So, without further adieu, the report card:Queso Mahon - totally worth it. \u00a0Little cubes they'll probably bring out first - a great snack to start off the night.Foie Gras - I'd never had it before, but only heard delicious delicious rumors. \u00a0droooooool...Datiles con Jamon - this is quickly turning into one of my favorite dishes to order at a restaurant, and good lord when these are done right...well, see my comment about the after-dinner drink.Gambas de Ajillo - I loooove garlic and I looove shrimp, so put the two together, translate them into spanish, and i'm on it like white on rice. \u00a0These weren't a standout of the night mostly cause I've had them elsewhere and liked them more, but I still enjoyed every moment of eating them.Patatas Bravas - I'd say these were the biggest let down, simply because they're a standard tapas dish and Toro didn't really have a \"take\" on it. \u00a0it was mainly a pile of (well done) crisped potato bites with some aioli. \u00a0while it's a lot of food (and they brought it last, for a reason i don't know), i'd go for something else. \u00a0it doesn't represent Toro well.Honey Comb Tripe - this was a special, and stands out as the only thing I actively didn't like.Boquerones - Not my choice, but I tried one. \u00a0I think I'm just not a fan of them in general, but the bf was in heaven.Maiz Asado - it's like deconstructed creamed corn. \u00a0yummy. \u00a0messy. \u00a0very very messy. \u00a0and if you're like me, don't bother unless you've got dental floss with you. \u00a0but honestly, it's delicious, and basically two full ears of corn so if you're hungry this plate's for you.Pato con Membrillo - oh sweet sweet duck. \u00a0why do you have to be so cute? \u00a0you're so tasty. \u00a0Toro's take is no exception. \u00a0Costilla de Buey - this dish was solid. \u00a0I think it sounds more enticing than it ended up being, but I wouldn't say I was disappointed.I might as well just have typed a book, so I'll say one more thing. \u00a0Skip dessert (though I almost crossed the line and got some churros con chocolate) and just order yourself a mint flip. \u00a0One sip of that and I jizzed in my pants.The End.", "Date": "2009-07-26", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "J K.", "ReviewID": "P5REh-yqtHlKQ2ET8mCPpg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The food was scrumptious - especially the dates and the beef heart, but the corn was can't miss as well.

It terms of flavor, it's easily in the top three, rivaling only the Craigie burger in terms of beefy goodness, it's juicy beyond belief, and ordering the burger \"messy\" just adds to the flavor profile. A \"messy\" burger, for the uninformed, is the same spread used on the to-die-for grilled corn, featuring a blend of garlic alioli, Cotija cheese, lime and espelette pepper. I often find an alioli to be too much, but here it's the perfect compliment to a beefy burger.Pickled red onion adds a nice balance to the richness of the 100% short rib burger, but maybe could have used a bit more acidity, as I wasn't getting quite enough to satisfy my needs. It's a paltry 5 ounce burger, and quite frankly, despite ordering two tapas, I could have easily eaten another burger or two. Which isn't a bad thing, it definitely left me wanting more, and for $8 seems like a relative steal. But you have to factor in that it doesn't come with anything, filling in the blanks with a Tapas or two is up to you, and after all was said and done, for two people we were staring at a $50 bill once again.My biggest gripe is not with the price tag, I can live with that, but it was the lack of effort with the bun and the cheese. The bun is a pretty standard Arnold's white bun from the grocery store, arriving cold and un-toasted, it has little to offer, dissolving into mush almost immediately with the amount of juice coming out of the burger. And while there is a time and place for American cheese, it just doesn't belong here, this burger deserves better. The Cotija failed to deliver in the alioli, and the un-melted American does the same. I feel like a strong Cheddar or a Manchego really would have fit the bill and put the Toro burger onto another level. It is tricky to get the burger, as it's only available during weekday lunch hours, but in terms of the beefiness that I've been searching for, it's certainly one of the two best tasting burgers I've had in Boston to date, just imagine what a better bun would do?", "Date": "2010-07-04", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "erica c.", "ReviewID": "CQH3umWze8AFe8YNHcqvOg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Toro toro!

We sat at the communal table in the center of the small restaurant. Service was prompt and the food came out kind of quick despite the restaurant being full.We ordered the white and red sangria. I personally liked the red. The white had lychee in it, but I thought the lychee kind of overpowered the drink. Out of 12 plates, only a few were good enough for me to have seconds of. The others were good but the flavors didn't wow me. The Ma\u00edz Asado con Alioli y Queso Cotija \u00a0(Grilled corn with alioli, lime, espelette pepper and aged cheese) was good but I think it could've used some more kick. It they used sweet corn, I think it would've tasted better. Maybe a stronger cheese? Don't get me wrong, it was good but I've had better. The Asado de Huesos (Roasted bone marrow with radish citrus salad and oxtail marmalade) was good. It was my first time eating bone marrow. The texture reminded me of foie gras. My favorite was the Costilla de Buey (Rioja braised short rib of beef with armagnac soaked prunes and pommes puree). The prune was key for that dish. They only offer churros for dessert but it was so disappointing. It was undercooked so the insides were mushy and floury tasting.

I was less impressed, I have to say, with some over-seasoned Brussels sprouts and a very fatty pork rib. Wine: we had a glass of house Tempranillo in small bar glasses to start. It was light and serviceable, but I decided we needed to order a full bottle to get my kind of stemware so we splurged on 2008 Phincalalli (a quick online search shows a 41 euro price in Spain and we paid $140). Good stuff -- spicy Rioja excellent with food at restaurant.

The sweetbreads were definitely a favorite along with the Empanadas and the serrano ham. At this point, I'm sad to say that while I remember being very happy with the food and wine I cannot remember the actual dishes as the rest of the scene overwhelms my memory for better or worse. I would definitely recommend the place again based on just the food and the sangria, but..The Bad:It took us forever to get seated. We didn't have a reservation, fair enough. But when the hostesses start playing good hostess/bitchy hostess with you, you've been standing around too long. We asked for first available inside or outside and were originally told 45 minutes which stretched out to an hour and a half with most our interactions unfortunately coming with the bitchy hostess. After more than an hour, the \"good\" hostess brought us some complimentary appetizers. Yet made it seem like it was compliments of the chef and something she was doing for everyone not because we had been standing around waiting for a table that seemed like it was never going to come. We managed to go through an entire carafe of (yummy!) sangria in the time we were waiting with just the two of us. The bar area was packed like teen girls at a Jonas Brother's concert. At one point I felt I was crowd surfing in order to get our sangria from the bar. Alas, dear hostess, do you just not know how busy you are to give people a real estimate of how long they're going to have to wait around? Or are you just too cool to really care about managing your customers expectations? Its proven that if you manage expectations customer service is a breeze. You tell me 2 hours and I wait 1, I'll be grateful. You tell me 45 minutes and I wait 46, I'm gonna be pissed. Simple math.The Ugly:This place is filled with douchebags and skinny chicks with big heads hanging on their boney bodies. It was infuriating and sad at the same time. Infuriating to listen to dumbass guys \"ironically\" drinking PBR at a really nice restaurant talk about douche-y things EXTREMELY LOUDLY RIGHT NEXT TO YOU and sad to see malnourished women feign caring at anything the douchebag has to say why eyeing a plate of Morcilla like a man stranded on a desert island eyes water.

A little bland, or you could call this dish refreshing. Nothing special, yet again.- Omelette - the 1 bite wonder. Honestly, it's an omelette with potato in it. SIGH. Did I really just drop $5 on a bite of egg? - Grilled shrimp - Probably the BEST dish we tried. I loved the large, perfectly grilled shrimps! Full of flavor and swimming in a wonderfully creamy sauce. I'd eat this every day if I could! - Churros - Probably highlight of the meal.

We had the several cold and several hot tapas dishes.The cold dishes we had were fresh white anchovies (wow!), the eggplant dish (very good, though somewhat \"familiar\") and the tuna bellies (again - very good, just not 'distinct enough' as compared to canned tuna).The hot dishes included the corn everyone is talking about (and for a good reason - the most unique corn dish I have every had) and the chicken empanadas (that had a very enjoyable crunch and came is a very good lentil pure that was surprisingly light and refreshing). Both had an aioli base that in our mind really hit the spot.For desert we took the choros. We have had choros before - both in Barcelona and Madrid. These were better.The service was very polite and many times unnoticeable (which I think is a big plus).The bad: The only reason I did not give 'Toro\" 5 stars is the atmosphere. It was not bad. I liked the crowded seating and the long-shared tables. I just disliked the very dark room (I think food like this should be given light to enjoy it better) and the noise level (I would prefer a more mellow, 1960's-esk atmosphere for this food).", "Date": "2012-12-27", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Azatuhi A.", "ReviewID": "FQFyKbq-VIfQEgHMvBVFSA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Incredible food.

Not expecting a restaurant to be very crowded at noon on a Friday, we didn't even try to make a reservation. We were in for a surprise.

The highlights here are the tapas. We had a \u00a0plate of shrimp in a sauce that was so delicious several people used the bread for the table to mop up the last bits of sauce on the serving plate. I also enjoyed their salads. The vegetarian option, with a nice bit of cheese in it was delicious. The Atun salad was also good with large pieces of high grade tuna. Others in our party feasted on the bone marrow and enjoyed it greatly. IMO, the cheese plate was not that fabulous. The cheese could be better quality and more varied. There was too much of an emphasis on Manchego and manchego-like (hard) cheeses. Service was better than I expected with our server bringing us fresh silverware for different courses. He also replenished our bread basket without us having to ask. Prices are reasonable, especially if you are coming with a large group and can order a lot and try everything. The atmosphere is a bit crowded and noisy so if you're looking for a quiet time out, look elsewhere. Also, I agree with others below. Do not order to corn dish on a date.

Uhm I am confused. \u00a0Can anyone shed light onto this for me? \u00a0When she came back, we asked if we could slide down one seat each so we weren't sitting elbow-to-elbow with the couple next to us. \u00a0She said that was fine, but then we had to be out by 7 because those two specific seats were reserved for 7:00, whereas the ones she'd given us were free til 7:30. \u00a0Again, I am entirely confused as to what really went on in this exchange, because her explanations made no sense to me.However, the waitress came over and was pleasant and adorable and told us to take our time and enjoy our dinner and conversation, as there was no rush to get us out. \u00a0Thank you, adorable, curly-haired blond waitress. \u00a0you are delightful.We got a nice red wine and, with the help of the waitress, tried a few new items and a few old go-tos.Here's a quick run-down:Uni sandwich - The bread was grilled such that it was crunchy on the outside and soft inside, which was great, but the uni itself tasted salty and one-note. \u00a0Didn't have a lot of depth in flavor, and the highlight really was the breadtuna tartare - \u00a0The tuna itself, though not bright red (a little pinker, making me think that it was fattier and less lean than I am used to at sushi places, but that's just a guess), was tasty, but it came in a dish covered in this lime-y foam which was off-putting just because there was so much of it and it drowned out the taste of the tuna and made every bite taste like, well, lime foam.Cod fritters - Always pretty decent, these fell short tonight. \u00a0Again, perhaps because of RW, but the onion rings weren't as crunchy as normal, and the fritters were a bit dry. \u00a0The puree they're served with was spot-on, as always.grilled corn - Again, perfect. \u00a0There's a reason this is the signature dishcured ham (the acorn-fed pig that looked a bit like prosciutto) - Came sliced thin and laid out on a wooden board...had a bit more fat around each slice than prosciutto, and the waitress told us that pigs really like eating acorns and it makes their meat taste nuttier. \u00a0Hm. \u00a0Little fun-fact.pork belly - I am not very familiar with the traditional texture of pork belly, but this one was rubbery and REALLY hard to cut through. \u00a0It looks like it'd be spongy to cut but in reality, it was really rubbery and tough with the butter knife...not just to get through the golden crust, but the whole way through. \u00a0But again, i'm not the pork belly expertgarlic shrimp - Very tasty, shrimp popped in your mouth due to perfect doneness, and we sopped up every last bit of sauce with bread. \u00a0churros - tasty and light, these are served with an orange chocolate sauce and they create the perfect end to a meal.I would say the experience tonight was 3 stars, the food quality may have suffered because of RW, but the restaurant itself to me is still a solid 4. \u00a0I'd go back, yes, but perhaps avoid RW next time.", "Date": "2010-03-23", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Nicole M.", "ReviewID": "hLmwCJQlonyto4_9U-P_6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sybil.There's not much I can say about Toro that hasn't already been said. \u00a0Except the place apparently makes me go to one of my other personalities. \u00a0The personality that eats things I would NEVER otherwise consider putting anywhere near my mouth.I'm not a carnivore, nor am I a vegetarian. \u00a0I eat chicken. \u00a0I eat turkey. \u00a0I do not eat deli meat. \u00a0I do not eat pork or beef. \u00a0I eat fish, but usually only white fish.

Remember when said I didn't eat meat? This rioja braised short rib dish had incredible flavor. Incredible! \u00a0I wanted the Pan con Tomate, but given the other stuff we got, it didn't make the cut. \u00a0I also heard the Coliflor a la Plancha was good, but we had already unbuttoned our jeans and practically rolled out of there. Next time.What we didn't order that we tried were our neighbors' Mejillones con Sidra. \u00a0I DON'T EAT SHELLFISH! \u00a0But I tried the mussels. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0They were pretty damn tasty. \u00a0And the hubbs said they may have been his favorite dish of the night. \u00a0HE doesn't eat them either. \u00a0If that tells you anything.Between my adventure of trying both the beef and the mussels, the hubbs said he was getting all hot for me. \u00a0Take a cold shower buddy! \u00a0We were having too much fun. \u00a0I mentioned our neighbors a couple times. \u00a0The big community table is fantastic for meeting fun new people. \u00a0And sharing dishes. \u00a0And apparently perrons of cava. \u00a0We passed meals and the perron back and forth all night long. \u00a0Gotta love a place where you're sharing travel stories with and getting drunk with and finding 'small world' things to discover with your tablemates.Good times.", "Date": "2010-04-05", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "William M.", "ReviewID": "Pc-nZCFqm1QH4KtxsqH_nw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our friend MA Carlson had heard about this place for forever, so when we were together...got there just before they started serving food, there were some folks at the bar and a couple of tables had folks, but the place was empty.

One bus-girl took my plate of bread away before I was even done. They definitely try to rush you out of here, so they can turn the tables over faster. Food comes out pretty quickly. I know it's tapas, but the portions are even smaller than small. The prices aren't really worth it either. We paid 4 dollars for two tiny pieces of toasted bread smothered in garlic and tomatoes.... i coulda made this better. --The fois gras was really good.--The mussel dish, literally came with two tiny pieces of baguette and four oysters for 12 dollars. WOWWW is all i can say. --The corn was glazed in layers and layers of cheese and butter. My entire gym workout went down the drain with one bite of that corn. --We also ordered the oysters, which were prepared for us with a vinegar sauce and champagne. I did not like it at all.

The churros are perfect as far as I'm concerned: crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the chocolate sauce isn't too sweet. \u00a0And of course, I always share a pitcher of red sangria.If I were you, I'd come here for the corn alone (or run over to La Verdad if you're in Fenway, it's on the menu there, too). \u00a0But definitely make an appearance at some point, I'm sure you'll agree that it's worth it.", "Date": "2009-04-18", "Author_Location": "Alexandria, VA"}, {"Author": "Mark W.", "ReviewID": "WD0H1OIdfS9eNw3K3Rp9zQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We use to live right down the street from Toro's in the South End.

So I had foie gras, sweetbreads, buffalo heart and pork belly meals. Each was more amazing than the next. The only thing I ordered that I didn't like were the razor clams. The restaurant was kind enough to take them off of my bill even though nothing was wrong with them (it was just my personal taste)The sweetbreads were served kung pow style, which I thought was actually more general tsao style. Either way, it was amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys tapas, great drinks, and trying new things. That said there are plenty of vegetarian options and non-interesting options for those who are less adventurous. The restaurant is located on a main street in a re-gentrified section of South Boston.

The kitchen wasnt open yet, so we were able to grab a couple drinks at the bar. Wait...let me rephrase that...we got a pitcher of sangria! Shortly after, the kitchen opened and they sat us at a little table. One concern was how small the tables were, especialy with getting tapas and having multiple plates. BUt it worked out fine, and it went well with the ambience. We started with the Kobe burgers which were FAB-freakin-tabulous! Two itsy bitsy kobe burgers that just melt in our mouth. We then ordered a half order of the paella. It was also really great! The seafood was fresh and delicious. We really took our time with the sangria and food, and actually were full after that. (A full order of the paella would be really big!) And plus, now we have another reason to go back again, so we can try out more dishes!Our server was Kelly. She was really chill and easy going, which we really enjoyed. Especially in that kinda of restaurant. The bussers though were a different story! I was thiiiis close to yelling at the chick and telling her we werent finished, we werent close to being finished, we didnt want the plates to be taken, and leave us alone!!!

I highly recommend sharing , so that you can get to try as many dishes as possible. First off I really liked the atmosphere.

I've heard that there can be lines up to two hours, so be prepared and come early.They have a fairly large menu, with lots of options with meats like steak and fish, or more bazaar things like tripe, buffalo tongue, and buffalo heart. There \u00a0are two sections of tapas Tapas Frias (cold), and tapas caliente (hot). They also have appetizers, and more standard entrees. One of my favorite dishes was the shrimp tapa.

I also had the kabayaki glazed short ribs. the beef was SOO tender, and the gaze gave it a nice tangy, sweet taste.

I was able to observe the front tables eating bread with pate, and at another table, saw a paella eaten. \u00a0 \u00a0The atmosphere was great, definably a \"romantic spot\" but with people talking, drinking and eating, and generally being merry, and not at all pretentious. They played mostly hipster rock folky music but they were all good song choices....nothing annoying. Stuff like Peter Bjorn and John and Gotye. Overall, I give it a 10/10. We opted to go alcohol free for dinner, but the selection of beverages was great and I made a note to have a caparehna next time or try some of their wine-on-tap. We decided on splitting half of a Valenciana Paella with shrimp, mussels, clams, chorizo, chicken, and calasparra rica. I love all those ingredients. Also, we chose the Panza De Cerdo \u00a0crispy pork belly with little neck clams, smoked potatoes and celery oyster crackers., and for full-on decadence since Jillian has never had it, a Foie Gras con Duranzos with peach walnut mostarada. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Our server was or resembled Michael Glabicki of Rusted Root and we had to resist the urge to ask him if this is what he did when not touring. I figured we would find out on August 24th when we saw them play New York. He was a nice guy and brought us out the Foie Gras and Panza De Cerdo crispy pork belly at once. They were both orgasmic. It is hard to beat Jeremy Kean of Whisk's pork belly which is IMO the best in the city, but this at least matched it which is all I was looking for.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The pork belly was so good. The clams were mouth watering, and the celery oyster crackers and potatoes were some of the best I have ever had. We used the bread to soak up the last pieces of the clam chowder. \u00a0 The Foie Gras was decadent and delicious. I had a particular satisfaction out of feeding my lovely girlfriend her first bites of foie gras, and was impressed that she never wavered even when I reminded her what foie gras actually was.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The paella was so good to every bite. The clams good, the mussels even better and the shrimp succulent. The rice tasted healthy and reminded me of quinoa. Half of the Valencia paella was enough for two people and we used the rest of the bread to soak up the remaining liquid. \u00a0Many thanks to Jillian,this review came together because she emailed me the photos we took from the previous evening.

We started with a few drinks while we waited: the Papa Gallo and Verdad y Amor. I'm not a fan of tequila but they were both delicious! The atmosphere was great! Their playlist was pretty damn good: hip hop, R&B and some soul. After a couple had finished their dinner we were able to take their seats at the bar, which we were happy about because Luis was so accommodating! We looked around and saw that the corn was a popular item, took a look at the menu and ended up asking Luis for recommendations. Best thing we could've done considering there were so many dishes to choose from! I loved that this is tapas style food so we were able to order a little bit of everything.Luis started us off with the grilled corn: what can I say about this dish that you haven't already read about? They were finger-lickin good!! We then had the garlic shrimp and I can't say enough about the rich flavor! The Ostras en Escabeche were so damn good we had to have two orders! We love oysters and eat them whenever we get a chance; this is nothing like we've ever had before! For our main dish we had the paella Valenciana. We had to share a half order and this was plenty! It was really good!!As if we hadn't had enough food (and drinks) Luis ordered an item off the menu for us. It was pork in a curry sauce. It was so tender and lean!

I knew what we were signing up for when we decided to eat at the bar but, they really need to regulate crowd. I am used to crowed bars but this was excessive forget about fire code there were people presed up aginst me for the entire 1.5 hours we were in there.

Jamon Serrano Redondo Iglesias (Premium cured Spanish ham) - tasty, salty and buttery perfection; I liked this more than the Iowa raised acorn ham, which is less salty. The dish came on a wooden board as 13 generous, thin-cut slices.2. Yellowfin tuna with white soy, spicy cucumbers, citrus and avocado - make sure you ask if this is the sliced one served sashimi style because I once accidentally ordered one of the other tuna dishes and was disappointed to get ceviche (it was good too, but not the same level). There are four slices. It's so refreshing and so delicious that I actually resent the fact I have to share, and I am always secretly wishing the table \u00a0would order more. 3. Medjool dates filled with Marcona almonds and Cabrales blue cheese, wrapped in Jamon Serrano - this small dish comes with two big dates. Yes, this is one of those dishes where you can easily eat it entirely by yourself and still crave more.4. Grilled corn with alioli - this is excellent and a favorite of the crowd. We definitely enjoyed it more after we asked them to cut the corn off the cob for us.These were ok, but I wouldn't order again without trying the rest of the menu first:Hunter's style braised beef short ribs - this was like a beef stew. I thought this was bland.Brussel sprouts - roasted and well-prepared without any bitterness; but you have to like brussel sprouts. They were not different from any other restaurant that knows how to prepare these well.I learned I am not a big fan of paella. We had the special with pig and bone marrow. It tasted ok and the half-portion was good for four people, but for the price, I think I would have preferred to order other dishes.They only have one dessert which are churros with chocolate for $7. They give you 3 medium pieces. They are the highest quality churros I've ever had.

Food is excellent, though overall many of the dishes seem more tapas-inspired to me. You will generally not mistake these for being authentic Spain-style tapas. They end up being more like small Spanish-influenced american restaurant-style dishes (not at all a bad thing). Mainstays for me are the pimientos de padr\u00f3n (this is a distinct exception to the above comment - these are totally authentic and in fact hard to find in Boston, or in tapas places in many cities in general - if I am eating at toro, these are absolutely on the table), pan con tomate (with the anchoas, if I have my way) and patatas bravas (I go back and forth on whether or not I like how they plate the patatas on top of the brava sauce and alioli instead of coating them evenly). The Brussels sprouts are rad, when they're on the menu. The maiz asado is well known to be their signature dish - it is delicious and is a must-try for your first time there - but it is incredibly messy to eat (fun if you're in the mood). Nearly anything you order here is going to be good, so don't stress too much.Cocktails are very good as is the beer and wine selection. The garnacha is a good value relative to some of their other reds. Last time I went they didn't have the caramelized caipirinha available, hopefully thats just temporary. they also have calimocho on the drink menu, which is fun to see, but for what they charge for one glass you should just get your own bottle of cheap red and liter of coca-cola and get way more bang for your buck. (don't knock it til you've tried it - great summer drink in the park)The ambiance for dinner is small, dark, cramped, and noisy - in a sort of ideal way. It's constantly slammed and they don't take reservations, so if you are showing up after 6pm be prepared to wait. Try not to come here with more than 4 people for dinner. Outdoor seating sometimes frees up a little more quickly. Lunch is way more chill and most of the menu is the same.

The waiter kind of rushes you along and the people who bring out the food know nothing about what they are bringing out. They have no idea who ordered it.

What are you doing to me?!? This is a long review so I will summarize my experience first:Slow to seat us, quick to get us in and out, and turn the table over. Makes you wonder if they even want you there.Kind of over-priced, but EXCELLENT food with terrible service somehow averages to 3 stars. I went to Toro with a friend on a friday night completely forwarned and prepared for an hour wait. We even had a game plan: Go in, put name down at 6pm. Walk to Flour, have coffee, come back, eat amazing dinner.We did exactly that. 6pm - We put our name down at we were told yeah, an hour-ish wait. The place was packed. Made sense. Had some coffee and pre-dinner conversation at Flour. 7:15 -We called into the restaurant and were told the table they had for us was either just eating or just paying for dessert. So we linger a little longer and then head to the restaurant expected to be seated soon. 7:30- Show up at restaurant and are told by the hosts that the people at our table have finished eating and paid, and are just talking. Which I guess I can relate if you're just having a fun dinner with friends. Sometimes you just lose track of time and you're talking and having a good time. However, this means my friends and I are standing awkwardly half in the doorway of Toro (because there's def no room in this place). We're just making this awkward road block for anyone trying to get in or out of the restaurant, or to and from some corner tables. Only because there's no room for us anywhere else.7:45 - Still waiting, awkwardly by the host stand. Our table is apparently still chit chatting. I don't know or think our waiter or host has made any attempt at getting them out. I'm also wondering why the hell our group was assigned a specific table and not just: the next table available with 4 seats.8:05 - Success! Finally seated after a whopping 2 hour wait!The food was great - we had the mussels, tortilla espagnola, beef bone marrow, tuna tartare, beef short rib, duck with quince paste and the corn. The only thing i would definitely not recommend is the duck. Tuna was so-so. Corn, bone marrow, and beef short rib all amazing.Now, I feel like after a hard fought 2 hour battle to get our table, maybe we could have a relaxing dinner ourselves. In our 2 hour wait my dinner companions and I even discussed the European vs American practice of bringing the check and how my friend from Mexico had to really learn to not be horrifically offended when people bring the check before she's asked for it. \u00a0But this is what I have to say about the service:It was efficient. The server came up to us almost immediately and asked for drink orders and then again food orders. The pace was hurried, but the place was so packed it was understandable. However, when we were finishing up our food we were down to some empty serving plates (that once had the tuna or bone marrow on it) and some plates that still had food on it (like the duck plate). One of us was still eating, one of us went to use the restroom, another one was done and i was still picking at the duck here and there. This woman comes, points to an empty plate (maybe the tuna plate) and asks if we're done. I say yes, and she goes on to take away the tuna plate, the bone marrow plate, tries to take the duck plate - but i stop her because it still has food on it! Takes the bread plate (which still had bread on it) and then takes all of our personal plates. I don't know what she was expecting us to do - eat the duck off the serving plate? With one person at the table still eating it seemed incredibly rude to clear off the table to that extent. (I kind of wanted to finish the duck.)Sorry this was a long review, but I guess I'm just trying to convey the ambiance of this restaurant: Crowded, slow to seat you, quick to get you in and out and turn the table over. The food was good, and maybe I'll try them again, but wow I feel a little raw for having not confronted a manager about this whole situation when it happened. Also, the place was so dark and seemed like it was getting progressively darker and darker, like going blind. It just has to be one of the dimmest restaurants ive even been in.It would be a good idea to pop in, put your name in, go watch a movie, come back.", "Date": "2011-04-09", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Stephanie L.", "ReviewID": "85FZcttyo_8T2k7TzGJUpw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "amazing meal! my boyfriend and I went here last night and the staff was friendly and we sat at the bar with little wait.

Everything we ordered was perfection- tortilla espanola, empanada de pollo, filete a la plancha, patatas bravas, and maiz asado (tortilla, chicken, steak, potatoes and corn). I guess they are famous for the corn, because I was told by friends who had been there before that I had to order the corn and when we walked in I think it was on almost every table. The hype was not a let down and I would tell anyone going they must order the corn as well. We both had the tinto de verano to drink, which was delicious and took me back to my Spain days. Toro is kind-of small and the tables are very close together, but it has a nice, trendy feel to it. The ambiance is dark and cozy, with dark wood and a nice bar in the back. The service was great and it was packed.

Well, there was apparently a line to get in cause the place was already packed and we were told 1-2 hours. After about an hour and fifteen we were seated. We tried enough food to feed a small third world country because the menu has to have over a hundred items and the waitress told us most people order 3 plates each. Ok then. From what I remember having awakened from my food coma, both of the paellas we ordered, the seafood one and the Brambly Farms pulled pork one were fantastic. Warning. I started out getting a full order of each as the menu says they are for two people but the HALF order is for two people and was plenty. I can't even imagine what a full order must be. From the tapas we ordered, the standout was the tuna tartare. I never even considered trying it but after being all but force fed a sample, I would totally order that again. The goat cheese with honey tomato was also great but far FAR too rich for one person, tapas size or not. Braised short ribs were a little sweet for me. The corn was OK but having read the glowing reviews of it, was a little disappointed. They were too cheesy and must have been sitting for a while cause they were cold. The absolute let down were the duck drumsticks. Uhh, yuck. ??? They were very dry and ultra sweet. Don't bother with those IMO. Also, we got the churos for dessert. Nothing to write home about.

We all know that the space is the size of a pin head--and that's doing it justice. We know all of this, but we don't care. We've heard the food is out of this world, so we must try it.

Thankfully, one girl knew a girl who knew the owner, yada, yada, and we were able to secure a \"hush-hush\" reservation. We were scooted in in under 15 minutes. That's dope y'all, because when the people that came in directly behind us asked about the wait, they were told TWO HOURS! I don't know about you, but no food on earth is worth that wait.

The first time there but definately not the last. Upon entering, you'll notice that the place is very small and can seem overly crowded, especially if you're standing at the bar waiting for your table. I found this to be a negative. The restaurant has a great eclectic ambience though. (positive). Toro does not take reservations for dinner (negative). Our party of four had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Not bad at all, however it was a Monday night. I cringe thinking of what the wait would be like on a Friday or Saturday night. Once seated, I had a somewhat difficult time reading the menu due to the dim lighting (negative). My friends and I ordered our first round of tapas, which where delivered to our table promptly by the efficient and polite wait staff (positive). Once I started sampling the delectable dishes, all negatives were negated. The food is fantastic and it's a wonderful way to experiment with new foods and flavors! Portions are small but they're cheaper than a full priced entree or appetizer so it's a great way to sample new tastes. Many times I've perused a menu and thought \"I'd like to try that but don't want to pay that much for something I may not like.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We sampled the braised beef short ribs with bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions......smoked pork bellies.....marinated olives.......mussels with garlic confit, fennel and sherry vinegar.....beef heart.......smoked eggplant with onions, peppers, tomatoes, sherry vinegar and olive oil.....garlic shrimp....grilled corn with alioli, lime and aged cheese (the unanimous favorite!!).....sushi tuna with fermented black beans and ginger...sweetbreads. We then ordered the large paella valencia which had a nice proportion of mussels, clams, chicken and chorizo sausage.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since the portions are so small, this is a great place to be adventuresome and sample new foods. I tried both the sweetbreads (thymus gland) and beef heart.

Our waitress constantly checked on them while only checked on my table once. I am not someone who need tons of attention but offering to refill water for her \"regular\" who sits next to us and completely ignoring our empty glasses were quite unacceptable. Thanks to the awesome runner. She filled our water for us when she checked on our table. The \"regular\" also get their check immediately while we hv to wait abt 5 mins although we asked for the check the same time. As far as I know, I pay the same price as the \"regular\".

Highlights for me were the gambas al ajillo, the chicken empanadas, the salt cod (OMG!, amazing) and the beet salad. Seafood is a specialty I guess, there's a great variety of it on the menu. We went for the second cheapest bottle of wine and enjoyed it thoroughly. I wasn't blown away by the dessert, sort of a Spanish pate a choux with spicy chocolate sauce, but it, like everything else, was beautifully prepared. The service was fast, and very friendly and professional. No doubt the place was crowded on a Monday night because of Restaurant Week, but I was impressed that it was jammed.

But, when I got there a lot of the people seemed to be enjoying it, so, I gave it a chance. It was very, very crowded and noisy. And it took about 40 minutes for us to get seated, and this was on a slow day. They serve complimentary bread. The first piece I had wasn't a pleasant taste. It tasted, stale, and it was cold. But the next piece was better. I decided to order the Hummus platter. The Hummus was A-MA-ZING!!!!!! It wasn't the average hummus. It tasted sort of smooth on my tongue. Then we ordered the corn. It was supposedly very, very popular and yummy. The evidence was that everyone at the long table had ordered it and shared it with the people they were with. When my family ordered it, I didn't want to try it because of the feta cheese and creamy butter on it. So, I removed the feta cheese and tried it. It was pretty good. The taste was different, but, I came around to like it sooner than I realized. For dessert I ordered the churros. They were to die for. There was a hot chocolate sauce to dip them in and at the end I just drank the sauce. I do think the service was terrific. The waiters were attentive and nice. I do think Toro was a risk worth taking. And in the end, as I thought about it, I realized I did, actually like it. Though they could get a bigger place.
