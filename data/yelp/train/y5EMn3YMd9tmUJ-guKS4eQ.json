That has now been rectified.So in my Longman & Eagle review, I noted that L&E reminded me of Austin's Barley Swine, one of the best meals from the American (New), trendy-casual, no reservations, you'll wait and you'll like it school of restaurantery. Well, if I could combine L&E's gastronomically heightened food with Avec's uber-communal environment, you'd get Barley Swine to a T.Avec is close-quarters dining, a long stretch of eight-tops plus elevated bar seating, where you're squashed next to a fellow diner whether you know him or her or not. That means you get to be envious of their food and-or conversation and-or dining companion, unless you ordered better or are especially loquacious or brought a smokin' hottie. So if that's your bag, you'll dig Avec.If food is your primary reason for racking up dining rewards points on your credit card, then Avec has you covered too. It's more traditional--whatever that means when it's a Basque restaurant in Chicago--than innovative, but it's unmistakably delicious.The wife and I went with three dishes, though I surely could have ordered more based on description alone, if not for the cost and the stomach real estate. We started with the brandade, a delightfully creamy and delicious dish, and sort of an amalgam of the creaminess of Robuchon's mashed potatoes and the buttery fattiness of Le Comptoir's crazy good bone marrow. Yes, I just dropped Paris references, and now I hate myself for food snobbery.Our next dish, the summer squash, was a flavor-texture mishmash medley--smokiness from the charred squash, creaminess from the feta, spiciness from the shishito pepper (yes, I landed the coveted one in ten), crispy sweetness from the nuts, mintiness from the...mint. It's a fantastic summertime vegetarian dish.We ended with the way too big paella. My wife was very hesitant as it comes with snail boudin, while I fancied how the sausages were sneakily shaped as large escargot. My take is that it was boudin blanc, but I can't fully verify. The paella's chicken was hit-or-miss, as some parts were tasty while others dry. I really enjoyed the charred rice, while my wife liked the fluffy, saucy parts. That got along amiably with the dish.By then, we were too full for dessert or anything else. If anything, a party of four would have been perfect for small plates sharing, so long as you get to Avec at an unreasonable hour in order to avoid an unreasonable wait.

there is no reason to even both reviewing these given the others' praise. \u00a0Get them. \u00a0In fact, consider getting them again, for dessert... \u00a0they're that good.The foccacia - this was a surprise. \u00a0Definitely one of the more unique plates I've had (warning, it's a lot of food for just bread/cheese), and I found it to be an incredible accompaniment to the two bottles of wine we went with (both rose's for once on a whim - both reasonably priced).The fish - this is one of the best whole fish preparations I've ever had. \u00a0The fish itself wasn't greasy at all and it had a great accompaniment of greens that balanced it well.At no point during the entire meal did we feel rushed. \u00a0In fact, after ordering dessert (cobbler - which was also good), we ended up ordering coffee and a second round of dessert (nutter butters - which were some of the best small bites I've ever had for a dessert).Overall, for the quality of the food, the atmosphere and the service, I couldn't believe how reasonable our bill was at the end of the meal. \u00a0There are very few restaurants I frequent more than once a year... \u00a0this may be one of them.", "Date": "2014-07-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Randy F.", "ReviewID": "7gxjw5_breKpbDHnQ1hWCg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Avec and Au Cheval are nearby restaurants with similar popularity, similar styles of taking no advance reservations, and fantastic food. \u00a0We were dropped off at Randolph Street and smartly put our names down for both hotspots. \u00a0Even on a weekday night, both places were packed with people and had lines out the door. \u00a0Lucky for us, our wait at Avec was totally doable. \u00a0At an estimated time of 40 minutes, the wait was really under 30 minutes and we soon found ourselves sitting and hungry among a communal table of other passionate diners. \u00a0The atmosphere (to me) is very reminiscent of NYC's \u00a0Momofuku Ssam Bar. \u00a0A long narrow restaurant lined with communal tables on one side and bar seating on the other. \u00a0It gets loud and crowded inside and expect to sit close to fellow patrons as well as overhear conversations. \u00a0Nice thing is that the wait staff are efficient and quick with both recommendations and orders and totally expert at navigating through the tight spaces and keeping all the dinner parties separate among each table. \u00a0Our selection:Chorizo stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce - $12. \u00a0Their signature appetizer and brought to the table very quickly. \u00a0They must sell a ton of this order and for good reason. \u00a0It's absolutely delicious. \u00a0A true explosion of flavor from the salty chorizo sausage to the sweet medjool dates to the smokiness of the bacon. \u00a0It's all brought together by the mildly spicy pepper-tomato sauce that I poured on top of each piece. \u00a0Order this.Spiced Lebnah Cheese with Roasted Apricots, Cilantro, Green Almonds, and Flatbread - $14. \u00a0A very flavorful cheese that is mixed with a wonderful salad of apricots, cilantro, and almonds. \u00a0It's a very Mediterranean dish and has those signature flavors. \u00a0Hand Cut Pappardelle Pasta with Mushroom Bolognese, Madeira, and Crescenza Cheese - $18. \u00a0Super fresh pasta cooked perfectly al dente. \u00a0The mushroom sauce is amazing as is the piece of soft cheese on top. \u00a0A wonderful dish.Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder with Pocha Beans, Cider Braised Chorizo, and Clams - $24. \u00a0We actually ordered the wood oven paella, but they accidentally brought this instead. \u00a0I didn't say anything as I had been eyeing the clams and pork shoulder dish of a nearby dining patron and actually wanted to try some. \u00a0It's great. \u00a0The pork shoulder is super tender. \u00a0The clams are flavorful and well seasoned. \u00a0You mix the thing together and the beans and sausage just add to the mix. \u00a0It's almost TOO flavorful. \u00a0I almost wish I had some white rice to pair with it. \u00a0But very good. \u00a0A very generous portion too. \u00a0We couldn't finish it.Overall, we had a great meal at Avec. \u00a0Top notch drinks and some very great food. \u00a0The waitresses recommendations of how many dishes to order was spot on and the tapas style allows the sampling of many different flavors. \u00a0If there was one criticism, it's that I personally found the communal table and loudness much but I can see how the trendy crowd loves it. \u00a0As for the inability to make reservations, with advance planning, it wasn't too much an issue, even at a prime dining hour. \u00a0Avec takes credit cards, including American Express.", "Date": "2014-06-27", "Author_Location": "Palo Alto, CA"}, {"Author": "Lynette H.", "ReviewID": "RrtURrfAFSIsijX-1M1r8g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is amazing.

I ordered the breakfast paella and it was enough to feed me and a small family. Definitely share it.

Hindsight is 20/20, they say.When I walked in, the space was bustling, but the entire space was pretty small. The counter seating is first come-first serve, so if you're a lone diner like myself, it works out perfectly. I cheerfully sat at the counter.Aesthetically, it has the wall-to-wall wood paneled modern look, except that because of its small size and shape, it was like being in a wooden shoebox. I watched the folks behind the counter squeeze by each other and was amazed they could get by. The first 5 min of service was friendly, and then POOF nothing after. I had plates picked up by expediters; that's it.To drink, I had a Royal Jamaican Ginger Beer and started with the oil poached tuna salad, capped with a beautiful halved soft-cooked egg. The salt from the olives were great, the dressing creamy without soaking the leaves....then my main arrived. I had the papparadelle pasta with a mushroom (vegetarian) bolognese. The sauce was amazing; the mushrooms were tender, but the sauce was not like bolognese. Again, it was really good, but the description...The pasta was very thick and doughy. I was tempted to ask for bread just so I could enjoy the sauce and bypass the pasta altogether, but my server was non-existent yet he continued to provide service to others around me (?)There is so much good food in Chicago, I'm sure I won't be back, but check it out for yourself; I may have been in on an off day.", "Date": "2014-06-22", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Dina D.", "ReviewID": "K4Mmm9AJ_Z8aGcIMYNH62A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Avec is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at, ever. As long as you know its quirks before you go, you'll be fine.The 1st quirk: No reservations accepted. Not a big deal, they will text you when the table is ready. There are plenty of places outside the restaurant to poke around in...like for instance their sister restaurant Blackbird next door, where we went for an appetizer while we waited.The 2nd quirk: You will sit elbow to elbow with strangers. The counter is like any other counter, so you expect that. But the main tables are long throwbacks to my elementary school days, seating about 6. There are no smaller tables, and they'll fill every seat. But it's a great way to indulge your food voyeur habit.The 3rd quirk: If you're a bit claustrophobic you may have issues. As you'll see in the pictures, the entire restaurant is essentially positioned in a hallway, with counter seating to the left and table seating to the right. What you see is what you get...there are only a small number of tables available. There is no back room. As soon as you walk in you can see the entire restaurant, and during the long walk to the bathroom in the back you'll have to say a few \"Excuse mes\" as you dodge servers and other patrons in a path that's only made for one.So it's not a great place for a romantic evening for two, unless you're like me and the romance comes from great company and truly outstanding food.So is it worth it? YES! The service is great, without any pretentious airs, and the food is truly outstanding in a town full of great eateries. Avec is now on our regular circuit of Chicago restaurants we must eat at while in town.CHORIZO STUFFED DATES: Yes, there is a reason why nearly every table gets this. One of two or three truly outstanding dishes I've ever had in my life. These are chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. The ingredients sound a bit jarring, like they would overwhelm, but they blend perfectly together. Even the pepper-tomato sauce, which in most places merely covers a up a mediocre dish, is elevated at Avec to be the perfect complement to the sweet/salty combination of dates, bacon and sausage, I've had bacon wrapped dates before in other places and was not impressed, and was ready to never order them again. Avec's version with chorizo and the tomato-pepper sauce blows them all away. It is truly a MUST-ORDER item.BRAISED LAMB NECK: This was a large plate, and had a LOT more meat on it than I expected, which was a nice surprise. It is served on the bone, fork-tender, and is perfectly cooked to a flaky, pot roast like consistency. Of the large plates I've tried so far, this has been my favorite. You won't go wrong with this choice.WOOD OVEN PAELLA with confit chicken, snail boudin, mussels and tangerine aioli: Okay, so snail sausage sounds a bit odd...but trust me, it was my favorite thing about this dish. It was well flavored, with just the right amount of spice to keep you coming back for more. The mussels were a great addition, and the chicken was outstanding. The paella itself was well prepared, and this is probably one of the larger, more filling items on the large plate menu.CHARRED SUMMER SQUASH with shishito peppers, almonds, mint and pickled feta: This dish was surprising in its complexity. Everything worked perfectly together, and it was a nice lighter accompaniment to the heavier dishes we ordered. NUTTER BUTTERS: Just order these. It will be the dessert that you talk about after the meal. It comes out in four tiny bite-sized squares of peanut buttery, salty-sweet goodness. You will want more than four bites, so order another one without shame.ROASTED STRAWBERRY RHUBARB COBBLER with spiced shortcakes and orange frozen yogurt: This is a great, homey dish taken to the next level. Perfectly tart and sweet, with a nice blending of flavors.HORCHATA GELATO: If this is on the specials board, order it without fear. It's a great way to end a meal. The ice cream is soft, well spiced horchata-style, and is served with shortbread cookies.", "Date": "2014-07-04", "Author_Location": "Columbus, IN"}, {"Author": "Kate W.", "ReviewID": "kjb6c0FiMdL1PRWU6IYHzA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh God. \u00a0Avec. \u00a0Mmmmm.(1) \u00a0The wait will be long. \u00a0Put your name in and go nearby for a drink. \u00a0We checked out Lone Wolf (delish for a drink!) \u00a0We were told the wait would be over an hour. \u00a0We waited AT MOST 40 minutes. \u00a0Totally do-able.(2) \u00a0Get a bottle of wine. \u00a0They have a few very reasonable, delicious french reds at or near the $40/bottle mark. \u00a0Can't go wrong.(3) GET THE FOCCACIA. \u00a0It has Ricotta and truffle in it and it is AMAZING. \u00a0It's totally exquisite and delicious and I would bring it to work everyday for lunch if I could. \u00a0Oh man.[[ \u00a0On a recent visit, we also tried: \u00a0snap peas (so good we ordered a second round; steak (delish); shrimp pizza (AWESOME); pasta with mushroom bolognese (awful, tbh, oh well); charred asparagus (very very good); labneh cheese with apricots (good but not enough bread); and a sorbet (tasty!) \u00a0]](4) GET THE NUTTER BUTTERS. \u00a0I went with a friend who is OBSESSED with these things. \u00a0We ordered, I'm not kidding, 5 orders (so, 20 little bite sized pieces of heaven). \u00a0We ate them all. \u00a0There were three of us. \u00a0We are disgusting.We left totally full and happy. \u00a0Some people complain about small plates. \u00a0Dummies. \u00a0Ask your server for some advise--they are there to help you! \u00a0They will be happy to point you in the direction of a more substantial plate. \u00a0You'll leave happy and satisfied. \u00a0AND, for the delicious quality of the food, you won't feel like you're getting ripped off. \u00a0Alll that food for three people came to ~180.00 total. \u00a0Not awful!", "Date": "2014-06-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Justin H.", "ReviewID": "rODDhPYbcTA_WwrYRg6XBA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The dates were great.

The list was great because they had several more inexpensive bottles in the 30's range. Great if you want a bottle but aren't looking for something incredible (and expensive). We ordered a French pinot noir for around $35---solid choice!-Server. Our server was helpful and there when we needed to order moreThe not so good:-Expediters. So we ordered 3 or 4 plates total. The first was the aforementioned dates, which comes in a red marinara sauce. We expected to receive new, clean plates after. Sadly, the rest of our food was shoved to the side of the dirtied plates as to avoid the red sauce. After our last small plate, an expediter asked if we wanted new plates. Kind of funny. -Food. Beyond the dates, the other food was just okay. Everything sounded great on paper, but just didn't blow me away. -Price. Fairly pricey for small plates to begin with.

When I lived in Chicago, it was the place I would lumber in to, escaping the brutal cold with an eclectic wine list and food that is a powerful combination of delicious and creative. The offerings here and comfy without being hokey and small plates and half orders give you a chance to sample a nice variety of flavours, making Avec great for one or four. (I'd caution about large groups here--Avec is painfully small and does not take reservations. I have been successful dining alone or with one other in not having to wait terribly long for a table, but given the layout of the restaurant, bigger parties might not be so fortunate.)Avec is a wine-forward restaurant, which is not to denigrate their mixologists but to say that they have an impressive collection of wines that far surpass its size and price point. You can easily find many unique and unconventional bottles or pours without breaking the bank. Waitstaff are impressively polished on the ins-and-outs of the expansive wine offerings.When it comes to food, Avec's small plates (and the ability to order many dishes in half portions) means that the menu can be quite flexible. I generally find two of the smaller dishes and a larger plate is plenty of food for two hungry eaters but you can easily tack on more or less as the meal progresses. Like the rest of the Blackbird group (Pubican, Big Star, Blackbird, Violet Hour) the menu is constantly changing but some things are fixtures--the brandade, the dates, the focaccia, and the pasta. All of these are excellent and show off how capable this kitchen is, but I'll save my plug for the dates. I don't even like dates! Stuffed with chorizo and in a homemade tomato sauce and served with crusty bread, this is satisfying plain and simple. I have ventured in to Avec on my way out of town just to get my fill of those dates. They are the must-have on the menu, and you can try them in a half order (2), if you remain unconvinced.Deserts can get fancy and yes are quite good, but I like to keep it simple: a good Intelligentsia cappuccino and an order of nutter butters, four squares of peanut butter and salted caramel.

From top to bottom, just awesome. That's the 2 sentence review for those who don't want to read any further. For those of you trying to sleep, I offer you the following long-winded review. To start, we got there and there was a 30 minute wait so we put our name in and went for a quick walk. 10 minutes later we walk in and suddenly we have a seat. Both people working there that we talked to were super nice, very friendly even though the place was jam packed. We ended up sitting at a table of 10, which consisted of 4 groups - 3, 2, 2, and 3, with the 3s at the ends and the 2s in the middle. So we ended up talking to the other 2 (we were 1) and one of the 3s. Both parties were very friendly, and made the experience better than it would have been otherwise. Yes I know this is luck of the draw and has nothing to do with Avec itself, but it counts. As they say, lucky \u00a0beats good. The waiter, a friendly guy, suggested a bottle of wine that was dirt cheap (well, by comparison with the others) and was very smooth. Something from France, merlot/cab/malbec combo I think. Anyway, wine good, service good, The food, in order of appearance...1. Brussels sprout panzanella. We got this because Andy knows I like brussels sprouts and we wanted to give it a shot. It was fine, good and all. But of the 5 things we got this was the least impressive of them all. For me, and Andy agreed, it really had no core taste of the sprouts. Brussels have a very distinct taste, which I like. It seems like they did all they could to remove that taste and just use the sprouts as a color, more than a flavor. Fine, but I would not get it again, really. 2. Werp farm greens. Of the things we got, this was the one I was expecting the least from. But once it hit the fork and my fork hit my mouth, wow. Just wow. This was possibly the best salad I've ever had. The combination of greens, dressing, mini potatoes, and peas was just lights out. I think maybe this is just right up my alley because I couldn't get enough of it;. Every bite was fantastic. 3a. Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. This came with the Focaccia, thus 3a and 3b. When we sat down to order, the waiter told us this was their signature dish. When the people to our right then proceeded to have it placed on the table in front of them, that more or less sealed the deal. It just looked & smelled stupendously good. And it came with a small hunk of bread that looked perfect. We each got 2 of these since the dish came with 4 pieces. They were good, succulent, dates filled with chorizo and wrapped in bacon. Yes, this does sound incredibly overindulgent in a typical American way, but they were actually most excellent. 3b. Focaccia. This too is apparently a signature dish and is always served with the dates above. The people next to us had gotten this, and they dipped the focaccia pieces in the sauce that came with the dates. This was good, and had a hint of truffle oil that gave it such a sweet, yummy aroma that I was forced to cram every last piece of this massive dish into my mouth by the end of the night. It was worth every single bite.4. Chicken liver crostini. Yes, by this time I was stuffed and had absolutely no need to eat anything else. But this dish is effectively fois gras with bread (did I mention the bread was awesome? No? Well, it was) and some other stuff that I put on top and crammed into my mouth. You know, no matter how full you are, when the dish comes out and it's fois gras, how do you let that go? We were in the hotel for the night so it's not like we were going to bring it back with it. We did it, forced ourselves to eat it, and it was very good. I don't think this was \"holy cow\" amazing. It was good, not great. I'd order something else next time. Ok, that's enough.

The small size of the dining room allows for intimate conversations with good friends. \u00a0If you take a date here, I recommend you make sure there are no better-looking, eligible bachelors/bachelorettes at the table you are about to be seated at... \u00a0Haha. Now for the food. All the reviews I came across before the meal were raving descriptions of the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. I am happy to report that they are indeed phenomenal. The dates are wrapped in savory bacon and served in zesty tomato sauce. Even Susannah, who doesn't particularly care for dates, enjoyed them. A must-order at this restaurant. The octopus plate was crisp and refreshing. Combining the seafood flavors with ruby red grapefruit and fresh mint provided a sharp, citrusy taste to an otherwise stereotypical roasting of octopus. The plate was very well prepared and is a definite order for any octopus-fanatic. The squid plate was also fantastic. The squid and tripe with fideo pasta was interesting and unique. Until this plate, I had never tasted squid ink aioli. I am happy to report that it is delicious and I definitely recommend it to the culinary adventurous individual. Steering away from the seafood and onto the red meat, the Butcher's steak was paired perfectly with the strong flavor of blue cheese crumbles. The crisp kale decoration added a necessary crunch to the plate as well as a green element to an otherwise meaty dish. The incorporation of pistachios on the Merguez sausage pizza brought a contrasting texture to the softness of the melted feta cheese adorning the pizza and the aroma filled the restaurant, attracting the attention of many nearby diners. My favorite large plate was the wood oven paella which combined the delicious flavors of chicken, seafood and a hint of fruit into a single dish. The paella was cooked perfectly and provided a background to the various ingredients namely the mussels and the chicken pieces, both of which were lightly flavored with citrus. The perfect large plate to share for a group that cannot decide between poultry and seafood. It gives you both!For dessert, we ordered a selection of options but my favorite was the chocolate-ricotta mousse. It ws topped with crushed raspberries which provided a fantastic compliment to the richness of the mousse. I am typically adverse to whipped cream but the orlorosso whipped cream added a creaminess to the chocolate-ricotta mousse that I would have missed if I had simply spooned it out. So delicious it's borderline dangerous. Small plates are amazing. They allow diners to share and try multiple dishes, bringing friends together through shared culinary experiences.

Half of the dishes we tried were delicious: the chicken liver crostini and the dates are a must-have. Especially the dates, they're a perfect mix of sweet, savory and spicy.

We also had the salmon, the squid with chorizo casserole and the pork shoulder. I did not like these dishes. The salmon was served with a tomato/beetroot puree that completely overpowered it. Similarly, the squid disappeared in a stormy sea of flavors: orange, cinnamon, beans, chorizo... too much. The pork shoulder was very tender but tasted too much of vinegar in my opinion --- I have to say I am not a fan of sour mains. Plus basically no veggies with it (coriander does not count, right?).

Service was decent. Prices aren't cheap but I wouldn't say it was particularly overpriced, at least for a restaurant of this tier. Long version:This place has been sitting in my bookmarks page for a while, and I finally got my butt over there a few days ago with a friend. Since they don't take reservations and it was a Friday, we got there early (4:30 pm) to avoid a wait.We ordered:- Chorizo stuffed medjool dates: My friend ordered these and said she loved them. I didn't try the dates, but I did try the sauce, which was delightfully spicy but not overpowering. From her reaction, I'm guessing that this dish gets rave reviews for a reason. I did notice that the portion was decently sized - 5 giant, stuffed dates with a bread roll on the side. - Seared shrimp with beans, pesto and vinaigrette: Although there weren't any particularly interesting flavors, the dish was still delicious. It came with three giant pieces of shrimp with heads on, a generous serving of beans, and a delightfully tangy vinaigrette. - Burnt wheat pasta with mussels, broccoli, and 'nduja butter: Not particularly impressed. The noodles were interesting - tasted very whole grain-y and they were hollow (!). The mussels weren't anything special, and I was disappointed by the minimal amount of broccoli. Simply put, this dish basically began tasting like buttered noodles after several bites, and there weren't enough variances in texture/consistency/flavor to keep me interested. - Wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with rice, clams, green beans: This was okay. I'm probably partially biased because I was a bit full by this point. The pork shoulder was very good and juicy near the outside, especially when eaten with the rice and sauce. However, it got a little dry near the middle. I will say the portion size was quite generous. It was $21, but the chunk of shoulder was quite big. Service was so-so. I remember reading some reviews that raved about stellar service, but I wasn't too impressed. Our waitress didn't seem too interested in serving us and wasn't particularly friendly either. However, our water was constantly re-filled and plates cleared away promptly by the busboys. Spent $80 for two people, no drinks.

The hostess was awesome and told us about CH distillery which is right down the street and has lots of great cocktails and much more space. We went there while we waited and the hostess said we would get a text when our table was ready.After drinking a tasty cocktail over there we returned and only waited about 10 minutes until our table was ready.This is where things got good.We ordered a bottle of wine for the table (one of the cheaper reds) and it was good and complimented the food very well. It was also suggested to us by the sommelier/waitress who knew the most about the wines.Food wise we ordered the following,Large Plates:1. wood-fired pizza with PQM pancetta, pear, blue cheese panna and arugula2. slow roasted pork shoulder with clams, braised greens, potato and linguica sausage3. \"deluxe\" focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil and fresh herbs4. whole roasted fish with olives, fennel, arugula, charred orange and lavender vinaigretteSmall Plates:1. whipped brandade with garlic bread and chives2. chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauceWe got a double order of each small plate.The fact that they do small plates and large plates is great. It was perfect for sharing and if you're there by yourself or with just one person a large plate is a great amount for one person.Everything here was crazy amazing and my taste buds and my brain still can't fully comprehend how they made some of this stuff taste so good.The only thing that I wouldn't order again but was still tasty was the Large Plate #3. It was a lot simpler than the other dishes and didn't pack as much flavor and was a tad bit bitter.I would love to try some more of their menu (even though I'm at least half way through it) and I would HIGHLY recommend the chorizo stuffed & bacon wrapped dates and the slow roasted pork shoulder.The dates melt in your mouth and go through three stages of delicious flavor and two stages of meat.The pork shoulder is slow roasted all together with the other ingredients in a deep metal dish and the flavors blend perfectly and everything just falls off the bone.If you are considering going here for dinner, stop thinking about it and just do it.

From here on out I will definitely be making up for all that missed time without this amazing food in my life!It was a Tuesday night and as the snow fell outside, this tiny space on Chicago's Near West Side was bursting at the seams with energy. Conversation and laughter filled the restaurant as wine flowed and food was savored, all to the soundtrack of Biggie Smalls playing in the background...what's not to love?!Being the tiny space that it is, along with their no reservation policy, Avec is usually a fairly crowded spot any night of the week. When we arrived there were a few seats open at the bar, so my two dining partners and I snagged those up and settled in. For a group of 1-3 the bar works fine, I usually prefer the bar if it's just me or me and one other person because I love chatting with the bartenders and getting their opinion on what to order.Avec has a variety of small and large plates that are all perfect for sharing-my favorite way to go! Their menu is filled with Mediterranean classics, pulling from regions of France, Portugal, Italy, and the coast of Spain. The twist? A Midwestern interpretation that makes these dishes interesting and comforting at the same time. We perused the menu over a lovely plate of house-marinated olives...the perfect first bites to give us a taste of what was in store.Our first dish was the Brandade. No idea what brandade is? Neither did I. Per Wikipedia, Brandade is an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil eaten in winter with bread or potatoes. It was delicious....and now I know that I love brandade! We also ordered their much-loved Chorizo-Stuffed Medjool Dates and as soon as that first bite hit my tastebuds, I knew that this dish was the winner of the night. The spicy kick from the chorizo and pepper sauce combined with the slight sweetness of the dates and the saltiness of the bacon is a PERFECT combination!As hard as it was to follow the dates, we thoroughly enjoyed our next few dishes as well-charcuterie and cheese boards and the refreshing brussels sprout panzanella to round out the meal. The brussels sprout salad was really fantastic-if you think you don't like brussels sprouts...I challenge you to try this salad and see if you feel a little different about these mini cabbages afterwards!Luckily my friend that I dined with had been to Avec a time or two. Even though we were happily full at this point, he let us know that Avec's version of the Nutter Butter was not to be missed. After quickly polishing off the four pieces in our first order, \u00a0he and I exchanged glances and knew that a second order was going to be needed! You definitely do not want to miss these...and I guarantee that you can't eat just one!Bottom line: if you haven't been to Avec, get there!

It means you live a good life and don't have to endulge in this perfect dish.\"deluxe\" focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, truffle oil and fresh herbs- Last time I came here, the focaccia came as the LAST dish - I thought that worked better than having it as the 2nd dish because this \"large plate\" is more like a dessert plate or appetizer. So starting with it or ending with it should be better, because the focaccia is like eating a really savory biscuit with pungent scent of truffle oil, so having it in the middle of the meal was a little strange, but regardless GREAT. If you like the scent of truffles, this dish will not disappoint you.Random fun fact - did you know truffle oil isn't made out of truffles? Cool.Oyster mushrooms with roasted artichokes, goat feta, endive and black garlic vinaigrette- Maybe Avec DID purposely give us the focaccia 2nd just so they could give us this dish afterwards. The focaccia was very buttery and oily so this oyster mushroom \"salad\" was PERFECT. Perfect addition of greens and vinaigrette to cleanse our mouth. And the oyster mushrooms! I've never had it yet, but WOW. SO SAVORY AND SO GOOD. Who ever said mushrooms had no taste? Try this try this try this.Burnt wheat pasta with mussels, broccoli, and 'nduja butter- SAD FACE :( I was so disappointed by this dish...We originally wanted the squid ink pasta, but they didn't have it on the menu anymore so we opted for THIS pasta. I mean, \"burnt wheat pasta\" + \"mussels\" sound great, right? Hmm...I wasn't too pleased. The pasta was indeed very peculiar - they looked like (dont google this if youre going to order this. really, dont.) mermithidae.....And the pasta has a HOLE in the middle! how cool?! I don't know...the pasta definitely tasted undercooked, but that's probably because of the \"burnt\" and \"wheat\" part...anyways, it just didn't satisfy me, and definitely made me a little sad because it was the last dish...Dessert - I cant find the name on the online menu! But it was basically an apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and caramel. Very very very delicious and the flaky layers of the pie was so great.

This time I came for brunch, which wasn't very crowded at all, though I was a bit annoyed by the hostess who refused to seat us before our final guest arrived, so the 3 of us huddled by the limited space near the entrance in everybody's way for a good 20 minutes, watching the tables rapidly filling up. They were doing special collaboration brunches, and the day we went it was with CH distillery, so there were a few special cocktails. Since it was too early for me to drink, I skipped the drinks and went for the coffee, girlfriends enjoyed their drinks though. We ordered whitefish spread, coddled eggs, brussel sprouts panzanella, moroccan berghir pancakes and breakfast paella (yes, we were hungry gals!). I thought the whitefish spread was nice in flavors but a bit too thick, panzanella was flavorful but a tad garlic-heavy for brunch. Loved the coddled eggs so much I want to bathe in it, and the spices on the chicken wings that came with the pancakes made me want to move to the next table (although the wings were nice & juicy). We noticed the group next to us also order the paella and left most of it intact when they left, so we were a bit worried. But it turned out to be lovely: strong saffron flavors in the perfectly cooked rice, juicy chicken pieces & duck sausages.

The shrimp is spiced perfectly, and the unique combination of the corona beans, radish top pest and roasted radish with limoncello vinaigrette makes the dish a satisfying treat.Lamb sausage - As a huge lamb fan, this was not my favorite dish.

I came here with my friend that I was visiting in Chicago, and this was one of the restaurants on our must-go list. With reviews always talking about how long the line is and how this place doesn't take reservation, we decided to come here early at around 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. When we got there, half the restaurant was empty so we got seated right away. What we got: Chorizo-Stuffed Dates: heaven on earth. Literally. If i could eat this forever, I would. I would also probably come here JUST for this. Yes, I would fly 4-5 hours from SoCal to Chicago and take the EL train to Avec JUST FOR THIS.....if i had the money to, that is. If you don't get this dish here, you're completely out of your mind. Originally, I was scared that it'd be too salty because the dates are stuffed with chorizo (which is already a saltier type of meat) but it's ALSO wrapped in bacon (which is also on the salty side), but the dates were sweet enough to counter balance that and the tomato based sauce that the dates came with was rich and spicy enough to just balance everything together. The sauce was so good, if I had extra bread, I probably would've cleaned the plate. Shrimp: My friend ordered this, and I didn't have any of this, but the shrimps looked like a good portion and my \u00a0friend seemed to enjoy it. Burnt Flour Pasta: This was meh. There wasn't much to it, the pasta was kind of oily from all the butter, no outstanding flavors, and the pasta just tasted like whole wheat. Pork Shoulder: This was also really good. The pork shoulder was pretty soft and moist for the most part and I liked how they used clams and rice to counter balance the rich flavors and the rice really soaked up all the flavors of both the pork and clams, which I enjoyed. The portion is really big so it's worth the $21, but I was literally bursting by the end of the meal. The only part I didn't like about the dish was this weird yellow mustard-y sauce they put on top of the pork. I could've done without it and I personally think it would've tasted much better without it, but again, that's just me. The only complaint I have about this restaurant is that the service kind of sucked.

So what? we popped over to blackbird for a cocktail! basically killing two birds with one stone! \u00a0About 15 mins later, as we just put in our drink orders at Blackbird, avec called us! what a tease! So we chugged our drinks and head back to avec. The communal table at avec is what people often complain about - I don't care. I actually don't understand why people make such a big deal out of \"personal space.\" Back in Asia I basically got touched and pushed by strangers all day long - in a platonic non-creepy way. Plus I always peek at people's food to make sure I order the right thing, so their seating style was actually a plus. Needless to say we struck up a conversation and a quick laugh with the table next to us. The 4 of us shared some plates: bacon dates, octopus, focaccia, pork shoulder, asparagus, and the affogato and carrot cake for desert! The amount of food was fine for 4 people, but I'd be honest and say if it was just me and the boy we'd probably order at least 2-3 more dish. Everything looks and sounds delicious. We were eating with friends so we had to behave! \u00a0The quality of the food is another story. Everything was delicious and well-done. My personal favorite is the grilled octopus and the focaccia - crispy bread, melty cheese, and a perfect touch of truffle aroma and herbs. My friends also complimented on the bacon dates and the pork shoulder, which combined the perfect amount of tender and fatty meat well done - the meat was cooked soo well we didn't even need a knife, and it melted in your mouth! Desert is probably Avec's weakness. I loved my affogato, but I didn't care for the carrot cake much, it was rather dry! But tis ok, I was happy with the rest of the meal. Service was good, and the space/decor was unique. Perhaps among the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago. With a bottle of wine and the plates, we spent $40/person which was not bad at all.

I was swimming (breast stroke, darling: the crawl is so pedestrian) at the Everglades Club with that trout-eyed Auchincloss clan. Bippy was sunning himself at The Breakers (or so he says, but we ALL know what he was REALLY doing) and Mother and George Hamilton were carrying-on like a pair of love-sick public-school teenagers at Mar-A-Lago. A man, a tan, a plan: George Hamilton.We never -- NEVER -- learned the cause. The coroner's report read death was asphyxiation by ascot. Gloria told Truman who told Slim who told Papa who told Juan in a rum-fueled conversation over the care and cultivation of dasyglossum orchids that Unc suffered from an overdose of Sudanese blister beetle, and yet the general manager at The Chesterfield hinted at FOWL PLAY at the hand of a band of nefarious, unsavory characters who had assembled in The Leopard Lounge that evening, guests of The Sultan's.Well, you know me: I can't abide a lack of closure and I won't. Obviously upset \u00a0by the 50-year anniversary of Uncle Oswald's death yesterday -- why, I had to take a fourth gimlet just to calm my nerves -- Maurice announced that it was time to put an end to our search for an explanation. He called an Emergency Seance, which frankly, is out-of-line: he may be family but he's still staff. I'm sure he had my best of intentions at heart so I didn't raise a fuss. Bippy showed for the event, as did Mya and Wolf (who were already at Chez Moi to adjust my sphenoids), we dragged Chef out of the kitchen, and of course my BFF Eugenia arrived in a minute, as God knows she has nothing better to do with her day.That's seven. And everyone -- EVERYONE -- knows that it takes eight -- Eight is Enough -- to conduct a proper seance. So what did Maurice do? Do you guess? Do you guess? Do you? He invited Blanche (Blanche!). She had the audacity to arrive by private helicopter, escorted by those insufferable, adolescent Brant Boys. I'll have no part of them.AND....Nothing! We tried, but we could not summon dear Uncle Oswald from his grave. His demise remains a mystery....Well, let me tell YOU: nothing stimulates the appetite as much as an attempt to rouse the dead! Maurice suggested that the eight of us -- minus Chef and Mya and Wolf, mere hired help -- five of us actually, try Avec for dinner.Avec. Avec!

Friendly servers and bartenders, if they are a bit rough around the edges. And those wines by the glass. Delightful! We each had four! I found the brandade and pork shoulder To Die For, but let me tell you this....THAT TRUFFLE FOCACCIA BREAD was tastier than any lover Mother, Bippy or I have sampled, or shared, and that's saying a lot! I would have never tried it -- focaccia is a tad blue-collar for someone as sophisticated as myself -- but the couple next to us swore by it. Imagine! Me! Talking to strangers! Noshing on scrumptious focaccia! In fact the communal seating -- as dreadful as it sounds -- was a hoot!Anyway, I am returning to Avec to try their bacon-wrapped medjool dates (I haven't indulged in that dish since Serge and I visited the Gettys in Marrakech (before Tabitha's drug-addled descent into madness, paranoia and death)). With Maurice, of course. And if we can entreat Uncle Oswald to join us (he was a man of refined taste, afterall), we shall.

Well decorated with a great vibe. It had been on my list of restaurants to try for about a year before I finally made it there. Man, was I missing out! It was a Saturday night and my two friends and I got a table within 30 minutes. The turnover is pretty quick which is a mega plus at a popular restaurant on Randolph Street on a weekend night. The food is pretty fantastic with a few minor faults here and there. We had the chorizo stuffed bacon-wrapped dates which totally lived up to their rave reviews. SLURP! The pork shoulder was really tender, but there was an abundance of rice and a lack of salt. The squid ink pasta was good, it's just that kind of dish that I want to love, but I can only bring myself to go with a \"like\" review. The thought of consuming the oyster mushrooms and the wood-fired squid amatriciana again causes me to salivate. The service was great. Food came out of the kitchen quick, and our server was very kind and knowledgable about food and wine. Another thing that I noticed and loved was the attention to the music selection. Radiohead, The Cure and Depeche Mode with dinner made it even more delectable. Just short of 5-stars for me because of my food review and the fact that if someone has to get up to the restroom, the entire row of people has to get up. Community style seating. Love Avec!

Anyway, thank you for that! The food itself is deserving of accolades though.- Yes, the chorizo stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce is deserving of all the hype. The dish has a bit of a spicy kick and paired with the undernote of sweetness from the dates, it's quite delicious. I had to sop up the rest of the tomato sauce with bread too.- Burrata with marinated tomatoes and pork bits. The warm cheese was very delicious, and went very well with the accompaniments. - Wood oven roasted pork shoulder with braised flageolet and roman beans, kielbasa, and pickled banana pepper relish. This dish was awesome! It came out in a small pot and the meat was so tender it fell apart in the mouth. The stew it was cooked in seeped into the meat to really produce a tender, delicious dish.- Pizza with anchovy and greens. This was also quite delicious, and made up for the fact that we accidentally ordered it instead of the flatbread. The salty/briny taste from the anchovy was actually very good on the pizza! (I'm not normally an anchovy on pizza type of guy)The ambience was cool, a small space with a wooden interior (it kind of looks like a sauna, but doesn't feel like one...) and very modern.

I pretty much ate the whole thing myself. It melts in your mouth and gives it flavors you didn't think was possible in just a flatbread.We also tried the wood-fired squid, which was on what I think was a bed of noodles / pasta. Each bite burst with flavor, and the squid was grilled to have the perfect crunchy firmness to it, married by the soft al dente noodles below.

Well, you say \"fuck all of you\" and go to a nice dinner/ drinks with wonderful company. That is what I did, and Avec was the right spot to get away from a shitty work week.A lovely friend and fellow yelper suggested we go to Avec. I have never been there, I heard about the bad wait times. I am not a fan of waiting, no matter how good the place is. When my dinner companion assured we will not wait for long, I jumped at it. Perfect.The interior looks like an upscale Finnish sauna. I have seen enough of them in Scandinavia to tell the upscale ones from the cheap ones. I was tempted to take my clothes off, wrap a towel, and sweat out. Don't worry, my clothes stayed on the entire time. I am well behaved in public, and company of women. You see sir, I am a gentleman, after all!We were greeted by our server Josh with two glasses of Gran Sarao Rose while waiting to be seated. Nice! The bubbly was perfect for the gloomy weather and delectable food to follow.We started with the frog legs. The combination of flavors was outstanding. Crispy fried fennel goes very well with paprika aoili, and proscuitto. Having never had frog legs before, my dinner companion was thoroughly impressed. A perfect start to a wonderful meal to follow.We moved on to the focaccia with truffle oil and herbs. It was a pure delight. I ate most of it within 2 minutes (not appropriate when you are sitting next to a lady). Josh kept refilling our wine glasses and we were enjoying our dinner and conversation.The experience till this point was 4 star. That is when we ordered the medjool dates. Stuffed with chorizo, wrapped in bacon, with a piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. Holy slut of Jesus, I just had a memory bitchslap. You know when you eat something so good that you remember past memories? No? You say I am the only weird one that has memory flashbacks when I eat amazing food? Whatever, let's get to the review at hand.I got on the bar counter, took off my pants, and asked the chef to \"take\" me right there.... on the bar counter. Fuck yeah! You deserve some kind of a sexual favor for making dates taste this good. The sweetness of a date balanced out with the smoky flavor of bacon and peppery tomato sauce. Fuck me God, right now! And give it to me gooood! Oh yeah!!No, that did not happen. Remember, I am well behaved in public and the company of women. So, I secretly wished my \"bar counter\" fantasy would come true. I didn't say a word for a good few minutes while enjoying the dates. I am sure my companion was wondering why the hell I suddenly muted myself while I have been yapping about my international healthcare drama until a minute ago. Well, I was silent because I was having my \"bar counter\" fantasy, induced by the medjool dates.I lived in the Sahara desert for 4 frickin' years. I was surrounded with all kinds of dates, yet never liked them. My mom tried to feed me that shit for lunch and dinner.Mom: here beta (beta = son, in Hindi) have some dates. They are good for you... and they are fresh from Dr. Merzouk's garden (Dr. Merzouk = my dad's colleague)Me: wtf? This shit is nasty *inside voice*Mom: It's either dates or (horse) milk, what do you want?Me: *gobbles up the dates*It took a restaurant in Chicago to make me like them. How strange is that?After having a barrage of inappropriate thoughts, I realized it is rude to stay silent with a boner in my pants. Times like these I am glad I went to Avec in my work attire, a monkey suit. In order to come back to reality I decided to take a look at the dessert menu. We ordered the vanilla crepes with kumquats. Two crepes filled with cheesy goodness surrounded by delicious kumquats. It completed our evening of extraordinary food journey.We sat by the bar counter instead of getting a table. I like communal seating, and Avec does a good job at keeping the communal seating in order. It is not an ideal date location because it is loud. As with any communal seating restaurants the vibe is casual, and everyone was well dressed. Josh did an excellent job taking care of us, my wine glass was always full.Thanks to my dinner companion for the lovely company and introducing me to Avec. I will definitely go again.

It's not for lack of trying though. On more than one occasion, I've gotten through the entry to be greeted by the throngs of washed masses and a hostess quoting hour-plus wait times. The entryway/waiting area is very small, however, and due to my diminutive stature, I'm easily pushed around by others trying to pass. This, combined with a low-grade claustrophobia (resulting from the time I got stuck in a hula hoop), makes waiting at a crowded establishment that doesn't accept resos a bit unappealing for me. In honor of a new facebook friend's arrival from The Angels, CA, I decided to suck in my gut and brave the crowd in search of one of Chicago's more lauded dinners. Despite the unreasonably cold weather and the fact that it was a Monday night, we still waited over an hour for our party of 8 to be seated. The beer list, while limited, was very very nice, composed mostly of foreign beers I haven't heard of, but I'm sure are better because they're from a different country. The food menu was pretty much what I expected. Not a whole lot of veggie options. I think everyone in our groups' eyes quickly fixated on one thing - the whole roasted foie gras. The foie is listed as M.P. Now, I'm not a purveyor of organ meats, but I know someone who very regularly purchases whole lobes, and he says the price he pays hasn't fluctuated in over a year. Granted, Avec's duck liver is from a specific region and perhaps a specific farm, but I've heard other diners say they paid $86 for the same dish we were lucky to acquire at $70. What's up with that? The foie was glorious, as was most of the food we received. The focus seems to be on taste, far more than presentation. I personally don't care too much about presentation, since everything looks the same on the way out, but I was actually surprised that most of our dishes arrived looking like Jan, yet tasted more like Marcia. Upon leaving, it occurred to me to take a quick look at the open kitchen. My name is Matt, but let me be Frank with you.... The kitchen area seems tiny. I saw a wood-burning oven and maybe a couple burners, but not a whole lot more. I have no idea how they crank out that much food there. When you go, you should check it out, it's rather impressive.Now, to my 3 loyal readers: Sorry for this review that some may actually find useful (and ROTD-worthy).

I love the location of the restaurant because it feels non-touristy which is a refreshing departure from my River North \u00a0residency (plus parking is easy to find). Blackbird is right next door. The restaurant is owned by the same partners. Fortunately, there was a seat available at the bar. My first impression was mixed. The dining room is essentially one long \"hallway\" with two parallel rows: the bar and a row of tables. The bar area is covered in a stainless steel kitchen surface. The tables have a harsh fluorescent lighting. Not my fave, especially since it gives the wood decor a cold feeling. So instead of having a warm natural feel, avec has a clinical vibe to it. It didn't matter too much because the joint was humming with energy supplied by the constant exchange of dialogue. It's that patented social white noise that let's you know people are having fun. The menu is succinct which is usually a sign that most of the menu items are strong. I knew right away what I wanted: Baked Escargot with white wine, pancetta, and herbs followed by Bucatini with housemade italian sausage, veal, tomato, fresh herbs and reggiano. Yum Yum! The escargot were perfectly cooked. This dish is excellent; not drowned in butter. The flavors were balanced and I could taste each ingredient. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough bread to mop up all the deelish sauce. I would warn those who are timid to avoid this dish because the snails are not disguised (they shouldn't be anyway). The bucatini was to die for. Perfectly al dente and napped with just the right amount of stewed tomato sauce. This is why pasta is sexy to eat. The veal flavor is bold. Just a proper bowl of f--king good pasta. There were several items that I wanted to sample, but I didn't have the appetite. Avec is as \"recession-friendly\" as a restaurant of its caliber can get. My two courses set me back $26. And two people with mild appetites could have shared what I ordered. I am less price sensitive when it comes to dining out so I had to have some vino with dinner. Avec offers several wines by the glass ranging between $11-$15 for most. My server was awesome. She recommended two good wines that paired very nicely.

The Service:Never in my life have I waited so long to order a drink and food. \u00a0Not only that, but the service was simply snobby. \u00a0This improved at the bar, the guy serving water was really nice and a breath of fresh air to this establishment, but everyone else was less than disappointing if there is such a thing. \u00a0Being from San Francisco and moving to New York, I don't really think that these folks have a leg to stand on and whatever they think they have..well let's just say this, you should always be nice to everyone. \u00a0I feel like this establishment has forgotten this essential fact of service. The Food:We got everything the server recommended. \u00a0We got the chorizo stuffed medjols, the foccacio, and the pork belly. \u00a0All of them were just not hitting it for us. \u00a0They were simply OK. \u00a0That's all and good but when you want to cram me on a bench next to other people, I don't know your food better be damn good. \u00a0All and all, I felt like none of it had any real flavor. \u00a0Looking around the loud, crammed dining room I felt sorry for people who thought this was a great dining experience. The Wine:We got a primitivo. \u00a0I overheard the bartender telling the people next to me that this was fruity and spicy. \u00a0We got that bottle and there was nothing spicy about it. \u00a0It was truly a corner store type of wine. \u00a0It reminded me of Yellowtaiil. \u00a0We get that in San Francisco for less than $10 a bottle..........You would think that with such an extensive wine list that they would have a someone who could help customers with wines.

EAT THESE. \u00a0If you can find fault in chorizo stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates, I'd like to know all about it, because I feel this may be the most perfect food around.* Whipped brandade with housemade garlic bread and chives. \u00a0I'm still a little clear on what this is exactly, but what I do know is that it's some kind of whipped up, cheesy and herby fish that you spread on garlic toast. \u00a0Very tasty!* Local apple salad with manchego, marcona almonds, celery and apple cider. \u00a0What? \u00a0We're at least kind of healthy with this light and fruity salad. * Marinated hanger steak with roasted shallots and brussels sprouts salsa verde. \u00a0Tied for a close second for \"Favorite Dish of the Night\" with the pork shoulder, this dish is spectacular. \u00a0I'm slowly learning to order my steak more on the medium to medium rare side (which is how this is prepared). \u00a0It makes it so much easier to enjoy when the steak is cooked and seasoned to perfection.* 50/50 sausage with creamed kale, pearl onions and navel orange gremolata. A little rich and fatty for my taste, but a nice concept.* Open-faced chicken sandwich with housemade pumpernickel and squash. \u00a0My throwaway dish for the night. \u00a0Nothing spectacular or even very interesting. \u00a0But I suppose putting chicken on the menu does make your restaurant a bit more accessible for the masses.While the food is great, there are a few issues with avec. \u00a01.

The restaurant itself is fairly small but it is, by far, the most coolest restaurant that I've ever dined in. \u00a0The decor is a testament to simplicity. \u00a0It is a narrow dining space with communal tables and bench seating but the use of wood throughout the restaurant creates a streamlined cohesiveness that is very pleasing to the eye. \u00a0The staff here was very pleasant and helpful. I'm not sure who was in charge of the play list but the music here was fantastic! It's always makes me giddy to hear good ear candy at a restaurant and none of that top 40 stuff. On to the important stuff, the food! The menu at Avec is fairly extensive with various small and large plates to share. Think of it as a French tapas style restaurant if you will. I haven't dined here since September '09 but the following dishes will forever hold a warm, delicious memory in my heart... and stomach:Chorizo Stuffed Medjool Dates Three words: Oh Em Gee. Ok, those are letters. A few more words then: The best dates I've ever had!! This was the first time I've ever eaten a date (hah!) and it just completely blew our table away. They were wrapped in smoked bacon and accompanied by a peppery tomato sauce. This dish was just absolutely divine. Tuna Apple Flatbread PizzaIt seems like an odd combination but the tuna and crisp apple were perfect complements. \u00a0I'm not really a fan of pizza but this was a great divergent from your traditional pizza. \u00a0It was very light and refreshing. Meatballs with OrzoWe spent some time trying to figure out what Orzo was as it looks and tastes a lot like rice. \u00a0The meatballs were flavorful and delicious. We also ordered the Wood Braised Pork Shoulder, Fois Gras, Chicken, and some other meat dish (overall a lot of meat that night!) but I can't quite remember the details of each dish. \u00a0I do recall that none of us at our table of four were disappointed by any of the dishes that we were served. \u00a0The food just continued to amaze and delight our palates. To the chefs of Avec: Kudos for making such an outstanding meal!

Conversation dominated by a middle-aged guy in a bright red Polo pullover, gray hair slicked back and slightly tousled in a style I can only call \"country club mystique,\" trying very hard to impress the other two with his erudite knowledge of the food and wine. \u00a0Whatever this guy's name is, I'm guessing he went by \"Chaz\" in the 80's and likes to tie an argyle sweater around his shoulders to protect himself from the crisp breeze while he's out yachting. \u00a0The only moment of intermingling between any of the parties at the table was when this fellow announced, \"I saw that!\" after I accidentally dropped a slice of dried ginger into my lap.

He came to our table one minute after we sat down, and told us in a bossy, unfriendly tone that he was taking care of both our group and Chaz's group and so he really wanted to put the parties' orders in together. \u00a0Then he asked what we wanted, and of course my date and I had no idea, but Chaz said something like, \"WE'RE ready, let's get this thing going, baby!\" \u00a0So, of course, the orders went in separately. \u00a0Sergeant Josh also acted annoyed and defensive when I added a fruit side to our cheese plate-- he said in an accusing tone, \"I thought you decided against that.\" \u00a0Well I did, Josh, but I changed my mind, and now I'd be very appreciative if I could get the MF-ing fruit plate!Finally, a love note. \u00a0Dearest Avec: \u00a0How do I love thee? \u00a0Not at all. \u00a0A few words about beer, my darling.

Wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with braised flageolet & romano beans, PQM kielbasa, and pickled banana pepper relish - If there were a bone it would have the melts off the bone effect.

Two things that don't bode well for business discussions and since about half of my eating out is work related in some way- Avec just fell to the side until I could make a personal visit on a night (Monday) at a time (6pm) where I thought the wait might be minimized. And it was. We were seated immediately at the very back table right in front of the kitchen area. We started with some of the cheeses from \"the cave\" and the assorted salami plate. Terrific. And the bread that came to the table was so tasty as well. A friend had told me about the chorizo stuffed dates so we had to order those. And he was right. They were exceptional. For entrees- we split the the pasta special of the day which was angel hair pasta with squid. Delicious. And finally, we tried the turkey meatballs with orzo. Perfect as well. While several of that day's desserts sounded tempting- we decided to forego more food for an after dinner drink as we brought the evening to a close. While the food was great- service was a bit off. Our server acted like she didn't know the menu and was slow to come up with suggestions. Also- we shared everything which seemed to again throw her off.

Now, I usually don't like this dish. I've had bacon wrapped dates multiple times at many Spanish tapas places, and I've never liked it. My companions always order it, and I always get offered one, but I just didn't like the mushy, sweetness of the dates with the hard (not crispy), semi-salty bacon. It wasn't my thing, and I was almost sure that I wouldn't like Avec's version either. I was wrong though. Avec's was slightly spicy thanks to the peppery tomato sauce, and I love the chunkiness of the chorizo with the mushy, sweet dates and the salty, savory bacon. This plate of bacon wrapped dates was the best I've ever had. We also ordered the hanger steak with shaved artichokes, dried crimini mushrooms, pine nuts, parmesan and kale chips. It sounded good, but actually, this was my least favorite dish. First, I didn't think that the crimini mushrooms would be dried. It didn't mention it on the menu. It was like eating it straight out of a bag of sliced dried shiitake mushrooms (except that shiitake would have been more fragrant)... It was strange to me. Second, the flavors of the toppings were so overpowering that I didn't enjoy the steak. The toppings had a very herby taste to it. Finally, I thought the steak was a little dry too. For our last dish, we ordered the wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with braised collard greens, wild rice, and green tomato chow chow. I don't know what green tomato chow chow means, but the dish was very good and savory. I liked this one a lot too, if only because it reminded me a little bit (very, very faintly!) of my mom's bo kho (Vietnamese beef stew, except that my mom made it with lamb meat). I was also surprised by the wild rice, and at first I thought it was the black forbidden rice from China. It tasted very good, and the broth was very fatty. It was perfect for dipping your bread into after you're done with the meat. I had a very fun and enjoyable meal here, and we had some fun talking to our neighbors next to us at the communal table.

They try to seat as many as possible by doing shared tables, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it works out OK.So we got there at 6:30, and the nice thing is that they take your phone number to call you when your table is almost ready. I definitely suggest going a few blocks down Randolph to the Haymarket Pub & Brewery (which will also be crowded) to grab a beer. They have an awesome selection and it's a cool place. If it's not too cold of a night, you can also order drinks and stand outside by the heaters.

If you like pork at all, you will love this dish. \u00a0The dates with the tomato sauce is a revelation. \u00a0The other fantastic perk is that you can order a half-serving of the dish, so you get two instead of four.Wagyu: Really smart move to take the coulette cut (top sirloin cap, which can be tough), and use wagyu and marinate it, which gives you fantastic flavor with tenderness. The combination of the beef with the salsa verde was fresh and delicious.Lamb: Disclaimer - I love pappardelle with braised meats in general, so I was predisposed to like this dish. \u00a0It met my expectations. The lamb neck was flavorful and delicious. The only problem I had with this dish was that it was a little bit oily.Ordinarily, I would be hesitant to give 5 stars to a restaurant I've only been to once and only had 3 dishes at, but all three dishes were superb and you can tell that they run a great operation here.

The wooden panel interior, the communal tables, the long stainless steel bar, the attentive service...it all served to transport you from a random street in downtown Chicago to a world where you got delicious food with friendly people. \u00a0The two people sitting next to me struck up random conversations with me and it felt totally natural. One guy next to me was on a business trip like me and had come two nights in a row because the pappardelle was so good. \u00a0 The decor, vibe, layout, and food all reminded me a lot of one of my favorite restaurants in NYC - Momofuku Ssam Bar - and in my mind, it's hard to beat that.2. Everyone was incredibly thoughtful. When I got there, it was a 30 min wait even though I went on a Wednesday at 9pm, but they took my cell phone number and so I could wander around the neighborhood while waiting. Everyone introduced themselves by name. The hostess introduced herself and Tess and remembered my name throughout the night. Same with my server Josh, who was great and kept warning me that I might be ordering too much food (I proved him wrong though!)...how often do you have a server tell you to stop ordering?! The space was tight but because the hostess offered to take your coat and bags and stored them in the back, it didn't get too cramped.

I have been working in a family run restaurant since I was 11. I have extreme amounts of patience when it comes to a lot of things that customers usually get irritated at--waiting for a table, waiter incompetence, an empty water glass, wrong orders, etc etc. What most people would complain about, I can deal with.Both times - 2 hour wait. Not a big deal. Ordered the non traditional pre dinner drink of white port bc I can't find it anywhere else in the city. Drank that while we waited. Oh, and thanks to the girl who passed the bar...she and her husband bought my lady and me another round of drinks the second time we went. Much appreciated and they were adorable. :)First time - the food was so so and the infamous dates were so spicy, I could taste nothing but fire in my mouth. Ordered a couple of salads...nothing memorable. Got the bill....what I expected for a restaurant in that area....maybe just a bad night. Waitress was friendly but managed to overtip herself by $10 when I had already left her 25%...hey, not her fault I didn't like the food but don't charge me an extra $10 for it. My fault I ordered it. The admin was great about it though and my credit card was refunded within 2 days.Second time - Autumn spiced pate...not good. Infamous dates....were ok; I wasn't that impressed. Less spicy than the first time...but a little too much even still for me. The gf said they were ok, better than last time. Ordered a white fish entree and turkey meatballs, both were hearty but not very flavorful. Meatballs were a little dry...even for turkey. Waitress again was very kind and pleasant.Saving grace? Staff is nice though a little slow; it's kind of understandable since they're always ridiculously busy. The hostess...I have to say...hats off to you for not socking the guy in the face who keeps throwing f-bombs at you bc he had to wait an extra 15 min. I'm sure that happens a lot.I would have given it another star if it wasn't so overpriced. ($125ish for 2 drinks, 4 small dishes, 20% tip.)

The food was, for the most part, delicious - bacon-wrapped, chorizo stuffed dates may be the best bites in Chicago, the brandade was delectably fishy and creamy, and the braised pork shoulder was almost impossibly tender and juicy - like love in meat form. The signature focaccia (served Ligurian style with ricotta in between two layers of flaky crust) was a nice dish, although I'd only advocate ordering it in a group of 4 or more people, as we thought it was a little overwhelming. The octopus with chickpeas was perfectly seasoned and very unique; I found the chickpeas undercooked, but I confess that this is likely due to my hummus fanaticism. The tomatoes in the heirloom and white anchovy salad were multicolored and perfectly ripe, although some in the party thought it contained too much fennel and not enough anchovy. However, I loved it.The service is five star service, if not six star service. One member of our party was about an hour late, and while they obviously couldn't seat us before our party was complete, the hostess made an extra effort to get us seated as soon as he arrived, and the bartender (although I'm sure she was miffed in actuality) displayed no disappointment when we sat at the bar for an hour and ordered 2 drinks in total.

Let's start with the dates..easily the best dates I've eaten ever. Ever. Sweet, salty, soft. The whitefish was complemented with a pistachio puree, beets and grapefruit. The beets added a subtle earthy sweet flavor, in addition to the citrus, which also had hints of sours. The pork shoulder looked like it wasn't going to fill the two of us..wound up being difficult to finish. Not because it was disastrously tasteless, but it was deceivingly large. In fact, this pork shoulder is classic comfort food.

A concoction of very small pieces of squid and fideo swimming in a pretty pedestrian tomato sauce (tasted like marinara out of the jar).The special antipasti, consisting of kale, thinly sliced fennel, and cauliflower in a vinagrette was good....maybe the most enjoyable thing we had.Service was attentive, but felt a bit rushed.

It came in a little pot accompanied with potatoes and i think butternut squash. The pork shoulder tastes exactly like my mom's pork that she uses in soup just for the flavor.

this was a whole lot of cheese and bread and we still had four plates to go, but working diligently the plate did eventually disappear - every single bite worth it.Slowly enjoying the focaccia the next two items were certainly not something I would have ordered on my own but much like everything else Avec did that evening there was a beautiful balance to the simplicity of each and although I would not order either again I did enjoy what I ate from each, the first \"Roasted Brussels sprouts with calf's liver, pumpernickel, butternut squash, almonds, mustard vinaigrette\" which featured the taste of caramelized sprouts in spades but used the sweetness of the squash and the bitters of the pumpernickel to help tame it a bit. \u00a0With the liver providing a slightly gritty proteinacious component and the almonds a bit of crunch I was additionally happy that the mustard tones were relegated to a small supporting role, though in later bites towards the bottom of the bowl would prove a bit much for me.At this point admittedly comfortably sated but certainly not full the next two plates to arrive would prove Joshua to be quite right in his assessment of our order, the biggest capacity consumer being \"Whipped Brandade with garlic bread and chives.\" \u00a0Seemingly harmless in terms of portion but certainly not in terms of richness this take on the Provencal classic brandade de morue was simply astonishing in its careful balance of the salted cod, potatoes, whipped milk, garlic, and what I can only imagine to be an aged cheese plus olive oil. \u00a0Creamy and smooth as silk but easily a cup and half in portion and served with crispy garlic bread this was another course where I did a lot of the leg (stomach) work and although more than capable of holding my own at a dinner table this was simply a whole lot of dairy in a rather short time.For our final savory, the main course of the night would be \"Wood roasted pork shoulder with chestnut braised cabbage, parsnips, roasted apple, fresh herbs in puff pastry\" - a flavor profile no less transporting than the flavors at Next the night before as \"Pork Steak and Potatoes\" was one of my grandfather's favorite dishes to cook when he was alive. \u00a0Arriving in a large Staub pot and sizzling hot from the oven with golden pastry atop and at least half a pound of tender pork beneath the flavors in this dish were all spot on and entirely rustic without being heavy handed or clumsy in the least - a truly impressive dish and all the more so for the unique flavor of chestnuts infusing the broth and acting to foil the flavors of the cabbage.Not ready to admit defeat but certainly not in the position to consume more cheese my dining partners and I weighed the dessert options carefully and eventually settled on sharing one of the \"White chocolate panna cotta with maple figs and walnut shortbread\" three ways to see if sweets matched the savories in quality. \u00a0Generally not one to be \"wowed\" by panna cotta I will note that although small in size this particular dish did pack a lot of flavor into each bite and through such light use of chocolate the flavors each came through with aplomb, particularly the maple notes atop the sweetness of the figs. \u00a0While I personally prefer my desserts with a bit more texture this was a nice \"light\" finish to an otherwise heavy meal.", "Date": "2011-11-25", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Pack C.", "ReviewID": "BiMWmVblwTzQWmtlDeOduQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For me, the restaurant is over-rated.

Little did we realize that we happened to hit it just as they opened (right about 4pm) and made it in with no reservation and no waiting, which I hear is very unusual. Before we were done and gone there was a long line out the door with a good number of people waiting on the porch area. I must say that this place is an overall experience. You get wonderful food, plated in the perfect order by the knowledgeable staff, wonderful wine and liquor selection with talented bartenders, and an unusual social atmosphere in a well designed space. The first thing that struck us (having no clue other than a few reviews what we were getting in for) was the setup of the seating area. You are sat at a table that seats about 10 people, and you are sat with complete strangers! At first this was incredibly intimidating to a typical American with personal space issues, but after a glass of wine it turned out to be an amazing experience. The couple next to us were regulars and shared insight on the menu, wine, and the restaurant in general. They were so much fun to talk to! I was happy in the end about the unusual setup. It made great food and drink even better and more memorable. If Chicago didn't have so many great places to eat I would want to come here every time I visit! The food...oh the food. We have a wonderful selection of tapas. Every morsel was well cooked, and tasty. About 4 plates was perfect for the two of us and left room for wine and drinks. I'm not sure I was a huge fan of the spicy date dish, but it wasn't bad either. Just compared to the other great things it was so-so.

And it's not really as expensive as I was led to believe. For a party of three, with one bottle of wine, six small dishes, and one desert, it was $140 after tip. Obviously that is not dirt cheap but it's also not crazy high, given the quality of the food.My complaints come from the seating. I am not opposed to the \"group dining\" atmosphere, where you sit at large tables and are practically in direct contact with your neighbors (even if they are strangers). My main problem comes with the seating itself. The seats along the wall are very uncomfortable. You sit on a wood bench and the backrest is straight up-and-down wood. I know this looks neat and is trendy nowadays, but unfortunately that doesn't make it any more comfortable. And for the people sitting opposite the wall, they get to sit on an uncomfortable wood block with no backrest whatsoever.

Our first plate was the chorizo-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates and that was my favorite. Sometimes stronger flavors compete in a bad way, but this REALLY worked. Next we got the focaccia with taleggio cheese, which I thought was bland; the cheese was too mild for my taste. Next was the brisket with fingerling potatoes, which was so, so tender - no knife needed. VERY tasty. We finished the evening with a cheese plate, but I'm not sure which one. It was all very tasty, and I liked the marinated grapes as well as the apricot and cranberry chutney served alongside. For some reason, their quince paste (of all things) was DIVINE.

The chorizo was perfectly spicy, the date was perfectly sweet and the bacon was perfectly salty. The sauce it was in was so good we dipped everything in it. It pretty much made our trip. 2.

Pasta: \u00a0I forgot what kind of meat that was in this pasta. It might have been some sort of braised veal or something. It was sooo good. The sauce was so light with just some veggies. I remember carrots...and a wonderful lemon flavor. We licked this bowl clean. 4. Pork Shoulder: I wasn't crazy about the pork shoulder. It was good, but maybe the dates and the pasta put the bar so high that the pork shoulder just wasn't as good. It was really tender. It was hard to share with just 1 person, seeing that we were already stuffed from all of the other food. I'd skip it next time. The place is tiny....and the service and food is great.

I usually don't eat dates, but after seeing that it was a \"must try\" from so many reviews, I'm glad we ordered it. Anise-marinated hanger steak- Enjoyed this at the hotel even though it was slightly cold. The hanger steak was tender and not chewy as I was expecting it to be. Wood oven Roasted Pork Shoulder- my favorite dish from this restaurant. By the time we got back to the hotel, the ciabatta was soggy from soaking up all the juices, but it was still delicious. I wish I knew how it would have been served at the restaurant. A must!!!!The down side is the communal tables.

And Delicious. And they put crack in the red sauce. I swear.A light arugula salad with hazelnuts. Good, but not as good as Purple Pig's version.House marinated olives - a great starter... i loved all the different types of olives.Hangar steak - perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful.Burrata - who doesn't like melty and creamy mozz cheese?And a couple of the seasonal specials. So you can see we ate plenty. We were all groaning about how full we were, when we realized that we had one more dish coming to us, and that it was a LARGE plate (so was the hangar steak). We thought... \"maybe we should cancel the order if they haven't cooked it yet!\" but as soon as we said that, out comes this round, flat, crispy looking bread. And despite how full we all were, we all started salivating.The focaccia with taleggio cheese, ricotta, and truffle oil is probably at least 10 inches in diameter. Sliced in half horizontally, and slathered with cheese and drizzled with truffle oil. IT WAS PERFECTION. This dish is what I'd go back to Avec for, because despite having a lovely time, it's not quite easily accessible for me, there's not much nearby, and I prefer dishes at other tapas restaurants. But none of the other tapas restaurants has focaccia with cheese and truffle oil.Tips:We came for an early dinner. Walked right in and we were immediately seated.

As I made my way down the hall I felt very thankful to be sitting at the bar vs. one of the communal tables. I'm not anti-social or anything and actually quite enjoy communal tables (a la Purple Pig) but these tables were just too small! Very reasonably priced wines. They offer their wines in carafes so we sampled two different reds. Don't quite remember what they were called but both were recommended by our servers and both were pretty decent (in terms of taste and damage to our wallets). The food was AWESOME. Like really truly delicious flavors. Where is Avec's Michelin star??? Without realizing it, we ended up with a very pork-heavy meal: chorizo-stuffed dates, garlic sausage with some sort of chick pea salad, and the pork shoulder. We ended the meal with chocolate crepes with mascarpone and house made nutella...very tasty but I wished the crepes were warmer and that it came with some ICE CREAM!

Fortunately, we went as a group of 2 and were seated immediately.If you're not comfortable sharing a space with other people, this may not be the place for you. We were seated among a table of 6 at the table edge and when they finished their meal, we had to interrupt our dining to let them out of the booth we were sitting at. But I'm okay with that, I just charged a tariff on table movement....\"if you want to get out to go to the restroom, you give me a bit of whatever you're having.\" \u00a0=] That's what places like these are all about, creating an eating community. That's arguably the essence of \"Avec\" which means \"with\" in French, you're dining \"with\" others and your experience should be shared. It's a valuable concept that's been lost in America, which excessively elevates the value of exclusivity.The food we had was good, portions ample. Among two people you'd do good to share 4 small plates or 2 large plates or 2 small and 1 large. We went with 4 small plates for variety and were pleased with 3 out of 4.Everyone raves about the figs and it's warranted because they're really good. But I'm honestly getting a little tired of the reliance on bacon to add flavor and wrapping it around things to add panache to foods. This wouldn't have been so bad had I not noticed that they added bacon to their watercress pasta small plate, rendering what could be a good option for vegetarians obsolete. Nevertheless the watercress pasta with bacon and spring vegetable medley (asparagus, artichoke, and fava bean) was really hearty and tasty. The pasta came as a rectangular sheet, which was topped with breadcrumbs. Great texture, though would've wished to taste more of the watercress bite in the pasta.Was not happy with the cuttlefish. The cuttlefish was cooked really well, some of the most tender I've had in my life, but the flavor of the sauce it was resting in was such a let down when compared to the red bell pepper sauce of the dates.Had the beef and pork sausage as well that was served with cannelini beans. VERY flavorful, if not a little bit too salty. We had to ask for extra bread to mellow out the saltiness of the sauce it came with; then again I would've asked for more bread anyway because the bread is amazing! Freshly baked in their in-house wood-fired oven. Crispy crust \u00a0with light, airy interior. We could not resist asking for 3 small rounds throughout our meal.Dessert was innovative, offering a house chocolate candy plate in place of your usual cake/pastry. It was cardstock paper thin pieces of milk and dark chocolate peppered with crispy, sweet crumbles of feulletine (crepe flakes). An entire plate of this chocolate \"bark\" is too much for two people. It became onerous to eat, and really would have been more classy if just given as a complimentary sweet at the end of the meal, one piece per person, kind of like a fortune cookie. Service was good. Our glasses were filled with water at all times. Wine was replenished. The pacing of our meal was also good, plates given sequentially as we finished each one, despite a VERY busy service.In truth there may be some refining to be done with some of the dishes but I do love what this place represents and am anxious to see the food evolve over time.Will have to try the flatbread in the future, along with more substantial desserts.", "Date": "2010-06-04", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Mitchell P.", "ReviewID": "URLE7rnnLCTMAwysQHVjdw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After our flight arrived in Chicago, we went to Avec for Dinner. \u00a0We got there around 10pm on a Thursday night, and were seated right away as it was not too crowded. \u00a0The decor is very modern and sleek. \u00a0We ordered four plates - the chorizo stuffed dates, octopus salad, pork belly and hanger steak. \u00a0The dates and the octopus was unlike anything I have ever had. \u00a0The dates were the right amount of sweet and savory with an amazing texture. \u00a0The octopus was incredibly tender and tasted very fresh and refreshing, which was perfect after a long day. \u00a0The hanger steak was nicely cooked, but i was not a fan of the side/garnish on the plate. \u00a0Plus, the accompanying marrow tasted a lot stronger than the marrow I have had in the past (in a bad way). \u00a0The pork belly was just ok (small amount of pork belly which was overwhelmed by the other ingredients). \u00a0I forgot what beers I tried, but definitely a good selection of drinks as well. \u00a0If i had just had the dates and octopus, i would give them 5 stars, but as I was not so impressed with the other dishes, I'll give them 4 stars. \u00a0Whenever I go back to Chicago, I will definitely be picking up more of those dates!", "Date": "2011-07-27", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "A P.", "ReviewID": "oC9OiCUiTglFnpS0g157PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every dish had a rich, vibrant flavor that satisfied the taste buds.

Had I gone into this place with no expectations it would have fared better. The prices, for most things, is reasonable in comparison to other tapas-style places in Chicago, but I felt the quality of the dishes were just okay, especially after reading such raving reviews of these plates. One of the truly redeeming aspects of this restaurant though is not the design (which is great, but management, you have to fix those leaks above the women's restroom dooway!), but the service. Everyone we encountered was always smiling, we felt taken care of without feeling like they were being overbearing. They even allowed us to use a gift card we received to go toward tip, which is a stretch. So we ended up putting in more tip than standard just because they deserved it.As for the food, we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, the salmon with fava bean puree, the braised pork shoulder w/ clams and rice, and the foccacia. The bacon wrapped dates were good, but they just didn't cut it for me. They were a little too sweet and the flavors didn't seem to meld enough for me. It could have used more sauce to balance out the sweetness, but all in all it the crispy bacony goodness still made it one of the better dishes of the night. The salmon wasn't anything special, it was tender but a little overdone, and it could have used some tartness or acidity to make it more vibrant. The foccacia although was fantastic in its first bite very quickly became too rich for me to consume more than a couple pieces (it's a whole pie). The pork shoulder was probably the best of the night - the clams were briney but tender, the roast pork was just the right texture and tenderness, the rice had soaked up all the goodness of its ingredients. It was delicious. We ended the night with an amaretti cake which was a bit disappointing. The cake was pretty dry, but it was helped tremendously by the whipped cream and strawberries alongside it.

When I ordered the bartender suggested I order something else first due to the long cooking time for hangar steak. I found this curious since hangar steak is normally served rare or close to it. So I ordered the octopus with a wine pairing. I was served my white and immediately after the hangar steak arrived with it's red pairing. I set my white aside to warm while I dug into my hangar steak, and as I took my first bite the octopus arrived. Obviously this was annoying and awkward. The hangar steak was awesome, and was served with bone marrow since it's so lean.Next I ordered the whole roasted dorade. The best fish I've ever had. Unfortunately the server told me it was thoroughly de-boned, \"so dig in.\" Upon doing so I found myself with a mouth full of sharp bone. It was great though. I sucked out the eyes, cleaned the collar, scooped out the brain cavity, and even ate the tail. I finished with an assortment of Italian cheese, and the \u00a0white chocolate dessert.

First off, the atmosphere is very interesting. You're literally dining in a wooden box... not in a bad way, but the entire interior is made out of wood. My friend and I were seated promptly at the edge of a table (there's communal seating here) and we were the only ones at the table at the time. Our server gave us some recommendations off of the menu and since we weren't terribly hungry, we ordered a small plate of the roasted whitefish ($13) and the roasted pork shoulder ($21). A few minutes later a couple was seated at the other end of our table. So thankfully we weren't starving because our food took a long time to come out. I started to think that they forgot about us because the couple that came after us got their food long before we did. The roasted whitefish came out first and I thought it tasted fantastic. It was cooked to perfection and the veggies under it went very nicely with the fish. The roasted pork shoulder probably came out 15-20 minutes after we finished with the fish which I thought was unusually long. In the meantime while we were waiting, they seated a party in the middle of the table which I thought was kind of awkward to ask people who were already dining to get up and let people in. I didn't really mind but I could see how some people would mind if they were in the middle of dining. So when the pork shoulder finally came out, it appeared to be stew-like. The meat fell off the bone with ease, it was very flavorful, and the portion was very generous. After a while though the flavor was starting to get boring because it was the only thing at our table. It would've been nice to have a couple dishes at the same time so you can mix up the different flavors in your mouth. On top of that, I felt the service was lacking. Avec didn't seem very welcoming at all since our server just took our order and brought us our bill.

We decided we wanted to take her some place nice for letting us stay at her place and showing us around all weekend. I was hoping to make it to Alinea, but i was too slow trying to get a reservation, so that will have to wait for a future trip. She'd already been to the famous Frontera Grill, so that was off the list too. We decided something mellow and laid back would be good, and i remember Tony Bourdain mentioning Avec in one of his books as one of his favorite places in Chicago that had great food, but none of the other crap you have to deal with at fine dining restaurants. They don't do reservations. We showed up around 8pm on a saturday night (probably not the best idea) and ended up having to wait just over an hour for a table. The place is very small, modern architecture, with obvious Japanese influences (geometric shapes, simple design, light wood, communal seating, etc) in the design of the restaurant, not the food. The food is mostly french, spanish, italian inspired small plates. So here's what we got:House Marinated Olives - even though these were just olives, they we ridiculously good. Really soft with lots of meat. Really delicious. Avec Salad - Really nice. Nothing too flashy or exciting, just a really nice, delicious, perfectly dressed salad. Pot Roast - This was done kind of vietnamese style with carrots and cilantro. It was really good and a twist on a traditionally delicious but kind of ho-hum dish that screams 1950's suzy home maker. This was certainly unlike most pot roast dishes. Focaccia - Basically two super thin pizza crusts sandwiched together with taleggio cheese, truffle oil, and herbs. Again, very simple, and oh so delicious. Chorizo Stuffed Dates Wrapped in Smoked Bacon and Served in Piquillo Pepper Tomato Sauce - This was easily the star of the show. These little nuggets of joy had me about to pee in my pants. The heat of the sauce and the charizo, the smokiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the date, all wrapped into a little nugget of modest, no frills, mind blowing deliciousness. No super trendy and expensive gimmicky ingredients like foie gras, wagyu beef or truffles, just wonderful. Most dishes we ordered came with home made bread that was great. The servers were tattooed and casual enough to not be stuffy, but not obnoxiously alternative. Our waitress was just about perfect, we tipped very well. Not only was the food and the service fantastic, but for three people (granted, we didn't order wine), we all left stuffed, and the total before tip was under $60.

Here are a few of my observations.The atmosphere is something to be either appreciated or loathed. While some liken the wood panels to a 'sauna,' I find it a refreshingly clean and non-disrupting backdrop to the food experience. The community dining aspect is also something that some can find abrasive -- it isn't for everyone -- but when experienced with an open mind, I think it's only positive to be able to relate to others about the plates, cheeses and wine. You learn and experience more than what's just in front of you, and isn't that what \"Avec\" (with) is all about?The service was attentive, knowledgeable, but also casual and unpretentious. The servers seem genuinely excited by the food and were generous when it came to sampling different wines before ordering them.

It got a little cramped when we were waiting for our table. However, they worked with the space that they had. The decor and the ambiance really complimented the restaurant. We were seated at a communal table and I've noticed that communal tables are on the rise. I don't really know how I feel about this situation just because I like my breathing room (only child syndrome). But, I guess, it does save a lot of space and it's a plus if you have cool neighbors. On the other hand, it can be disastrous if your neighbors are staring you down with confusion because all you can do is nod and moan simultaneously to your friends, pointing at the dish that just changed your life. Luckily, our pretentious neighbors left and I was back in my zone, just eating. And nodding. Don't judge me, you know you do the same. Holler back. What what.Of course, we ordered everything we desired on the menu. We started off with the small plates: the signature chorizo stuffed dates and the wood-fired squid dish. The tastes of the charred smoky bacon with the sweet dates go hand in hand and I was thoroughly impressed with the fusion of flavors. \u00a0The squid dish was my absolute favorite small dish. The squid was cooked to perfection, the tomatoes were fresh, and the fennel was crunchy but not too crunchy. Everything went perfectly together. On to the big plates that we ordered: the whole roasted fish with fennel seed, wood-oven roasted pork shoulder, wood-fire flatbread with tuna, and half chicken roasted with pomegranate and asparagus. My favorite main dish was definitely the whole roasted fish. I died. The skin of the fish was crunchy and slightly salty. The fish itself was extremely moist. \u00a0The pork shoulder was tender and the beans added flavor to the dish. The flatbread was mediocre. It was not my favorite for the mere fact that the taste of the tuna was extremely prominent. Lastly, the half chicken plate was absolutely great. The chicken was moist and the pomegranate went so well with the dish. The combination was to die for. You didn't think we stopped there did you? Of course not. I would never walk out of a restaurant without cleaning my palette with something sweet, even if I was dying from being overstuffed. There is always a compartment for desserts. Therefore, I ordered the cappuccino paired with the hazelnut crumb cake and the housemade chocolate crisps. Everything was divine. The crumb cake was not too sweet and the hazelnuts were the icing on the cake, literally. The crisps were thin and just delightful.

They didn't take reservations, so the wait was maybe an hour (we arrived at 9pm).

I've always wondered if chefs enjoy having patrons chatting them up while they're trying to do their job. If the chef at Avec wasn't interested, he certainly didn't make it known. He was friendly, answered all our questions, and kept us engaged and happy. And all the while, he made food for everyone in the restaurant, all of it looking pretty spectacular!

I'd say all were tremendous except the focaccia bread. It was much too large for two people (from the large plate menu, we should've paid more attention), and it was served after the other dishes since it took longest to bake. So by the time it was delivered, we were quite full and not interested in having what felt more like an appetizer-type dish. On the other hand, the other dishes were spectacular. My non-vegetable-loving BF was quite keen on the brussels sprouts salad, that says a lot on its own.

Taste was definitely helped by some chard that was snuck in there.Pork shoulder ended up as the real star. Firstly, this was a massive portion - when some of my coworkers came a few weeks ago they shared this amongst four of them. The dish came with some amazing local carrots and served with a basil pistou (basically French pesto without nuts), which cut through the savory meatiness in a perfect way. Not known to be When I was about halfway through the dish, I felt full and considered stopping. However, the diminishing return on the shoulder was so low - the light jus kept the remainder hot, and I felt as if I just started eating a new dish! If I weren't stuffed from downing the full pork shoulder, I would have certainly taken aim at the panna cotta.

Not memorable.

Also kind of cold. Nutter butters--an okay dessert. if you like peanut butter, the flavor is all peanut butter. A kind of gourmet butterfinger-like-thing. Nice idea, but textures weren't all that interesting. One-note.Chocolate cocotte--the person I was eating with had this. They liked it, but again, were not terribly impressed. I tried a bite and thought it was good but just kind of a lot of a strong chocolate flavor without any interesting dimensions. The kind of chocolatey dessert you get anywhere.

I'm not sure if he was trying to make up for some terrible insecurity based on upholding an image of refinement and casual bearded sophistication that he felt was constantly in danger of slipping away...? Whatever was going on he was really unpleasant to deal with. He snottily recommended against white wine (which the person I was eating with wanted), noting \"you don't really look like you drink red wine, but what you ordered really calls for red wine\" very haughtily. If we decided against recommendations he seemed very judgmental (my dining companion doesn't like cumin, which he kind of narrowed his eyes and nodded at drily). All of the things he did (recommending a different wine, etc) could be done kindly and pleasantly, but he seemed like he was trying to make us feel out of place and awkward.The other two servers (a kind Black-Beard #2, and a nice quiet water pourer) were pleasant and attentive.Also, the atmosphere was not great--really loud, very crowded from people waiting for seats.

These were no other options or offers to make something other than bread or plain lettuce. For the bread I did eat, I wasn't blown away. It wasn't bad by any means, but it was very expensive and very salty. As I said, I was with a group, and the rest of them ate various dishes. Including me and my friend who only ate the foccacia, the bill averaged to $46 per person. That's insane! Someone had two drinks, but I stuck with water, as did two others, and the others had one drink at most. I was definitely underwhelmed. I went in wanting to like it, because I had heard so many good things, but I ended up feeling like living the Emperor's New Clothes. Salty, overpriced, and noisy. The one thing I will say was really positive (and thus the two stars) was that the desserts were pretty good.

This meal was better, I believe.I came here on a Saturday night at 5:40 and I was worried because of the no reservation policy that I would have to wait quite a while. They seated me immediately. Very pleased with that. I was sat at the long bar which was nice (you were able to see the chefs prepare the food a little bit), but the seats got uncomfortable about 30 minutes into the meal. No biggie.After having a good amount of time to look at the menu I decided to order the Chorizo stuffed dates and the whipped brandade at the same time. The dates came out first.This was the first time I have ever had dates, I didn't know what to expect but based on the reviews of these babies I was confident. They were AMAZING! I thought of ordering them again but I wanted to continue to try new things. They had a little sweetness, and a little spiciness. They were also a little smokey \u00a0because of the chorizo. The only complaint I have with the dish is that I wish I had a little more sauce so I could use the bread to sop it up.The brandade came out once I was about to eat my last date so I was pleased with the fact that I didn't have to wait for it. I have never had salt cod before so again I didn't know what to expect. It was really tasty though, probably my favorite thing of the night. I don't really know how to explain it but it was creamy and rich with a nice fish flavor. The bread that came out didn't have its own flavors that over powered the fish spread but it was good bread that was grilled nicely. It had a nice chew, was crispy on the crust, and has a smokey char flavor. Makes me wish they served that quality of bread at Blackbird next door.As I was about to finish the brandade, I ordered the small plate hanger steak. The amount of time it took to come out was quite long and I thought about taking one star off of my rating but when the plate of food came, the flavors were well worth the wait. Very tender steak cooked medium rare to rare. The balsamic and basil mustard added a little bit of heat to the dish that was nice (it was a horseradish type heat). The grapefruit added a beautiful citrus flavor to the plate that I loved. I only wish there was another segment of the grapefruit because I almost ran out when I was eating the last piece of steak (and I don't even like grapefruit!).I finished the meal with their seasonal sorbet which was lemon and it came with two small, and fragile sugar cookies. Maybe the best sugar cookies i've ever had!I definitely recommend going with someone because I went by myself and these three small plates were almost too much for me. What I ate could have fed two people who were moderately hungry. The price was real good. With no drinks (just water) and including tax and tip I spent $50. I would recommend this place to everyone and hope to be back soon when I celebrate my birthday with my parents later this week!Quick edit: One thing that was a bit tricky was finding the door to the place. I walked down into the little entrance/alley area thing and saw a door in front of me. I tried to open it but was locked (it was a private entrance). I then went to the front of the restaurant and looked at the front of it to see if there was a door but there wasn't. Went back and saw a wooden door that blended in well with its surroundings.

Am very glad, because all four of us really enjoyed the London Calling cocktail - a mix of gin, Pimms, ginger, and cucumber soda - to the point where we all got seconds. I also insisted on trying their semi-famous endive and crispy potato salad with a poached egg on top (the potato is shaped into a basket, the server cuts it up for you!), which I really enjoyed. Blackbird was lovely, but a little posh for us.Note: as I travelled between restaurants - they're separated by a small alleyway - a large rat ran across my foot. Don't be alarmed - if I were a rat living in Chicago, I'd hang out in Blackbird's dumpster, too. Plus, it reminded me of home, as Australia has rats the size of their ancestral ship denizens.Finally we were called to our table at avec. The crowd was 90% hipster, and jumping. Our server was lovely, and recommended excellent cheeses for the platter (with honeycomb, and quince jelly), and a good red wine. The dishes, however, were a bit hit and miss. Here's a rundown of ones that were memorable, both good and bad: \"deluxe\" foccacia - server recommended, and my favourite dish of the night. Crispy, salty, creamy. It was addictive. The bacon/chorizo stuffed dates, another signature dish, were merely okay (a bit sad, because I was really excited to try it). I ordered the burrata with eggplant and mushroom, which I enjoyed. The Husband ordered the pork shoulder cassoulet, and it was universally loved. However, my chicken dish - which I anticipated as being homey, warming, comforting - was both odd and universally *unloved*. The chicken itself was pronounced in its cumin affliction, and otherwise bland (Tom Colicchio would deduce serious points for lack of seasoning). The rice was a bit gluggy, instead of crispy. Supremely disappointing. We ordered virtually half the menu, although I'm struggling to recall what else...ah! The pear and quinoa salad was yummy, and I enjoyed the roasted leek bruschetta, too. We also ordered the entire dessert menu - hey, there were 4 of us! - and I loved the affagato best, although the orange upside down cake was delightfully moist and tasty. By that point we were stuffed and poor, but couldn't shake the feeling that we'd had...better.And we had.

Came here with my husband per our usual date night on a Saturday night and were supposed to arrive around 6pm and hope for a decent wait time, but plans changed and we got there around 5:15pm which was perfect since we got sat right away. The whole communal dining experience isn't ideal for date night and my husband is def. not a fan of that, so we probably should have sat at the bar since there were a few empty seats. By 5:30pm, the place was jam packed and at least a half an hour wait, so timing is key at this place. Since we were literally on top of our neighbors, on both sides of us, we got to see that everyone pretty much orders the focaccia and the dates and so we ordered both since there was just two of us and a few of their beers. Beers were alright, nothing note worthy even getting the Italian ones. The focaccia came out first and it was a okay, we both thought it was tasty, but a bit bland for us, so I would have to agree with some of the other reviews so at this point my Avec experience is a okay to even I've experienced better point, but wait, wait, everything CHANGED when we received the chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped, mejdool dates in that spicy red sauce served with hot bread. WOW, that was one of the best things I\"ve ever eaten, my two star experience suddenly went up to four stars because, they were amazing. Just get them, don't think twice, in fact get a portion just for yourself because they are just that good. Perfect combination of sweet, salty, spicy and mouth-watering goodness. We thoroughly enjoyed them and I may just come back at off peak times, sit at the bar, by myself if I have to, and order those dates!! They make Avec what it is today, if it wasn't for that menu item, I would really doubt the success of the place.

Before we left though, I asked the chef at the restaurant I worked at where I should go eat in Chicago, whereupon laughed at me and said \"Alinea, obviously.\" and then proceeded to tell me about Avec. I was a little skeptical at first since I always feel awkward going into a place that is geared towards alcohol when I'm not 21, but I figured I would give it a shot. So after fifteen hours of driving we finally get to the restaurant, only to have to wait for half an hour at 11PM. That's how busy this place is. The restaurant itself is really beautiful, a stark contrast to the minimalist white Blackbird next door. The communal aspect of dining combined with the wood paneling gives the place a really cozy warm feel, something you don't find in a lot of ultra-trendy/hip places. It is a little loud though, and we had to shout across the table at times to keep up the conversation. Also, while communal dining is pretty cool in that someone offered us their food after they were too full to finish it, having people dip their fingers into the salt and pepper was not. And I hope you don't mind people listening into your conversations because that's bound to happen as well. But the food. The food was deliciously amazing. Like I said, we had just gotten finished a car ride that took us halfway across the country, so we were all hungry and tired (especially after that wait). The food did not disappoint. Everything was so heavy and rich and just full of flavor. Despite the fact that nothing here is conventional, it all felt like comfort food. The \"deluxe\" focaccia was one of the best dishes I've had in a while. The cheese inside of it was so creamy and savory, and the bit of truffle oil in it gave it that earthy smell that made it an olfactory wonderland. Our group got the focaccia and flatbread to share. The flatbread was a little on the salty side, the olives and the relatively strong (but delicious!) cheese contributing to that. I personally got the dates since I heard so much about them on the site. While the sweet and spicy flavors were an interesting mix, I really wasn't all the impressed by it. The spiciness of the chorizo really overpowered a lot of the other flavors I thought. Maybe if it weren't so spicy it would have been better. It was a good dish, but I think the praise that it's getting is a little much. It was really filling though, a heavy dish, which was nice. Someone else in the group got the asparagus crostini, and she described the red bean hummus as one of the best she's ever had.Like I said earlier, the dishes here are all really rich and really filling. After eating a few pieces of the focaccia and a piece of flatbread, I was almost full and could barely stuff down three of the dates. But I loved that, everything just had so much flavor and was perfect for a bunch of tired hungry people late at night. I wish I felt as content and happy after every meal like I did after Avec. The price isn't bad too. For four people to the check came out to around 80 dollars, and we all left with full stomachs.

Well... I'll just add to the fire I guess.I went here last night for a birthday dinner. I spoke with the hostess the day before to see when the best time to arrive would be because of hearing about long wait times and such. She said anytime before 7pm would be okay. We show up at around 6:45pm... there was a wait. It wasn't long though. About 15 minutes, if that. We had a carafe of sparkling rose to keep us company so it was just fine.We got seated at the bar (which the hostess had told me earlier would be the best spot to eat if it was just going to be the two of us), ordered another carafe of champagne, and perused the menu. We had asked the bartender/server what his recommendations were. He said the dates are a must (of coarse), the walleye (whitefish on the menu), and the chicken. Yes, yes, and yes please!Chorizo stuffed dates with smoked bacon and pepper and tomato sauce - everyone has explained these little love bombs to a T so I'm not going to go much further. I was told that everything is made in-house; the chorizo, bacon,... the guy even told us they have a little date tree in the basement (he had a real good sense of humor).Walleye/whitefish - tender walleye in a broth with lemon. So good!!! I think there might have been some sort of parsley salad of something on top of it. It was pretty damn good.Roasted chicken with chimichuri, chickpeas, squash, cauliflower and shaved haricot vert - This was good, but not the best thing we had that evening. Great flavor! Tasted very Moroccan which I wasn't expecting, but it was a nice surprise.Overall, I had a great time here. Yes, it was packed. Yes, it was loud. But when I could ask for any recommendation from our bartender/waiter and the \"wine guy\" at any given \u00a0moment, that's a plus in my book. It's worth whatever hassle that you have to deal with.", "Date": "2010-06-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Roam and H.", "ReviewID": "Qr-evRAtgaDOunn71fsP_g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Avec is our [especially mine] all time favorite Chicago Restaurant. They don't take reservations, so if you arrive with a group, be prepared for a wait, or get there closer to opening time to avoid long waits. We usually head here as a two-top and like to sit at the bar, but no matter where you sit this place is 'communal' and 'close quarters' and you will like share conversations with those around you, another reason why we like this place. We have met some really interesting and fun people here.The food is obviously the big draw card. Thank-goodness they treat their staff well as Chef de Cuisine Koren Grieveson is the secret sauce, she has provided the magic from the start and I hope she is the main-stay for years to come. \u00a0The menu has been a revolving & consistent menu. Revolving in that they do different seasonal takes on several staple dishes providing the consistency. There is always a 'crostini' to be found, and when we were there it consisted off \u00a0smashed early spring peas, red onion, parsley & marinated feta in red wine - delicious. People go crazy for the 'chorizo-stuffed medjool dates' with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce, they do taste good, but there are so many other things that we are typically drawn to.The menu also features a whole fish at MP [market price], a salad, some seasonal vegetables and a dessert or two as a special. The dressing they use on their salad is so drool worthy we asked for the recipe, all we got was a list of what went into it. That was three years ago we are still trying to get the balance right - we are almost there, not that a few more trips to Avec won't help. A few other faves to try that we also like are the: focaccia with taleggio cheese, truffle oil and fresh herbs; any salad that is shaved be it fennel or brussel sprouts; and of course the bread fresh & hot from the wood oven. Did I mention they have a great wine list? They offer up an interesting selection of European wines.The 'pork shoulder' also a staple on the menu comes in some form or another. This visit it was a wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with harissa, marinated rock shrimp, hominy, peanuts and tomatillo. It is always moist & succulent and packed with interesting flavors & textures to round out the dish. It is huge and filling, although it looks small - trust us. The other fave dish to order is the 'prosciutto' also always seasonal in flavor the current version is a la quercia prosciutto with lavender mascarpone and coriander. As an insiders tip, this is listed on menu as large plates, if you ask nicely they will serve it up as a 1/2 portion. Truly fabulous. Thanks Avec.

Although only being here once, I thought I had a good handle on the place. Perhaps I thought wrong. The food is still outstanding and is always fun to share and enjoy with a wonderful friend or even a small group. Penny and I got to sit at the bar, this time. The menu changes slightly for each season. Some dishes get modified, some get changed completely and others remain their tried and true selves. We were able to sample some of each tonight and of course what we had left smiles and happy faves on each of our faces. Starting with a glass of wine from their large and simply jaw dropping wine list, we descended on to the menu. What to get... what to get... \u00a0we went in on two different rounds and 6 different plates. We went in our first round the chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped dates, really a must when ever you come here. 4 of these bad boys placed in a roasted red pepper sauce. Amazing stuff. Feel free to take the crusty bread and get lusty with the sauce. I mean that's what it is there for. Then we move on to the prosciutto, pear and manchego cheese. Light with a hint of citrus from lemons, smokiness from the prosciutto, blended well with the sweetness of the pear and the richness of the olive oil and cheese. As well as the deluxe focaccia with taleggio cheese, truffle oil and fresh herbs. Think of it like this. Crispy warm flat bread that nestles and cradles soft warm cheese that just melts in your mouth. It explodes with the richness of the truffle oil and sings harmonic praises of heaven with the herbs. This is my kind of carb loading. Our second round we went with the special of rapini sauteed in olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and a little lemon. The bitterness of the rapini comes toward the middle to the end of the mouthful, as Penny put it, kinda like horseradish, but the olive oil and garlic make the presence known in the beginning. Savor the mouthful. We did since we got one of the last plates of it. Then we got the Avec salad. Butter and red oak lettuce cradles the creamy avocados and roasted tomato dressing, along with red onions and radishes. If you threw some chicken or seared tuna on there I'd be eating that every day. We got a little adventurous and went with the duck dish they had that day. It was a little rich, but certainly our glasses of wine helped to cut through. Slice of warm toasty baguette with a little olive oil, then spooning cool pulled duck, seasoned and filled with the rich duck fat. Certainly this is not an every day dish, but one to savor and experience once in a while. There is the bar and three long tables and that is it, its communal seating. You might be sitting next to a couple from out of town or just down the street. They may have come from the theatre or from the Bears game. If you want privacy, don't expect it here. You should just go, grab a good friend, enjoy the very friendly and on top of their game servers and staff, savor the food and enjoy a great glass of wine.

They don't take reservations so we made sure that we arrived. I walked in and loved the look of the place. Given that it was wood panel walls, wooden tables, wooden seats, and just wood everything. It was simple and clean and exactly what I liked. We were seated right away and everyone was really friendly and helpful with describing the menu. We ordered chorizo stuffed dates because we were told that it was very popular, local apple salad, and seared sturgeon. We started off with the apple salad. Now, when I saw apple salad I thought it was fresh greens with slices of apples. So I was slightly wrong. It was a salad of apples. Ok, I was just wrong. I liked the apple salad because I love apples. The salad consisted of green apples, manchego cheese, and apple cider. The apple was tart but sweetened with the cider and I love the nutty taste from the manchego. The dates came out and I didn't even know they were dates because they were huge and stuffed with spicy chorizo. Dates stuffed with chorizo, bacon, and tomato sauce. Really can't go wrong. It was really good. You had the sweetness from the date that paired with a kick of spiciness of the chorizo made it a very enjoyable dish. The seared sturgeon was cooked just right leaving the meat tender and juicy. We finished the meal with chocolate crepes with mascarpone and house made nutella. Very simple and very good. The nutella was a bit runny. I prefer it being thicker so that I can plop a spoon of it onto each bite of my crepe. The overall meal was delicious. Great food and lots of fresh ingredients with fabulous service. I would definitely go back if in town to try something new since the menu changes according to seasonal ingredients.

Behind the bar/table was the kitchen where all your wonder aromas originated from. You didn't crowd me because of your high ceilings. I saw that you kept yourself clean, simple and made of wood from the ceiling, walls and floor which really made you even more attractive. You started to flirt with me with your Tuna spread (accompanied with a half boiled egg) which was so creamy. It was perfectly seasoned and when I smeared on the toasted bread, I was almost in bliss. You then tickled me with the chicken liver dish! \u00a0I love chicken liver and I think you knew it because the way you cooked it with the endive (which was perfectly cooked with a hint of bitterness), the flaolet beans (firm and soft) and the vinaigrette was in complete harmony with each other. At this point, I had a feeling you were trying to seduce me with the marinate hanger steak with roasted shallots and brussel sprouts salsa verde. The hanger steak was so tender and the added flavors of the shallots and salsa only indicated that it was going to be a fun night. Well that and the second bottle of white wine (2009 P. Mas, \"Claude Val\")! Who knew that brussel sprouts (soft in texture) would go so well with a hanger steak? The marinated steak was salty but, the salsa helped even out the flavor. I guess you thought I still wasn't convinced that you were into me because you came out with the strip bass with harissa, tahini and romaine hearts. \u00a0The fish meat was so soft and tender that it flaked off as I tried to eat it. I can't remember all of the flavors but it was so appetizing. This dish was orgasmic! \u00a0I felt I needed a coffee after all of that sensual food action. So you brought out a Caf\u00e9 avec which was a 1 oz espresso and 1 oz Leopold Gourmel Cognac. I've never had this combination in my life but I enjoyed it so. Our one night together was erotic and I'm not sure when I'll be back.

There was no wait. We were immediately seated right next to a couple who were on their \"official first date.\" How do I know this? Because you're literally rubbing shoulders with your neighbors..the restaurant has communal table seating. We did not know this until we got there and I thought to myself \"how Benihana-esque.\" It was pretty awkward listening to the guy trying to flirt with his date. He was corny as hell. I mean it was really difficult for me to eat because I was cracking up in my head. \u00a0Literally, I was snickering to myself, hoping they didn't see me laughing at them. Not to mention, it was difficult to hold a conversation because of the close distance to other people who are holding their own conversations. I wasn't sure if I should have joined the couple's conversation or texted my boyfriend in order to communicate with him. I also wasn't sure if it would have been okay to try our neighbors' food haha.With that said, the place is quaint and simple. You could google image search \u00a0the place if you wanna see how it looks. It's a small place, almost everything is made up of wood except for the back wall stocked with glass bottles--well thought out touch! You could eat at the bar. The chairs reminded me of kahon drum boxes. The bench was made of wood as well. I think the point is for your ass to be uncomfortable so that you could eat and leave right away since it's a small place and that would shorten the wait lines. I have never dined in a place like this before. I appreciated the design.The food we ordered was excellent! We had the wood-fired flatbread with tuna, mozzarella, tomatoes, and watercress. This was like a pizza. At first I didn't know that it was tuna and thought they were anchovies. The concept seemed similar. However, it was beautiful and delicious! The colors, taste, light and fresh vegetables, and flatbread were spot on! We also had the sunchoke crostini with salmon roe, breakfast radish, and brown butter. This was the highlight of my dining experience. I love salmon roe to begin with, and the only way I've had it was in temaki or sushi. So this was a pleasant surprise for me. I was in heaven for a little bit. It was pretty grand. The presentation, the textures, the different elements, and the overall taste pushed me over the edge. Great plate!!!We also ordered the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce. I didn't read the description when we ordered. I just saw the words \"dates\" and \"bacon\" and immediately nodded. I'm a big fan of bacon-wrapped dates and thought, \"Okay you could never go wrong with them.\" But this placed killed it. And not \"killed it\" like \"it was to die for.\" I mean killed it as in \"ruined the dish\" and \"messed up my perception of bacon-wrapped dates forever.\" Honestly, does the recipe call for one whole shaker of salt? The chorizo/sausage/longaniza was ehhh. I felt that the meat and sauce were overpowering. It tasted like salty spaghetti sauce and meatballs. I couldn't take any more bites. I removed the chorizo and sauce off my plate and just ate the dates and bacon. I thought that bacon was supposed to give the \"salty\" taste on the dish but apparently this was not the case--the sauce and chorizo did. Oh and my boyfriend didn't even know there were dates stuffed in the meat. That's how overpowering it was! And last, we had the crispy whitefish with pistachio puree, marinated beets, and grapefruit. It was a-ok. It was a unique combination of different textures and tastes. I was a bit confused. The whitefish was cooked to the tee. I loved the soft meat of the fish and the crisp outer layer on the sides. YUM! The puree was excellent with the fish! I didn't understand the beets. It brought out a metallic taste and reminded me of canned cranberry. I only had a few bites of that. And the grapefruit was a nice touch to the combination. It had that bittersweet taste and brought out the flavor of the dish overall. Yay!Another thing...I wasn't that pleased with the service. A lady took our order. Another lady gave us our bill. One busboy changed our plates and silverware. Another busboy brought out our food. Another busboy refilled our waters. It's great to see they work as a team but who does our tip go to? I was hoping it went to our busboys because they were really serving us hand and foot, while the ladies didn't do that much work. It seemed like they were just standing around. There was even a time when I asked for something to the lady who was just standing there doing nothing, and she ordered a busboy to do it. =(Truth: If you want privacy when you converse, this is not the place.

Undoubtably, Avec has some outstanding, very creative dishes from stictly a culinary standpoint. However, I have to say that after the last experience I had with them, I will definitely never go back. 1) Waiting approx 1+ hrs for a table is ridiculous. The food is good, but it isnt that good. There are no pre-reservations and you have to show up at the restaurant, and then make a reservation for 1+ hrs. Whoever owns this place is off their rocker full of themselves. The food at Avec is excellent, but it wont last in the long run provided the reasons below2) The waitstaff are prentetious and act like they are something they are not. Very rude and inattentive! I normally always tip 20%, but after the treatment I received last time I went to Avec, I actually made it a point to tip $0. I'm not sure what they are going for (NY or something), but rude and attitude do not work in Chicago, we are nice people3) The lighting in Avec is so bright (to try and increase its turnover and get people from staying long periods of time at the table) that I felt I was on Broadway or something. Nobody is perfect of course but I definitely dont want people to see all my imperfections under a makeup lamp (I'm a straight male too)4) Packed like cattle. Tables are packed in like sardines. I personally do not want anyone rubbing up against me while I'm eating or ease-dropping in on my conversation but at Avec, you're gonna be sure it's guaranteed to happen. So, watch what you say otherwise the table brushing up right next to you is going to make fun of everything you say5) Food is Avec's saving grace. Excellent and creative, but for the prices, there are many other places to choose from without the rest of the poor treatment and nonsense of being treated like a child in the cafeteria.6) Sum: Avec is more about making money than pleasing the customer. Very disappointing since the food is so good and the restaurant vision has so much great potential.

The bartender was super knowledgeable about picking something based on my vague preferences, and the hour pretty much flew by. I really love the way this restaurant wraps you in wood - everything from the floor, walls, ceiling, to even the long benches and stools, is in warm wood tones, except for one wall crafted entirely of beautifully lit glass bottles. This makes communal dining and even the stark lighting a little friendlier. When we finally settled into our seats, we wanted food, and wanted it quick. After a once-over of the menu, we ordered a half dozen plates. They arrived pretty fast, in no particular order, and were all phenomenal. The cauliflower-garlic crostini had a great interplay of textures, the gnocchi with mustard greens was delish, the cod and chicken thigh were cooked perfectly, the taleggio and herb stuffed foccacia was addictive, and even the olives seemed better than usual.

I would be willing to give it another try. I think the issue was that my dining partner picked out all the items for us that night and passed up suggestions I made that I thought I'd like. Nonetheless, I wasn't impressed as I know all before me have been.When we got there around 830 on a weeknight, we actually had no wait! We were off to a good start. I'm not a fan of this type of seating where you are two inches away from the couple next to you but it seems that's a theme at Paul Kahan's restaurants (cue Publican & Blackbird). Our waitress was super duper nice so points for that.I came from a Sake tasting so was already in a spirited mood, I ordered a beer once sitting down at Avec. They were out of the first beer I ordered so I then went with Cerveja Sagres.We started with the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce for $9. So many friends have told me how amazing the dates are and the friend I was with couldn't stop gushing about them before we arrived. I took one bite and my mouth was on fire. I'm admittedly very weak with spicy food but it was so strong on the dates that not only could I not taste any of the actual flavor to them but I couldn't taste any flavor at all in my next dish either. I was not into the dates at all and definitely will not get them again. We also got the Avec bread when we sat down and that was very fluffy & light, loved it. For our second plate, we got the marinated hanger steak with puy lentils, melted bone marrow, spinach, tomato, oranges and fried capers for $14. As I said, I really couldn't taste any flavor due to the dates but what I did taste was just mediocre. I was excited about this because who doesn't love bone marrow!? But alas, I was let down with it. For our third plate, \u00a0we got the wood-oven roasted pork shoulder with braised chestnuts and cabbage, parsnips and roasted apple for $21. This was the best dish of the night and I liked it but was not blown away. The pork was in a miso type of broth and by now I was able to taste flavor a bit again! For dessert we got the housemade chocolate crisps for $9. My favorite candy bar is a Crunch bar and this was like homemade giant sheets of Crunch bar! It was my personal favorite of the night plus it came in milk & dark chocolate!

\u00a0The only slight negative about the atmosphere was that it was pretty loud. \u00a0Put a lot of people in a small space and I guess that's what happens!Our server suggested that for two people, we should order 3-4 dishes. \u00a0Since I always try to sample as many things as possible, we went with four. \u00a0We ordered the chorizo-stuffed dates (of course!), the hangar steak, the pork shoulder, and the focaccia bread. \u00a0Out first were the dates, which were my main reason for choosing this restaurant. \u00a0Being Canadian and a lover of Food Network, I've seen \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" many times and wished I could go to the restaurants they suggested. \u00a0And finally, there I was! \u00a0I'm not a big fan of dates usually, but these were fantastic. \u00a0Chorizo inside, bacon wrapped around them...what's not to love. \u00a0They were served in a lovely tomato-based sauce that was a perfect accompaniment. \u00a0I wished there were more than four! \u00a0Next came the focaccia. \u00a0A creamy cheese, fresh herbs, truffle oil...it was heavenly. \u00a0Unfortunately, it was also huge - about the size of a regular pizza. \u00a0We felt terrible that we couldn't finish it, but we knew we still had two dishes to come. \u00a0It started to dawn on us that perhaps the server had misguided us. \u00a0We probably would have been fine if we'd ordered three small dishes and one large, but we'd gone half and half, again based on her recommendation. \u00a0Really though, I can't complain when food tastes that good.The hangar steak was probably our favourite. \u00a0So flavourful and juicy, it was just absolutely delicious. \u00a0It came out pre-sliced which made it easy to share. \u00a0They cleared our dishes before the pork came out, and when it did we wondered why they hadn't left us our steak knives. \u00a0We only had our forks, and a spoon was in the dish of pork. \u00a0Very confused, I picked up the spoon - and the pork melted beneath it. \u00a0This was the most tender pork I'd ever eaten. \u00a0I didn't find that there was a lot of flavour, especially in the top parts that weren't in the juice, but it was still pretty good. \u00a0All in all, delicious food, and a nice but loud atmosphere. \u00a0I would probably try something new if I were to go back to Chicago, but that says more about the culinary options in the city than it does the restaurant. \u00a0I would definitely recommend it to anyone taking a trip there.", "Date": "2011-08-29", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "Jessica M.", "ReviewID": "GpA1AWDZeYXPqliThcKdQg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought Avec was a really nice break from normal dining. \u00a0They don't take reservations (or at least, we didn't have one), so we checked in wtih the hostess and headed to Blackbird for a drink. \u00a0Because they're sibling restaurants, you can hang at the bar at Blackbird, and Avec will call over and say when your table is ready. \u00a0Really convenient!

We decided we would just pass everything around and enjoy - well - except for the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates, which we ordered one per couple (and definitely were not sad about). I do not have one bad thing to say about anything. We had a hard time even picking favorite. Unfortunately I have waited too long to post and can't give a list of recommendations, so I will give a very general (but hopefully still helpful) recommendation: come very very hungry, with a large group of people, order absolutely everything that catches your eye, be sure to share, and enjoy!", "Date": "2010-03-17", "Author_Location": "Lisle, IL"}, {"Author": "Chris B.", "ReviewID": "-DWfnXdyzO11riG6_eb2xA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having read numerous reviews about Avec in national magazines over the last 2 years, I can say without a doubt that the hype was right on target.

I chose Avec since I'd read that their counter and common-table seating would be suitable for a single diner. Sure enough, I walked right past a line of guests waiting on the sidewalk for seats and was seated in the single empty chair at the counter. Even before seeing a menu, I was excited about the meal thanks to the vibe of the restaurant, smells coming from the open (tiny) kitchen, and smiles on diners' faces.I was pleased to see Campari at the small bar, and started out with a serving on the rocks. I ordered the leek bruschetta, which came out quickly and was fantastic. I ordered a glass of wine from their decent wine list, but was told that they were out of that bottle. I took a substitution which was great. I saw the smoked edwards surryano ham on the menu, and asked my waiter for a 1oz portion of the ham by itself rather than the ham dish on the menu. He said that'd be fine, but after consulting with the kitchen came back and told me they'd rather serve it as the dish on the menu. I love a great ham, but was pretty disappointed with how Avec killed it. The great ham was served with crisp tart apples, avocado, LOTS of pepper, olive oil, and vinegar. I couldn't taste any of the smoky ham flavor through the curtain of accompaniments. Unfortunate. Avec has a great menu with lots of interesting, original combinations. With such talent and creativity, I'd expect the chefs to highlight great ingredients rather than hide them.For an entree I had the roasted pork shoulder, which took a while but was worth the wait. It was served in an individual cast iron hot out of the oven. The pork was obviously fork-tender, and the sauce and veggies melded together exquisitely.

Well, except for the name, because in reality they are chorizo meatballs wrapped in dates and bacon. When you see an item with that name on a menu for $9, the picture in your head is not what you're going to get. Here I am imagining these little dates with a nibble of chorizo inside... instead, this is main course kind of food. I went so far as to save one last bite so it could be the last thing I ate before leaving. I will remember that dish forever.Luckily for us, Avec offers so much more. And from our tiny sampling of the menu, everything delivers in a surprising way.My girlfriend and I went on a Monday night, just before 6, and our timing couldn't have been better. I had assumed it would be crowded and we'd be sitting at the bar (if at all), but we were promptly seated and began enjoying a couple of beers almost immediately as we looked over the menu.The dishes at Avec are designed and portioned to be shared with others, which was perfect for us because we always wind up splitting entrees. We decided to go \"light,\" which meant we only chose 4 plates and an appetizer of house marinated olives, while skipping dessert.The starter plate of olives and bread was a perfect beginning, with a variety of olives each having a unique flavor (the smallest ones had a chocolaty note, while another kind definitely had a gorgonzola/blue cheese element). Our next plate was the roasted sunchoke crostini. It was so unexpectedly flavorful that it rivals the aforementioned chorizo-stuffed dates for favorite part of the meal. Perhaps it was the truffle vinaigrette that added the perfect amount of saltiness to the fluffy, bitter greens, but whatever it was, this was the moment we really knew we were in for a special meal.Our third dish... did I mention the chorizo-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon? I can't stress enough how amazing this dish was. I told my girlfriend that I wished I lived in Chicago and worked nearby, just so I could make a weekly visit for this dish. The pequillo pepper tomato sauce was really what sent this into the stratosphere, with just enough acidity to tame the sweetness of the dates and the spice of the sausage. Since we were unaware of what we were getting into with the chorizo-stuffed dates, we followed this meatball feast with a second meatball feast -- the turkey and guanciale meatballs with orzo. These were fantastic, but I'm sad to say that I could barely pay attention to them because I was still savoring the previous plate. Still, how can you go wrong with meatballs made from delicate bacon made from the jowls of a pig? The orzo was perfectly cooked as well. If you fear the spice of chorizo, perhaps this would be a good alternate choice?Finally, we capped our meal off with the roasted swordfish. It was delicious (I had never had swordfish). I was especially thrilled at how well the smoked ham hock complimented the fish, and absolutely stunned at the flavors in the braised chana dal. There was this wonderful lemon/citrus flavor that burst out after a few moments, turning the whole concoction into this wonderful mix of tender and crispy, smoky and sweet.Best of all: the price! This is top notch, gourmet dining at a pretty affordable price. Our tab (4 beers and 5 dishes) came to almost $80 before tip, and we could have (maybe should have?) trimmed one dish from our list and still remained absolutely stuffed. Of course, we regret not even glancing at the dessert menu, but one more bite could have ruined us.For those who don't like to rub elbows with others, be forewarned: the seating at Avec can be tight, as everyone basically sits together. This was actually kind of fun for us, because you get to ask people about their food or even give recommendations to a new party seated right next to you. The service is quick and impeccable, and the setting is more of a dinner party atmosphere than I would have expected. Avec was completely without pretense or the snootiness one would expect from a 5 star establishment.

Second off, I heard great things about the food here and it was decently crowded on a Tuesday night. However, after eating here, I just didn't feel like this is somewhere I'd want to come back to.I agree with other reviewers, the hostess is a little snotty. She refused to seat us until our entire party was there, which is fine, but she didn't let us sit at the bar because those are dinner seats too. This place is so small that there is literally no place to wait if your friend is stuck in traffic! You kind of have to huddle by the door which isn't a fun experience. When we finally got seated we were seated at a communal table with two other groups of people who were already eating. Akward. We had to ask one side of the table to stand so that we could get into the MIDDLE of the table. The seats were horribly uncomfortable and I can't even imagine how someone 6 feet can sit here because I was uncomfortable and I am a tiny asian person. The food was good, but I didn't think it was anything special. Some dishes were well priced, others were priced very high for what they were (english pea on bread for $10? really?). Our waitress was okay but I wish she were dressed a little nicer. I mean, isn't this supposed to be a trendy place? And finally, after eating myself until I was stuffed, I felt sick all night. I think this is a sign that the food isn't really that well made. I've eaten at several restaurants before and stuffed myself and felt fine. Not so here.

The salmon was absolutely perfectly cooked and of high quality. \u00a0The pairing with the fingerling potatoes were just OK. \u00a0I thought the sauce was bland and the potatoes were underdone.- Toscano Salumi plate: yummy.Cheese plate: spain - la pata cabra, france - tomme brebis, and portugal - castelinhos: super yummy, very high quality cheese. \u00a0We also ordered the accurtiamets and they paired nicely. \u00a0However, they give you one very small piece of bread for a generous portion of cheese, and I just think it's a poor balance. \u00a0We would have asked for more... but the service.Service 2-3 stars: \u00a0We walked it an 8pm on a Wednesday and they lovely hostess took our name and number and said she would call in 60-90 minutes. \u00a0We were plesently suprised to hear from her an hour later with our table. \u00a0We walked over sat down and our server promptly showed up, which was the peak point of our waiters attention.What went wrong: \u00a0I originally wrote this huge explanation, but in the bottom line is that our server was inattentive, flippant, and borderline rude to us. But the highlight is that \u00a0we are noshing on the yummy dates and my friend who ordered a French 75 has this really funky glass that is like a cocktail glass but they make a thin 1/2 inch stem and no bottom to balance it. \u00a0So, my friend knocks it over when we are trying to make room on our table, and the waiter who is about 3 people away looks over and lets out a VERBAL scoff at us and literally runs away. \u00a0The very helpful runner who is right there apoligizes for the clutter of glasses and gets napkins and helps us. \u00a0I realize it isn't the most gracious move to knock over a glass in a trendy restaurant, but seriously when you service glasses with a thin stem and no bottom, you shouldn't get that upset. \u00a0Oh and our waiter also brought out 6 wine glasses when we told you only 2 people were drinking it. \u00a0Which, if you have been here you know how overly crowded and limiting that makes the table.This was the whole attitude toward us the whole night. \u00a0And we were pulling teeth to get a second round of drinksBottom line: I'll be back BUT I would be disinclined to bring someone from out of town, like we did, knowing the service.", "Date": "2012-09-20", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Chris D.", "ReviewID": "SIQn24Sgg2Yf_KSZpKlOvg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say about avec that hasn't already been said?

I thought it would make a better small plate and found it almost overwhelming but at the same time boring to eat such a large (half) portion.

What we got was an insanely bright and overlit restaurant with a really long wait, average food, bad service and a cold, communal table seat right by the rainy open doors. Bleh.

Avec doesn't take reservations but we were seated quite quickly in one of the few open spots left (in-between two parties, sharing the same table). They don't take reservations and it's clear why- they don't need to (the small, yet efficiently run restaurant was packed) and they simply can't afford to let space go to waste waiting on a reservation to show. They use every inch of space in that place and I mean inch. If you are someone who requires a certain amount of personal space, you will not enjoy your time at Avec. So the food- a lean selection of small and large plates, all expertly prepared and intended to share. My companion insisted we have the shaved Brussels sprouts salad (I hate, hate, hate Brussels sprouts but agreed to try it) and it was my favorite dish of the night. A very complex dish- lemon, mint, dill, and other flavors working together for a unique taste: crisp and zesty. Perfect for a summer evening. We followed that with the bacon-wrapped-chorizo-filled dates. They were very large due to the stuffing. I have a long standing love affair with bacon-wrapped dates so this dish was not to be missed. I do admit I was a bit disappointed that the chorizo became the main flavor here, but they were delicious none the less and filling. We finished our meal with the deluxe focaccia with truffle oil. It was simply decedent deliciousness. I will say that living a 95% veggie lifestyle most of the time made it a bit tough for me to stomach these rich, not-quite-as-healthy foods but it was a much enjoyed treat. We shared a bottle of wonderfully crisp white wine from their wine list. A wine enthusiast friend of mine warns to never spend over $25 for a bottle, but there were not too many options on Avec's list to meet that price, so expect to spend but also enjoy. \u00a0And that's what we did.Service was fast and friendly.

When comparing our findings, the one common recommendation across all three was Avec.As we approached Avec, it felt like a cold, contemporary, urban hot spot that thinks it's better than you with it's minimalist wood planked walls and ceilings, back-lit feature wall made up of empty red and white wine bottles and architecturally-restrained communal tables and low-backed seats. However, once you're plopped amongst strangers who have to get up to provide you access to your seat in the middle of said communal table, you begin to realize that you're in for an intimate, chummy one-of-a-kind dining experience.Up until last Wednesday, I thought I knew what \"communal dining\" was - boy, did I need to be learned!! Initially, I was disoriented about how close we were to unfamiliar diners on all four sides! After settling into the menu and a nice bottle of wine (a Periquita - which I remember to be a smooth, tasty Spanish red), which our waitress cheerily and adeptly recommended, I acclimated to the idea of eating out of a complete stranger's lap!We were advised to order either two small plates or one large plate per person - we picked two and two (which was just right):+ Gnocchi with ramp-arugula pesto + confit shrimp - W! O! W! This ranks as one of the Top Five Dishes I've ever had in my life! This made me forget about being cramped and annoyed I could barely hear my companions. For 10 minutes, it was ALL about my tongue making love to this gnocchi. (I know: EHWWWWWW!)+ Chorizo-stuffed dates wrapped in smoked bacon - This was identified as one of Avec's \"signature\" items and it certainly earns the props! The chorizo-date was tender like a meatball, trying to be held together by bacon all coated in a tomato sauce with a bit of a kick.+ \"Deluxe\" focaccia with tageggio cheese + truffle oil - Another winner! Maybe a bit too big for three, but we certainly weren't complaining. Anything that's baked and drizzled with truffle oil is A-OK in my book. The focaccia is sliced thin, crispy and almost sandwich-like (with the gooey goodness in the middle).+ Marinated hangar steak with asparagus - My least fave of the four dinner plates. This dish certainly didn't suck, but when compared to ungodly greatness, something was bound to fall a bit short.Despite the crowd, I think this is a great place for a date night and special occasions.

I just cannot believe this place has such a hype built up here. Lets review and be objective, and see if we can stop this new trend of 'let me charge you a huge price for seating uncomfortably and eating mediocre food in small quantities' that Chicago seems to like so much in the restaurant scene. I work hard for my money, therefore I take it personally when I feel like I threw it away. \u00a0The first problem arrived when I saw the tables, communal tables? yeah, but in the sense that you literally are seated at a table full of strangers talking right next to your ear. Still, I wouldn't mind it if the food was worthy. But the worst part is thinking about all the money these people make, seriously they cannot afford to expand the place a little and put some decent tables for their costumers. But why would they? if we keep giving them thumbs up for overcharging us for tiny plates of overrated, boring food, and overcrowding us like farm chickens. The second problem, the dishes. \u00a0Yeah the dates are good, but not 'communal tables' good, they are ok (apparently a decent appetizer is all you need to built a reputation) We tried the hanger steak, the pork shoulder and .... meh. But the focaccia bread was what really angered me, I just cannot understand how people can be ok with being charged $15 for a piece of oily bread with cheese. It didn't had any flavor whatsoever, the only thing you could taste was oil, and yes is ''truffle oil\", but it is still oil; a condiment, not an end in itself and for sure not something you can just throw on a piece of bread and call it a night like they do here. We waited over 20 min for the pork shoulder, after we had finished off all of our plates. When it finally came we were ready to leave, tired and annoyed at the fact that we couldn't talk, over the voices of the bratty girls next to us, \u00a0who apparently wanted the whole restaurant to hear their conversation (I know all the details on the cost of the wedding of one of them etc) not my idea of a pleasant night out. When we tried the pork shoulder the flavor was just not good. The meat \u00a0was tender and juicy, however it didn't taste good period. Well, I know it is a long rant, but I needed to vent after I spent my hard earned money in this joke.

Purposely went early on a weekday to beat any rush - for whatever reason waiting in lines has become particularly annoying for me recently.Had the dates, of course, and they were indeed quite good. The spice and meatiness of the chorizo and the sweetness of the dates provided a nice balance to one another, and a plain tomato sauce was perfect for cutting the richness of the dish just a tiny bit. Not sure the bacon added much to the environment, and perhaps the dates overpowered the chorizo a bit, but those are minor quibbles. Overall, really enjoyed the pairing of these disparate ingredients to create a flavor that was new and exciting, but satisfying in the most familiar way. We also had an apple, honeycomb and prosciutto salad which was perfect for a surprisingly warm Chicago spring evening. Refreshing and rich in one bite.Unfortunately, the rest of the offerings disappointed. The pork shoulder was fall off the bone tender, yes, but I felt that it didn't offer much in the way of flavor. After hearing about its glories, I was left feeling let down - and it isn't as if braising a pork shoulder requires any particular acumen. I've certainly had much better from supposedly 'lesser' restaurants. Same for the fried smelt - good, but for the price certainly not good value. Especially considering I could swing down to Chinatown and have a superior fried smelt, dressed with salt, pepper and jalapeno, for a fraction of the price.

The chorizo stuff bacon wrapped dates blew my mind. Such an incredible and interesting mix of flavors. The cheese plate was also really good. Had the bratwurst which was nice and the beans and sauce with it were amazing. The flatbread...holy cow. Such a simple concept that was absolutely insane...one of the best things I've had in a long time. Then we got the foie gras which was really good, only thing that would have improved it would have been some better bread for it, more crusty style to spread it on, but overall delicious. Then desserts...the homemade crepes were awesome and the affogato was nice as well, the biscotti's being the best part of it. I think this meal rates as #1 in chicago thus far for me!

The staff was friendly, but definitely did not provide the attention to detail we expected. The food wasn't bad, but we have had better on many occasions. Overall we won't be returning. Here is a list of specific complaints:- Although we were seated immediately, it was over 10 minutes before a server appeared. Apparently there was a problem with the computer, so we had multiple people serving us, yet no one took the time to go over the menu or available specials.- Wine recommendation was quite good, but felt rushed and rather than waiting for me to try a small portion of the wine the server delivered a full carafe and said \"just yell at me if you don't like it.\" - Beer selection was small, but decent. Unfortunately the beer was served much too cold (coor's light blue mountain kind of cold), and didn't get to the proper temperature until desert.- My husband had just decanted the last of the beer into his glass, leaving the yeast-sludge in the bottle (it was a bottle-fermented Belgian ale) when a busser abruptly reached over and dumped the dead yeast into his glass and whisked away the now empty bottle. We don't expect everyone to know that part of the reason you serve a bottle fermented beer with a glass is to avoid drinking 2 ounces of dead yeast cells... but we do expect the staff at Avec to know that.- We had a somewhat spicy, saucy small plate (the chorizo stuffed dates) followed by a very subtle larger plate. After finishing the dates our plates and cutlery were covered in spicy red oil, and when the quail arrived we sat there politely waiting for the plates and cutlery to be replaced. The quail was nearly cold when we realized no clean dishes were coming and our attempt to get anyone's attention was futile. We resorted to wiping the plates and cutlery with a napkin, because otherwise the quail was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of chorizo. - Maybe it was the spicy chorizo, but the quail was just bland. We aren't the sort of American diners who demand all French food be bathed in sauce. There was plenty of sauce. The sauce just didn't *go* anywhere.- The cutlery was inappropriate for the dishes. The dates were huge and required being halved or (for a lady) quartered, however we had only dull butter-knives. I had to literally saw through each piece. Because neither the plates nor cutlery were replaced when the quail came out, we were again using bulky, dull knives to get through the delicate birds. A sharp, pointed knife would have been the appropriate choice for each, and we know they exist because that's what we were given with our kale--which did not require cutting!- The kale came with a bread that would have been good but for it's salt crust. One bite and our tongues were numb from the salt. Palate fatigue much?- We were never asked if we were done with anything. We were still enjoying the sauce from our dates with a nearly full chunk of bread when a busser suddenly grabbed the bread with his hands and removed the plate of sauce. I literally had a piece of the bread in my hands. This is the same busser who failed to remove the sauce-covered plates and cutlery.- The restaurant was so loud that casual conversation was impossible. It wasn't until the drive home that we realized we hadn't actually heard each others voice for over an hour.", "Date": "2011-09-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jon C.", "ReviewID": "e8XF3dtk4SEjY7G8zGThQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "3rd time here is past year.

Pickled vegetables formed a sour counterpoint to the burrata. Good dish.from wikipedia: Burrata is a fresh Italian cheese, made from mozzarella and cream. The outer shell is solid mozzarella while the inside contains both mozzarella and cream, giving it an unusual, soft texture. It is also defined by some sources as an outer shell of mozzarella filled with butter or a mixture of butter and sugar. It is usually served fresh, at room temperature.

I followed up my Full House flashback with the braised pork which was equally fantastic. The portions were decently sized as opposed to Blackbird, Avec's sister restaurant and I left reasonably full for someone of my eating capacity.

The 'sommelier' recommended a wine that for $50 all three of us agreed was frankly ordinary. The food at avec is an unexciting, pretentious attempt at modern American cuisine afflicted with the trendy affectation toward 'small and large plates' designed for oh-so-cool sharing. Said menu contains such culinary masterpieces as cheese foccacia, a bowl of olives, a third of a tasteless sausage in a bitter broth, a flavourless salad, a chicken thigh, a brandade and a pizza. Attempts at further trendiness include the existence of a ham slicing machine on the bar (?!) and the pulsating sound system of an Abercrombie and Fitch.

The food is inspired by traditional Mediterranean cuisine but departs to uniquely modern taste combinations. Dishes are usually served in the cookware they were cooked in, from a cast-iron pot of pasta to a wood-fired pizza served on its wooden slab. The menu is divided into large dishes and small dishes--prime dining for a group of friends, or else a good way to make friends with the people around you. One large plate generally serves one person and two or three small plates make for one serving, although all dishes seem destined to be shared. The design of the restaurant itself forces such communalism, with minimalist tables and chairs crammed together side-by-side in the already cramped dining room. Even the diner's relationship to the cooking staff is communal, as the ranges and wood-fire ovens stand open in the corner of the room. I'm usually averse to claustrophobic spaces but something about Avec makes it feel like a room full of friends, loud and close. The outstanding food certainly doesn't hurt in easing me into such amiability.

Hands down. \u00a0I kid you not. \u00a0It's one of the few places of its league that I want to go back to consistently. \u00a0I know Chicago has a ton of great restaurants and going to the same place all the time may seem almost a waste of time, but Avec is the exception. \u00a0Yes, it is THAT great.I am picky. \u00a0And not just about food. \u00a0I am high maintenance about the service and atmosphere that my food is served in. \u00a0I don't eat just to get full - I eat for the food. \u00a0I would rather starve than eat bad food. \u00a0My boyfriend can verify all of that in a heartbeat. \u00a0Anyway. \u00a0Back to Avec. \u00a0Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) on Avec's menu is consistently delicious in a very down-to-earth kind of way; the inviting, warm, casual-yet-chic atmosphere as well as the spunky, personable servers only enhance the entire experience. \u00a0I am usually not a fan of communal-style seating in a restaurant but Avec somehow does it right - it is cozy and intimate and the crowd there is always friendly so it works perfectly with the whole ambiance. \u00a0I will not sit here and recommend specific dishes that you need to try because I am certain that no matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. \u00a0The food comes in small portions (which I absolutely LOVE) so you can get a fair sample of a good portion of the menu. \u00a0One thing that I will say is definitely try the wines - it comes in smaller portions so you can have more variety. \u00a0They have a wonderful collection of wines and the servers make great recommendations. \u00a0It is an open kitchen, where you can see the chefs preparing your food at no matter where you're sitting in the restaurant. \u00a0It is the second best open kitchen besides Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas (but that is another story for another day). \u00a0There is something awfully comforting about knowing how your food is being prepared. \u00a0That is minor though - just an added bonus.The one thing and the only thing that should ever hold you back from going to Avec is the wait. \u00a0As you already know by now, they do not take reservations and chances are you will have to wait, and waiting sucks because you're 50% starving and 50% pissed off and all you do is stand there and watch other people devour the food you came to eat. \u00a0Well at Avec, the wait can be part of the experience. \u00a0Get drinks while you wait. \u00a0And when it's not freezing outside, they set up wine barrels as tables and umbrellas so you can enjoy your drinks outside. \u00a0AND, you'll probably be sipping on an empty stomach so chances are, you will get at least somewhat tipsy, which will make the wait go a hell of a lot faster. \u00a0Don't get me wrong - I am NOT a patient person and I do NOT like wait for a meal - it's different at Avec though - just trust me. \u00a0Don't let the wait hold you back. Basically, if you live in Chicago (or anywhere close) and you haven't gone to Avec yet, you are missing out on life. \u00a0Sure, the food isn't cheap and definitely not diet-friendly, but let me tell you what you need to do: starve yourself for a day or two so you're saving not only the money but also the calories and haul your ass to Avec. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and JUST GO.", "Date": "2009-02-24", "Author_Location": "Evanston, IL"}, {"Author": "Made N.", "ReviewID": "h4_u6BgAsdoGVjhno0KHvQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I know, I know, everyone loves this place. \u00a0I am definitely NOT a foodie, so maybe that's the problem and I also don't eat things which at one point had faces or things which came from things with faces (i.e. I'm a vegan). \u00a0Turns out this poses a eating-challenge here. \u00a0Our wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday night (about 1/2 hour); we passed it sipping a good wine outside by the warming \"posts\" which were appreciated (although chairs might have been nice too), but inside - aye-yay-yay. \u00a0The long string of tables runs all along the one wall (with the other wall being a bar/kitchen), so you're essentially sitting RIGHT next to the guy next to you, whether you came with him or not. \u00a0I had to get out every time the two next to me wanted to use the washroom or whatever because they were literally trapped in.

So with this fantastic seating opportunity, my sister and I did not shy away from finding out every detail of ingredients being used, recommendations for the evening, and other random questions we were dying to know about every dish that came out. He was a good sport in keeping his focus on the food while still having a moment or two to chat.We started with the chorizo stuffed dates which not to be redundant to the many other reviewers, were satiating. The spice in the chorizo complimented the sweetness of the date and the red pepper sauce they were cooked in added an even more dynamic layer of flavor. We were doubly surprised by the taste and the enormous portion size for the dates - very filling. Next came the hanger steak salad with fresh strawberries - unique combination of flavors and refreshingly light to follow the richness of the dates. Our main dish was the braised pork shoulder served in a broth with garlic sausage, tomatoes, pesto, and a pasta. Again the meat was unbelievably tender.

Street Parking was easy to find, though Sunday afternoon also helped. Since it was early, we were seated right away. I liked the concept of No Reservations, this allowed fair game for all to grab a seat, also this created a flexibility that allows for casual dining. Price is in the mid range and the food was the same. My wife and I had gone to Longman and Eagle two nights before and Avec just didn't quite lived up to the hyped of other yelp reviews. We ordered the Hanger Steak, Cheese Platter (La Peral was the highlight), the Red Fish, the Medjool Dates, and the Wood - Fired Squid. All our dishes were good, but they were not great and left both of us wondering what the hype was about. I just expected to more and was just left wanting. Perhaps the expectation was too great and quality just can't be maintained. I think after the media publicity on No Reservations, the hype got even bigger. I compared Avec to Longman because of their price range, ambiance, and type of food. Longman definitely beat Avec by a long shot. Avec didn't give us any reason to come back, where as Longman's drinks invited us in and the food made us wanting to come back.", "Date": "2012-09-03", "Author_Location": "Louisville, KY"}, {"Author": "alexander s.", "ReviewID": "KOq_QDhlhvo492fNgm1RRg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "holy cow. the chorizo stuffed dates? amazing!", "Date": "2009-09-12", "Author_Location": "Riverside, CA"}, {"Author": "Margaret C.", "ReviewID": "UNeZzm6X-nZWWQmVqm3ZZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this place is awesome. if you haven't been, drop what you're doing and go immediately. unless you can't stand close quarters, in which case, you're out of luck.", "Date": "2008-09-01", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Ally N.", "ReviewID": "I4ER3AXE0BSvKMXA2DNn0g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i went here with a friend recently for the first time. \u00a0the atmosphere is very fun (and loud), and the communal tables are a great idea -- but given the noise level, we sat at the bar so we could hear each other w/o yelling. \u00a0the service was decent and the food was pretty good, but i would advise going there with at least a party of three or four because the portions are too big for two people to try more than 3 or 4 plates. \u00a0the chorizo-stuffed, bacon wrapped dates were great, but the generous portions of chorizo stuffing overwhelmed the dish and made me too full too fast. \u00a0i LOVED the batter and fried cauliflower -- it was the most delicious cauliflower i've ever had! \u00a0and the cheese platter was pretty good (depends on which cheeses you choose though). \u00a0all-in-all, the food is great, and the atmosphere is appropriate for a fun place to go with some girlfriends, but definitely too bright and loud for a romantic date.", "Date": "2009-02-12", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Wangston P.", "ReviewID": "BcM3tzRDbwNJ2gOHiizRCA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "we had a great dinner here. good service if a little serious. some of the dishes (chorizo stuffed dates!) are fantastic. some of the dishes (octopus salad - super sour dressing with oddly bland octopus) were just okay, and i'm not sure i have a sense of how to order next time i come to avoid the bad choices which is unusual! it seems like they are trying to get intense flavors into every dish, which is exciting but difficult to pull of consistently.", "Date": "2011-07-07", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Rich S.", "ReviewID": "6oHqiDka_Mh9IsLZuE9i1g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Six of us arrived around 11:15 PM Saturday night.

The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because the busboys are too exuberant, taking away our \u00a0wine glasses while we still had wine in the bottle and constantly trying to remove dishes with food still on them. Not that big a deal but we had an episode when one lady in our party poured the remaining wine in her empty water glass and then the busboy started to pour water in that glass.

I read the yelp profile of almost every restaurant I go to before I go, but normally I just never find the desire to go back and write a review about a restaurant. Let me tell you though, I feel I would be doing a disservice to the world not spreading the word about Avec. It really can be summed up as a food lover's perfect dining experience. I went with my mom on our last night in Chicago. We were seated in the middle of one of their communal tables. Immediately the groups on either side introduced themselves. The group to our left turned out to all be waiters at another famous Chicago restaurant, The Girl and the Goat, and the group to our right was a group of food-loving professors. Both sides offered us tastes of their food, recommendations of their favorite dishes, and even the remainder of their bottle of wine. We spent the rest of the evening enjoying one of the tastiest and most reasonably priced meals I had ever had. The snail pappardelle was the best pasta I have ever eaten, and the fontina flat bread was simply divine.
