This restaurant is amazing the staff, their service and the food and drinks they serve are top notch! After 6 days in New Orleans this was hands down my favorite place we ate in. We went back because it was so wonderful. The staff.... A friendly group that truly show southern hospitality. On our first visit we sat at the bar where our bartender Brandi, made some fabulous cocktails and even gave us tea to go since it was so hot and she knew we had walked. \u00a0The oyster snickers Jamaal and Derick were so fun to visit with the told us places to go get their favorite po' boys. The found us huge delicious plump oysters while shucking and getting us laughing. What a wonderful experience.Now for the food.....OH MY GOSH, absolutely fabulous. We wanted to lick our plates. I will start with one of my friends dish, it was a simple ham eggs and grits plate. My friend said she didn't like grits but Jamaal said she would like these, he was right she loved the creamy grits and the eggs were cooked to perfection. Another friend had the eggs in a jar, grits with a poached egg and shrimp wonderful presentation and even better flavors deep in the mason jar. My other friend had their matzo ball soup (best we have ever had even in a Jewish Deli) and the frogs legs, crispy and delicious. Even our picky eating friend loved the frog legs. Now for my dish..... I am still dreaming of those flavors. I had the shrimp and grits. Roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits topped with andouille sausage grave packed with sausage then topped with jumbo shrimp. I wanted to lick the plate clean it was the most wonderful dish eaten in New Orleans.We wen back again for happy hour, don't miss it! The oysters were amazing we had them raw and fried. Again the cocktails were wonderful, best mint julep in New Orleans. I felt like I was sitting on the porch of TaraIf you are in New Orleans do not miss the opportunity to try this amazing place!

I have to remind myself to avoid molluscs in New Orleans, they really do not agree with me.For mains, I had the shrimp and grits and discovered that I love grits! Although the size was on the smaller size for the American and NOLA palette, it was perfect for me. From what I heard, the chicken and duck confit were wonderful as well, but the fish entree and the fries with the mussels were salty.Overall, the meal was a little pricey for the ambience and serving size.

Really. Come during that time frame. I don't care if it's too late for lunch and too early for dinner. Just come!!!!It's happy hour time everyday during those time. Ever..y..dayyyyyy!!! And what you get for messing up your internal clock for eating? 50 cents oysters. \u00a0I had $1 oyster happy hours before but never 50 cents. And not just some cheap oysters, but NOLA's famous crazy meaty P&J oysters. Look at my photo of it. Just look. I have never seen one meatier than these at this size. If you like thinner style oysters, these might not be for you.And if you want it cooked instead of raw, they have the same thing for $6 for half a dozen fried ones. \u00a0I didn't have any of those because I ordered 2 dozen raw oysters for just myself. As an afterthought, I should have ordered less raw just to at least try out the fried but I liked the raw one too much.Oh yea. They also have half priced drinks during happy hours too but why would you care about that right?Of course I couldn't just live on raw oysters alone so I started with a small cup of gumbo and because so many mentioned it, I fought internally between their famous burger and what some said was the best Shrimp and Grits around the area. The Shrimp and Grits won out just because it was more of a local food where a burger, no matter how good, is everywhere.I would pass on the gumbo. 3 stars. Good but there are better around the French Quarters.The Shrimp and Grits was amazing. The Shrimp was tender. The grits was buttery smooth. There is a nice slightly charred cheesy shell on top of the sauce which I didn't get at the other place. I would say this is my second favorite Shrimp and Grits so far. Just be aware this one is with a slight french twist as per the kind of higher end restaurant that it was so it's less traditional but not far off. 4.5 starsThe staff was amazingly attentive and friendly. The atmosphere as mentioned was slightly higher end but not to the point of feeling snobby.

The flamenkuche was delicious, the abundance of caramelized onions made this thin-crusted tart have plenty of body, and the frogs' legs, despite being fried, were light and airy, with a nice acidic compliment from the sauces on the plate.Overall the food was amazing, we were so glad we came here. The atmosphere is cute, with \u00a0very classic decor. It is next to/shares bathrooms with the Hilton Hotel's lobby, but it doesn't feel like a hotel restaurant and it is extremely clean.

I wouldn't say the shrimp was JUMBO like the description says it is, but they were medium large. There could be a little bit more shrimp and andouille, but it's a fancy place I guess. My side order of the salad Luke was also delicious. The beets were sweet and just crisp enough. I wouldn't mind ordering a full size for my meal next time.

We were quickly seated and our server came to us about 5 mins later. He gave us the menu and went over the specials for the day. Everything seem good, but once our order came out we never saw him again. He didn't come out to fill our glasses or check on us instead he was waiting on other tables. We finished our meal and had to wave him down several times for the check. Well guess what? Almost 30 mins later he never came back with the check so we had to ask someone else for it. Sorry for the rant about the service, but it wasn't something I expected from a John Besh establishment. About the food. This was our second John Besh restaurant on this trip and I've to say I wasn't overly impressed with either.

Even when I lived here, the Besh restaurants topped my restaurant charts. With my girlfriend visiting the Big Easy for the first time, having never tasted gumbo or had crawfish, L\u00fcke was the choice. We sat down to a table in the front half of the restaurant (the back was closed for the night), but our hostess offered to let us see a view of the kitchen before we sat down. Through gigantic panes of glass, you can see the kitchen army set about their mission. One day it would be lovely to sit in the back and watch them as we eat. As we sat down, I mentioned to our waitress, Shawn, that we were celebrating a special occasion. \u00a0What happened next, I am still unclear. She was motioned away by her manager, Jeff, and the rest became a meal for the ages.She returned with two complimentary glasses of champagne, which they refilled for the rest of the night. We decided that we'd sample both a cup of the bisque and gumbo. For me, the gumbo is exactly what a seafood gumbo should be, a dark not burnt roux, large gulf oysters and shrimp, spicy deja but ready for a dash of tobasco if that's your preference. The crawfish bisque was creamy without being overpowering. It is rich and fragrant, with the final touch being a stuffed crab head sitting right in the middle of the bowl. Shawn returned soon with fried frog legs on the house. I've been having frog legs in many different forms since I was a youngster, but these tempura fried legs were deboned, making them easily cuttable with a fork, with a contrast in sauces with a lemon aioli on top and a green chimichurri on the bottom. Perfectly cooked.With all the rich food, we decided to split the down home delicacy shrimp and grits, and these were the perfect example. Dark roux, grits and perfectly cooked shrimp prawns. They even split ours into separate cast iron skillets. Lastly, they delivered us the only thing we could possibly have eaten- a light and fluffy play on a strawyberry shortcake using strawberries, whipped cream, and the lightest cookies I've ever eaten complete with a birthday candle. The strawberries and cream and \u00a0cookies almost melted in your mouth as you put them to your lips. Perfect compliment to our bubbly.We were in awe of the magic of the evening, the warmth of the people- specifically, Vusi the backwaiter, Shawn, our entertaining and funny server, and Jeff, the manager who stopped by to make sure we enjoyed everything. I couldn't have been more proud of Louisiana showing my girlfriend true southern hospitality. All in all, the evening could be summed up in one little exchange as they poured us another glass of champagne:Her: What is happening here?

We visit New Orleans once a year for the past several years and just added this to our must visit list for when we are in town (along with Willie Mae, Mothers and Cafe du Monde, and Big Fisherman). We came here for a second dinner (around 9:45 PM so no wait) during one of our food conquests. The 5 of us ordered family style so we can try a little bit of everything. Our orders were delish, good quality and good taste. Everything on the dish made sense and the flavors complimented each other (not like this other place we went to during our food conquest).Terrine Of Slow Cooked Foie Gras - Frois gras patte. I've had some in the past that didn't fare so well. Not the same as frois gras saut\u00e9ed, but done well. I'd order this again. Crawfish Bisque - Utter creamy goodness for crawfish lovers. You really taste the crawfish. Salad Luke- Liked the salad. Get a lil of everything on one fork and it's a nice fresh bite. Creamy, sweet and sour. One negative, it was too overdressed. Maybe because it was late, the kitchen person had a heavy hand. Would still get again and ask for less dressing. Entrec\u00f4te Grill\u00e9e Et Frites- Rib eye steak with fancy butter done right. All 5 of us hands down LOVED this dish. Fresh gulf fish of the day was sheepshead fish battered. - At the end of the trip we didn't want anymore fried food, but this dish was okay. It was gone by the end of the evening even though we were full. Poulet Grand-m\u00e8re - Normally I do not like chicken. It's usually white meat and dry. However, this is a half chicken (bones and all) and makes it to my top chicken meals. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and went so well with Allen Benton's bacon and the mixed veggies. One small downside is the mash was on the salty side, but we'd order this again. Another 5/5 at the table.Brendan's Bread Pudding- The only other place I've had this better was at a top US steakhouse. Very good. Steamed Chocolate - Gone in 1 minute. Bourbon Vanilla Bean Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Also good. All in all, 5 out of 5 of us liked Lukes.

It's a popular and highly regarded restaurant in downtown New Orleans. Because of this, it is pertinent to have reservations and of course arrive in a timely manner. For all the hype, it's very unfortunate that my experiences at Luke have been less than stellar.It's been a while, but my first visit to Luke was during dinner hours. Our service was on par but the food was not. To start, we ordered Boudin Balls. I adore boudin - but NOT from Luke. Something simple and delicious was hard and tasteless. For entrees, my friend and I ordered the same dish: the Poulet Grand-mere. Neither of us were impressed. In the end we spent the rest of dinner staring \u00a0down our other friend who had ordered the giant Luke Burger.Most recently, I was herded to Luke for Brunch before venturing out to the French Quarter Festival. When we were finally seated after our reservation time, regardless of the many other open tables, we were seated at a table just a few feet from the front door and host stand. Although we made the best of it, it is very easy to be distracted by the masses coming in and huffing as they are turned away due to no reservations. Our server did not help to make our experience any better. Although very nice and knowledgeable of the menu, he was obviously distracted, inattentive (would disappear for 20-30 minute intervals) and mixed up/forgot various orders from beginning to end. After starting off with a few adult bevs (one forgotten and not to be seen for 30 minutes when we were finally able to flag our server down) and placing our orders we had plenty of time to chat and enjoy each others company. This was great except over an hour later we had no drinks left, did not have our orders nor had we seen our server. Something was up and we knew it!And right we were. They began bringing our food out in waves... except mine. My breakfast sandwich had supposedly been given away to another table. Starving, thirsty and about to go all primal \u00a0on the poor guy, he had enough sense to reel me in (just slightly) with \"I'll be taking care of your brunch this afternoon\". But you know what the real saving grace was? He brought me another adult bev to enjoy during my wait. The extra step to go above and beyond in attempt to make it up to me. My boiling attitude was quickly turned to a slight simmer. And when my food was brought out within 10 minutes after everyone else, I was relieved.We could only assume that these blunders were due to the madness of FQF. It's still hard for me to swallow though since their tables are rationed out by reservation times and the place had empty tables throughout our time there (almost 2.5 hours!!!!!!).Food/Drink:+Champagne au peche: a mix of champagne and peach puree, this is a rather refreshing and enjoyable drink. However it is also very small for $9.75/ea!+Sausage, Egg & Cheese biscuit: HUGE and DELICIOUS! I had to take one sausage patty off and eat a few pieces of scrambled egg to make this monstrosity more manageable. Definitely something I'd order again, if I ever return.+home fries: a rather small side item for $5, but so good. Not fries but large chunks of oily potatoes with sauteed onions and bits of meat (not mentioned on the menu but a nice surprise for this carnivore)Pro Tip: If you stay in the Hilton next door, you're able to order room service from Luke!", "Date": "2014-04-17", "Author_Location": "New Orleans, LA"}, {"Author": "David C.", "ReviewID": "EpUfmgIX_sQWpAm8KTzV6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How has anyone not given this place 5 stars.

It didn't matter though, they managed to fit us in with no wait. The first time we came for a late brunch. Two of my friends got the Luke burger and I split the local crab omelette with a friend.

So when the waitress mentioned that eggs in a jar were one of their most popular options, i believed her (I saw three of them come out while we were deciding what to get). Look, I understand it's one of the more important things on the menu, but if someone in your party gets this, and it's not you, you're going to be jealous. You are. So just order it.

How irresponsible of me, in New Orleans, on a bachelor party, to drink that much the night before. I say this not to sound cool because I party (still, I mean, guilty), but because my meal at L\u00fcke (don't forget the umlaut!) was a truly amazing breakfast and I'd like to attribute that to the restaurant and not my then-state of malnutrition and dehydration.Now, when you first see the menu, it's a bit overwhelming (again, let's assume this is not a side effect of drinking), and maybe even a bit expensive. But rest assured, it is money well spent - you will certainly taste the high-quality products they put in their dishes here.I went with the seemingly straight-forward Southern Breakfast, soon realizing it was more of a Choose Your Own Adventure-type deal once the waiter started rattling off a series of this-or-that questions to me. Ultimately, I went with two (organic) sunny side-up eggs, some dude named Allan Benton's bacon (apparently, he's a big deal in the bacon world), a biscuit, and hash browns. That last item I honestly didn't see listed anywhere, not even as a side, but if I were you, I'd inquire about 'em, because they were the absolute highlight of my meal. The real surprise was that these taters came tossed with big chunks of super savory, tremendously tasty, thick-cut bacon. Of course, this kind of negated my Allan Benton's bacon pick. Therefore, fair warning, if you get the hash browns, choose the Chisesi ham (yes, L\u00fcke likes to name-drop) or cane syrup sausage, if you want to try a different meat. Otherwise, hey, double bacon. Which is never a bad thing.Either seeing how banged up our group of bros was on a Saturday morning and just figuring we were on a bachelor party weekend (correct, as we later confirmed with them), or L\u00fcke has the most generous staff in New Orleans (could honestly be both of these things), we were brought over two bottles of champagne on the house to help us celebrate. We certainly weren't ordering extravagantly enough to deserve them, nor did our bodies particularly need 'em (please, we still drank up), but man, was that just a super nice gesture, much appreciated.I will say though* that the strange layout of the restaurant was something I just couldn't get over during my meal. Typically I can ignore these things, especially when a meal is this good. But anyway, we were led to L\u00fcke's back half, which was weirdly across a hotel hallway. It had the kitchen on display in what looked like a glass interrogation booth. And it also lacked the high ceilings and open feel of the front of the house, which came off as stately and very gastropub-y. This back room didn't come off as much of anything, and honestly just seemed like an afterthought, a place to put more patrons.Still, strange second rooms won't deter me from making a repeat visit next time I'm in town. I'll just ask to be sat in the front half. And for more hash browns with bacon, please. And maybe some Aleve.

It's always sweltering hot in New Orleans. Wherever you go, you sweat. Every part of your body is moist - and not in the \"I just ate a deliciously moist cupcake\" kind of way. You're walking all over town. You're hungry, but you're not thinking about food. You're thinking about cooling off. You could go to the casino, or perhaps stop into a hotel lobby for a quick respite from the heat and humidity. But if you really want to cool off - if you really want to turn your body's moistness into a chilly frost and bring your temperature down to almost absolute zero - stop into L\u00fcke.L\u00fcke restaurant is, without a doubt, the coldest restaurant on Earth, and perhaps beyond. If you sit directly beneath the cooling vent like my wife and I did - both times we visited, no less - you could probably die. \u00a0Or, if you're like me, you'll absolutely love it. I'm a polar bear and find myself in my natural habitat when I am here. Thank you, thank you, John Besh. Thank you, L\u00fcke. Thank you for being a freezing cold oasis in an otherwise deathly urban desert.Now onto the food...As I mentioned before, my wife and I came here twice. That is, two times, during a 4-day vacation. In a place like New Orleans where there is SO MUCH good food everywhere you look, it is almost sacrilege to eat in the same place twice in one trip. (Good thing it was so hot out.)The first time we came in for breakfast, and it was awesome. I had the classic southern staple: a fried chicken biscuit with a spicy mayhaw glaze. I have no idea what the hell mayhaw is, but it was so yummy and decadent, I felt like I needed to be spanked afterward. My wife had the egg white frittata, complete with burrata cheese and Covey Rise vegetables. (Whatever that means.) For a healthy dish, it looked absolutely delicious. She loved it. Of course, breakfast in New Orleans would not be complete without the obligatory basket of powdered beignets. \u00a0You can get them with chocolate dipping sauce or a fresh berry jam. We opted for the blueberry jam. Absolutely amazing. L\u00fcke also makes a mean Bloody Mary - almost a little too mean for my taste. It's not that I mind the spiciness. \u00a0In fact, I love that. But the L\u00fcke Bloody Mary is just so crimson red and flavorfully intense, with an eerie viscosity that reminds me a little too much of actual blood. Still, try one. Just one gave me a buzz that lasted all morning long.The second time we came for brunch. No chicken biscuit on this menu, but lots of other options. I was so hungover during this meal that as I am drafting this review on a plane with no Internet, I can't even remember off the top of my head what the hell me or my wife ordered, but I do remember it being really good. (For more on my hangover, see my review for the Clover Caf\u00e9.)UPDATE: Having cheated and looked back at the menu, I can now recall our bizarre order: the heirloom tomato salad, Mimi's buttermilk pancakes with the honey-pecan butter, and an order of the house fries. We just shared it all, and no evidence remained once we were done. Yeah, everything is that good.All in all I would give L\u00fcke a solid 4.5 stars. But since Yelp doesn't allow half-star ratings, I'm more than happy to give L\u00fcke a 5. \u00a0Service was very friendly both times, though they do get busy and it may be a little difficult to get your check. But at least they don't try to rush you out and turn your table. I really hate that. (For more on how much I hate that, see my review for Emeril's.)Bottom line: Don't skip L\u00fcke if you come to New Orleans.", "Date": "2013-11-11", "Author_Location": "East Brunswick, NJ"}, {"Author": "Lon T.", "ReviewID": "9Z-qJ6qARFVq60eIAgjD7Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Awesome lunch here while in for Jazzfest. \u00a0Kicked things off with the Seafood Gumbo and it was loaded with shrimp and oysters. \u00a0I also tasted the crab bisque and it was excellent. \u00a0Did their homemade pasta with shrimp for my main and it was a winner. \u00a0Solid service and hope to get back for dinner or their brunch.", "Date": "2014-05-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Patricia S.", "ReviewID": "jJLkpU7jpOaQFMuNv-ai_g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We really enjoyed Luke.

We arrived a little early so we sat at the bar. I wanted to stick to a rum drink since that was what I had earlier that afternoon. So the bartender made me a special hurricane with fresh fruit. The bar area is really nice. The place is really nice and d\u00e9cor is very warm and classy. We were starving so right off the bat we ordered a salad with fried oyster, bacon, romaine & avocado salad. OMG I am not a fan of oysters but fried oysters are amazing! especially in a fresh delicious salad. I had a cup of crab & corn bisque and I wish I had ordered a bowl instead. It was so warm and the flavor of crab and corn are great together. By this time we were so excited to order our entr\u00e9es. Since I LOVE mussels I had to order Moules ET frites- this was mussels steamed with garlic & thyme (AMAZING) with house-made fries. I was afraid I would not be full but they loaded me up with mussels. My fianc\u00e9 ordered Jumbo Louisiana shrimp \"en cocotte\" roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages and of course I had to steal a little. It was made to perfection. I think by far this was one of the best places we visited in N.O. They made my top list. If you are ever in the area make sure you stop by. I heard happy hour is great here.

We asked him for lemon with our water and he forgot after multiple queries, and we actually asked 3 different waiter/waitresses/servers for lemon and they all forgot, though our main waiter eventually remembered and brought the lemon to us in the middle of our meal. \u00a0The final straw in this terrible haystack was his apathy and rude demeanor at the end of our meal--after taking my credit card and charging for the meal, he walked by our table and threw the credit card/receipt pad so that it plopped on our table and said \"here you go\" and continued walking away like he didn't care. \u00a0Overall, it seemed like he did not really care for his job and was there just going through the motions. \u00a0I was surprised that a restaurant of Luke's stature hired a waiter like this, as with an appropriate waiter and appropriate service, this meal would have been phenomenal. \u00a0Unfortuntely, the service left us in a sour mood despite the quality of the food. \u00a0If the service would have matched the food, Luke would have deserved a 4 or 5 stars in my mind, but because of the poor service we received, I gave the restaurant 2/5 stars.", "Date": "2014-02-23", "Author_Location": "Columbus, OH"}, {"Author": "Albert W.", "ReviewID": "A6he5DyZj8fkpKquCJs2Eg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We came here for happy hour for the oysters and it was lovely. \u00a0Drinks were tasty and the raw oysters were so divine, we had to get another dozen. \u00a0Too bad our waiter never came back with them. \u00a0Great food and drinks, not so great service.", "Date": "2014-03-11", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Sarabecca L.", "ReviewID": "dVNb_LbhBA7lRgB1H66p7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been to Luke many times and always enjoyed the food.

A man true to his words! We were very thankful. A few mins later, he came back, apologized again and made us even a bigger offer. He said since we didn't like the oysters, he would triple what we ordered. We each would get an order of their pork shank and roasted chicken (we are a party of three and that's six entrees)! We didn't know what to say! They definitely put the costumers first and care about the QUALITY of their food. The BBQ pork shank was delicious, the meat was cooked just right, it was tender and juicy. The roasted chicken was very special, and the meat literally melted in my mouth.

So I'll try to be delicate and say this the right way...John, you need to spend less time in front of the camera and more time in your restaurant. Staying in the Hilton for a week netted me many opportunities to dine here. I experienced two brunches, a few happy hours and many just-before-closing cocktails. Each time was a different experience but the bad easily outweighed the good. Both of our breakfasts here were terribly disappointing. For breakfast one I sampled the \"Eggs in a Jar\" which, for $22, is not really that great. It consists of 5 shrimp stuffed into a jar with jalape\u00f1o cheese grits and eggs. Yup, eggs, shrimp, cheese and grits for $22. Oh, I forgot the jar. But you don't get to keep the jar. The dish was actually ordered by a table-mate and when it first came out, the eggs were not just undercooked, they were not cooked at all. My Korean friend who eats the snottiest eggs I've seen anyone eat had to send it back. My \"Healthy Start\", which was house-made granola and fruit on yogurt was sparse at best. The granola was sticky and chewy, not crunchy at all, and while the yogurt was delicious, it wasn't good enough to salvage my image of this $12 dish. I'll say this, the coffee was good. At $6 for a double espresso, it better be. Oh, and the beignets were proper, even though they sent out the wrong sauce with them. Our second breakfast here allowed me to sample one of the $14 biscuit sandwiches - the sausage, egg and cheese biscuit served with a cup of fruit. My North Carolina friends make better biscuits in Portland, and load them up with all sorts of meats, gravies, eggs and what-not for half the price. The biscuit here has decent flake and is fairly buttery, but it didn't stand up to the small sausage patty and cheese. One word comes to mind when I think about what I paid for this dish - ludicrous. One member of my table ordered the home fries and when they came with meat in them (no mention of meat on the menu), she sent them back and said \"I actually am fine without these\". Instead of just taking them off the bill, they sent back potatoes minus the meat. \"But we don't want these\" we said. \"Oh you'll like them, trust me.\" she said as she walked off... and left them on the bill. \u00a0Despite two food issues with each of our meals (not cheap meals mind you) no apologies, comps, or any other customer service was offered either time. How much balls does it take to not even verbally apologize for such an expensive dish sent out totally wrong? Especially since we're pretty nice in our response/request to have them re-done?My bar experiences here were quite opposite to my meal experiences. Any time I could find a seat at the bar and order a drink, it was decent, and priced well. The whiskey list is short but there's some good stuff on there. The bartenders are friendly. The $.50 oysters and half-priced drinks at HHour are an insane deal. So it makes me wonder. Why go to lengths to offer such an amazing deal at HHour and good service at the bar, and then offer poor service and bad value for those wiling to sit down and spend more for a meal? Who knows. While I think this is a mighty fine hotel bar, as a restaurant it fails on value, on service, and frankly on quality of food. Had I been faced with half the prices, I might find this fare to be passable, but at the sky-high menu prices, I'd expect much, much more. I'm sure John Besh (if he ever reads these - probably not) doesn't expect his restaurant to be run this way. But c'mon. You send out completely see-through, uncooked eggs in a $22 egg dish and offer not even a verbal apology when the food is returned, let alone any other customer service on a $100 brunch for 4 people (no cocktails ordered)?! Yikes. We wouldn't have returned for an actual meal after the first visit for breakfast but had to grab grub on our last day on the way to the airport. Can't say I'd come back outside of happy hour.

My mother is a) a professional chef and b) a Jewish mother, and the matzo ball soup was almost the equal of hers: fluffy, peppery matzo balls, a superb rich broth, and delicious bits of roast chicken. When Kyle came by to check on us and I jokingly asked for a refill on the broth because I'd slurped it all up and had a giant matzo ball left to go through, he whisked away and came back a few minutes later with more broth--for which we weren't charged, even though it was practically the equivalent of another whole bowl of soup!

Such a good burger, covered in onions, bacon and swiss cheese, it was one of the better burgers I've had recently. The house-made fries it comes with were also insanely good - nice and salty and piping hot and crispy. We also got the Poultry Gran-mere ($19), which was also delicious.

They had that lovely quality where the salty, sea taste lingers in your mouth. So delicious and fresh. Horse radish sauce and cocktail sauce on the side.I ordered one of the two house beers - L\u00fcke Alt - amber on draft. Really nice, not too heavy but with good amber flavor.

It wasn't that big of a deal, though, and probably only really noticeable because I was sitting at the bar right in front of one of the TVs.Orgasmically good is the only way I can describe the dessert. Sooo-ooooh good. I ordered the bittersweet chocolate mousse with dulce de leche ice cream. That is a decadent combination; the ice cream melts on top of the mousse, which is almost like a gooey brownie - and the sweetness of the ice cream complemented the bittersweet chocolate flavor.With this top notch atmosphere, food, beer and oysters, I'm giving L\u00fcke Restaurant the 5 stars it deserves.", "Date": "2013-05-19", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Carmen C.", "ReviewID": "U3y7rPNg4pBbHMXYE8r86g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the French 75 cocktail only.....the BEST in NOLA, hands down!My girlfriends and I stayed at the HIlton and had so many great restaurants on our list that we never even considered dining at Luke.

Once we got them, the drinks were good, though the Riverbend lacked promised notes of basil. My strawberry something-or-other was tasty. The app was some kind of tart with onions and pork, and it was nice, with a lot of smoke in the pork. Several chunks were pure fat, they got left on the plate. Need a little meat with that fat and smoke.Entreewise, the shrimp and grits was amazing. The two stars comes in right here: I had a special, which was drum, delicious, part of the dish was a fried squash blossom stuffed with crawfish. Nothing wrong with it except the fry oil was clearly too cold and the thing was greasy as all get-out. When our server checked with us (his assistant tossed our entrees at us so fast that there was NO CHANCE of getting a drink to have with dinner, despite empty glasses) I told him about the squash blossom issue, pointing to the offending item on my bread plate. He was somewhat apologetic, but offered no remedy. He followed up with us on our meal, saying, \"except for the squash blossom, how was everything else?\" Seriously? Strike two!I know the server can't be blamed for the mistakes of the kitchen, but he can make it right, once the wrong is corrected. Besides pointing out the greasy squash blossom, could I have done anything differently? All I wanted was a refire of the greasy component.

We had the misfortune of being served by Kyle, who is hands down the most inept waiter we have ever encountered.

My colleague ordered everything in oysters, and I mean everything. While he slurped away, I fell in love with my bisque. How can something so decadent and buttery, still taste light and sweet? Our drinks did not arrive during this wonderful appetizer round, though. That they had a crowd was putting it mildly. It's at these moments you can take in the decor: that being warm and relaxed, which I also loved. Our table was located very close to 3 other diners: I could have grabbed a handful of pickles from each of them. When our main meal arrived we were not disappointed. The cracked crab was amazing; amazing enough for all to worship at it's altar; it was coupled with a light slaw that was not knee deep in mayo; but spicy and tangy and on my plate it was gone! It came with a grilled stuffed tomato that was loaded with a crab and cheese mixture with a definite kick! Awesome.My colleague ordered what many seemed to be ordering: the crab bit; in addition to fried green tomatoes. He seemed to have no complaints because he leveled his plate.Our drinks came at the end of the meal, and it's a good thing too because by then our pH levels had altered dramatically.

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with lump crab meat, roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.One wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging.

Our bartender friend informed us that this particular burger was chosen as 8th in the nation; I'm not sure by whom, but I'm not mad I got it, just mad I'm not on the committee. The shrimp and grits are also apparently a specialty of the house. We were told that they do them a bit differently than most places; as far as I can tell, they just cook the shrimp perfectly, and make the sauce good enough to drink. I was a bit disappointed that the fries were cooked past crispy into crunchy territory, but the lady on my left loved them all the same. For me though, the only downsides were said fries and the fact that their bloody mary is merely a mix (although I do like the Gator Blood), and they don't provide a spicy bean.

I'm not sure what the current obsession is with gel\u00e9e but at least this top layer of gel\u00e9e melted when it touched my tongue.Choucro\u00fbte for those of you who are not familiar can be best described as a cast iron pot of meats slowly and meticulously braised to a tender mound of goodness atop a thick layer of caramelized sauerkraut. I assure you, it's nothing pretty to look at. I imagine this would be what I'd eat if I was a man's man during medieval France. It was ALL meat. Meaty tender goodness. Slightly sweet meat from the caramelized potatoes and sauerkraut. Meat that fell apart from the scooping of my fork. The immensity of the meat taunted me and challenged me and I certainly would not have been a \"man\" unless I finished the whole thing...well I AT LEAST had to keep eating until I finished the wine. :)I'd never tried duck egg cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. In fact, it never occurred to me to make cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with anything other than a (chicken) egg. Interestingly, it was not unlike cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, yet it was...different. Richer maybe. More... like it was made with an egg that could very well have just popped out of the ducky sitting in the back kitchen. Not too sweet, creamy, served room temperature as it should be. The berries were fresh and sweet and was the end to a very near perfect dinner. The service was attentive, the server was knowledgeable about the food and wine, and the atmosphere-fun. If you're ever in New Orleans, this one is not a \"must have\" but a \"you definitely can't go wrong\".

Luke was my first John Besh experience. We were excited to enjoy a late dinner after the parades and were hoping to enjoy some oysters. Enjoy some oysters, we did. Unfortunately, our service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter was inattentive and did not seem to know much about the menu, which was disappointing as we found it a bit daunting. We worked out what we were going to order and from there on out, things were not awesome. Our food and drinks came in a baffling order. We received our oysters first, then our drinks, then a burger, then salad and gumbo. This would have been fine if there was a minute break between each part of the meal, but unfortunately it was more like 10 minutes.The worst part of the meal was the bibb lettuce salad I ordered. When I received the salad, it was made of brown romaine. I was so baffled that I asked the waiter if it was the right salad. He had no idea, so I just requested a cup of gumbo to match the 3 other cups of gumbo at our table. The waiter returned 5 minutes later without gumbo. They had run out...what? We eventually had a bus boy track down our waiter to get the check, which included the salad. Our waiter took the salad off but never seemed to acknowledge that anything out of the ordinary had happened during our meal. On the way out, we overheard two waiters talking about how desperate they were for Mardi Gras to be over. As someone who has experience Mardi Gras more than once, I can understand how it would be a nightmare for a service employee. For this, I give Luke a bit of a pass for the awful service. Overall, with the exception of the salad, the food was quite good.

However, as it often happens with these mollusks, flavor is inversely proportional to size. Apart from a nice, mineral aftertaste, I found the oysters to be bland, and the meat too soft. This oyster probably gives its best when fried.The entree of the day was fried Mangalitsa pork loin with Belgian waffle, pecan butter, and bacon-apple hash ($15). The dish was impeccably executed: the meat was perfectly fried on the outside, and nice and tender on the inside; the presentation in a skillet was quite pleasing.

I had heard about Luke Restaurant and the $.50 P&J Oysters for happy hour (3-6p everyday) from Yelpers before I traveled to NOLA this past weekend and decided that I had to try this place before I left. I love raw oysters, but being from Houston, the closest thing we get to fresh raw oysters are those from Galveston... and I'm not into the whole \"flesh-eating-bacteria\" thing. Needless to say, I try to avoid food poisoning from some of the seafood on our end of the Gulf. Luke... OH LUKE RESTAURANT. (Must still be the aphrodisiacs talking). Ha. My boyfriend and I came to Luke's with every intention to order the $.50 oysters and cocktails for happy hour (3-6pm everyday). However, after perusing the menu we saw Luke's \"le plateau de fruits de mer\" and had to order it. This platter is like a seafood heaven for seafood lovers. We started with two bloody mary's, ordered a bunch of seafood, and ended the night with a cappuccino and hot tea. The bloody mary's were good and the best part, is they were half price! Their cocktail menu features drinks ranging from their take on the peach bellini to stronger beverages of choice like scotch or french75's. Luke's has a cocktail menu that should please all high class taste buds. Now onto the main meal, picture this; a two-level tower exquisitely displaying 12 plump raw oysters, 8 huge shrimp, 5 clams, 12 sweet mussels, Alaskan King crab legs, dungeonous crab legs/body & squid/octopus ceviche with lemons, and saltines scattered around this goodness all for $58. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Not only did we completely pig out on this tower, but we also ordered a half dozen baked/roasted oysters (A MUST TRY for anyone who loves oysters). Let's start with the raw oysters, these things were gigantic and so fresh. No grimy fishy taste and we slurped these up without hesitation. The baked oysters were fantastic. I can't even find the words to describe them, they've got this lightly salted, buttery, bread crumb topping and the oysters are baked to perfection. Their texture is still reminiscent of a raw oyster, but without all the \"slime/juice.\" And, they're hot hot hot fresh outta the oven. Yum! The Alaskan King crab legs were not salty at all (which is a very good thing in my books). I hate it when king crab legs taste like saltwater, these crab legs at Luke had the fresh sweet taste of crab not compromised by seasonings or salt and I'm a huge fan. In fact, I'm dreaming about this whole meal as I speak. If you're only in NOLA for a day and need some good food and drinks, come to Luke for happy hour.

It is in the John Besh Restaurant Group, a French bistro with German influences (an homage to Kolb's, a long-standing German restaurant that was located in the CBD). L\u00fcke is moderately priced and offers something for all tastes (as long as you are not a vegetarian, but it is pescetarian friendly). The prices for lunch and dinner are similar, so it is an even better value for dinner than lunch.My favorite item on the menu is the L\u00fcke burger- with Emmenthaler cheese, bacon, caramelized onions lettuce, tomato. This burger is HUGE- do not hesitate to split with another diner. The burger is accompanied with thin crispy fries served in a mint julep cup. If you split the burger, they will bring each diner his/her own cup! I used to work close to L\u00fcke, so I have eaten this burger too many times to count. It is my favorite hamburger in New Orleans.Another favorite item on the menu is the flamenk\u00fcche- a thin tarte with caramelized onions, Emmenthaler cheese, and bacon. This Alsacien onion tarte satisfies all cravings- it is crispy, salty, sweet, creamy, and cheesy. It is a perfect appetizer to split among two people during happy hour, or between several people prior to a meal. Other starters of note are the pat\u00e9 of Louisiana rabbit and duck livers (brought in a small glass mason jar) and the slow poached yard egg salad.I have enjoyed many other items on L\u00fcke's menu, many of which are ideal for seafood lovers: the fresh gulf fish (my preference is served meuni\u00e8re), the crabmeat ravioli, and the moules et frites are all great choices. L\u00fcke has great daily specials. The Friday special, a redfish \"court-bouillon\" (a seafood stew served with rice) is my favorite and an excellent rendition of this classic Louisiana dish. There is also an extensive \"raw bar\" selection if you enjoy cold, fresh seafood.L\u00fcke also has an interesting wine selection (served in juice glasses, reminiscent of how people once enjoyed wine in their homes) and fantastic cocktails. If you enjoy bellinis, don't miss L\u00fcke's champagne au peche. Also, L\u00fcke serves the best French 75 in New Orleans- a perfect combination of cognac, lemon juice, and champagne, garnished with a brandied cherry. L\u00fcke's happy hour is a well-kept secret- \u00a01/2 price drinks and .50 oysters from 3-6.

a young man who managed what appeared to be the entire front room without difficulty and maintained the demeanor of someone trained under the Thomas Keller Empire - the service would be perfect throughout. \u00a0Bread was timely, coffee and water refills spot on, plate descriptions accurate thorough, and all done with a friendly down-to-earth demeanor and a smile. \u00a0Going over the daily special with me I was left to decide while he went to get my coffee.Listening to the room - lively but not loud despite the parade going by in the street - I labored over the menu for some time because everything sounded quite good - essentially bistro fare with a southern twist. \u00a0Returning with the coffee - a great thick blend with a bit of chicory but more prominently cocoa notes (I'm rather certain the same as that at August) I decided to go with the \"express lunch\" special - a $15 soup and main combo plus an added appetizer. \u00a0Smiling my server told me I'd made a great choice and slipped away to serve his other tables.Arriving shortly after my order was placed - yet another crispy and golden French loaf, this time served with a delightful and grassy salted butter. \u00a0While the bread was not quite as delicious as that at Clancy's it was my second favorite of the trip and the butter put it over the top - thankfully I limited myself to just the one loaf because it turns out Luke's \"deal\" lunch is not for the faint of heart (or stomach.)Arriving first, my soup - the daily special of crawfish bisque. \u00a0Clearly tomato and cream based with heavy spicing and ample crawfish the dish was unlike any bisque I've ever tasted, but certainly not a gumbo either. \u00a0Loaded with chunks of fresh crawfish and spicy without being \"hot\" I liked the bisque and as it would turn out (oddly) to be my only experience with crawfish on the trip I was glad I'd chosen it even though I likely would have preferred the daily gumbo.My second dish, an addition to the prix fixe, was the Foie Gras - quite frankly, if a place is offering a terrine of Foie I'm probably going to order it. \u00a0Presented elegantly this terrine proved not only good, but exemplary. \u00a0Featuring a thick cut of slow cooked terrine painted on all sides with a Gew\u00fcrztraminer reduction, topped with micro greens and a coarse sea salt, and drizzled with thick and sweet balsamic I can favorably compare this $16 preparation to the $30 supplemented version served at The French Laundry - though it wasn't quite as airy or delicate. \u00a0 Served with toasted brioche (I was brought more on request) and beautifully textured I would strongly recommend any fan of cold foie to visit Luke for the experience.Arriving next was the daily special - having looked at the menu I was surprised when it arrived because I expected a sandwich...but the surprise was the good kind...the really good kind. \u00a0In describing their cochon du lait prep my server told me how the slow roast pork is reduced down similar to pulled pork and then \"rehydrated\" with a dairy, onion, and garlic reduction (plus the chef's special spices) and then pan fried crispy on top. \u00a0If that description doesn't do it for you - try it...almost a sweet yet creamy pork meatloaf with a crispy and salty skin akin to pork belly. \u00a0Accompanying the pork on the plate were not only the advertised stewed greens and vinegar laden cherry mustard, but also a hefty helping of cornbread dressing. \u00a0Call it bistro food, call it soul food, call it comfort food - I call it one of the most unexpectedly delicious dishes I've had in some time.Asking me if I was interested in dessert I told him I didn't even need the menu - just bring the bread pudding.Arriving about 15 minutes later as I read a complimentary copy of the New York Times the bread pudding was an absolute masterpiece - the best traditional bread pudding I've ever tasted. \u00a0Described simply as cinnamon raisin bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce the complexities of the dish were astounding for a bread pudding - piping hot with the smooth and creamy ice cream slowly melting the bread pudding itself was marvelous in custard/bread ratio and the sauce had minimal alcoholic kick while instead focusing on notes of caramel, pecan, cinnamon, and what may have even been honey. \u00a0Having had a whole lot of bread pudding in my time this was undoubtedly my favorite non-chocolate version to date.", "Date": "2010-02-24", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Godwin C.", "ReviewID": "_5mR1Sy9mwE7qppqtgtYug", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is for the HAPPY HOUR only.Lum had a chance to leave early from work so we decided to take advantage of the opportunity and actually make it in time for a happy hour special. \u00a0Hard to pass up on $0.50 oysters and half-off drinks, amirite? Fun new fact, at least for me: P&J oysters (the ones offered for Luke's happy hour) are from a local oyster shucking company in New Orleans. I still have so much to learn about this city.FOOD: Oyster heaven (at least in quantity).Over the course of our stay, the two of us ordered six-dozen oysters. The majority of them were on the smaller side, but thats probably more a result of the oil spill ramifications than anything else. However, what Luke can control is the amount of water still left in the shells. To an extent, all oysters will have some water residue as a result of cleaning, but these were literally soaked in water to the point where slurping the oysters down wasn't really an option since you'd get a mouthful of liquid to go with them. On the plus side, they were very clean. I was also hoping for another sauce besides the basic cocktail and horseradish, but it wasn't as big of a deal as the water issue.Lum's mint julep was definitely on the strong side so depending on your drinking preferences this can be a positive or negative. Luke has a couple in-house brews available as well, and the Luke Fru (blonde) I tried was actually pretty decent as far as blondes go: \"wheat-ie\" taste, smooth finish.SERVICE: Professional but absent-minded and over-extended.Our server was nice, engaging, quick with jokes, and seemed like he knew what he was doing. The problem was that it looked like he was the only server for the entire front room so it took awhile to get anything from him. Even when he seemed like he had a spare moment it was almost impossible to get his attention. Case in point, I was more than willing to order at least another drink or two and another two dozen oysters from him, but with all the long waits in-between service (drink sitting empty 15 minutes, finished oysters on table 10 minutes) happy hour was unfortunately over and we had other engagements. From my viewpoint, it looks like they need more staff.While the staffing issue is pretty much uncontrollable by the staff on the floor, short-changing customers on oysters is not. Good thing I counted our oyster orders because we were short four on the first order of two dozen. That's pretty unacceptable, but kudos to our server for taking care of it and adding the missing ones to our next order.ATMOSPHERE: Like stepping back in time.I like it. Newspapers hanging from wood poles at different sections of the restaurant, cherry wood everywhere, hunting trophy head over the bar, sweet bar stools. With the music playing overhead it felt like a scene from Boardwalk Empire. It's one of those restaurants where someone could have a nice relaxing meal but it wouldn't seem out of place to see higher-society types getting a little boisterous. Noise suits Luke.RELATIVITY: How does it compare to expectations and other restaurants in its class?Slightly not as good as expected, especially when considering the class of restaurant that Luke is embracing. \u00a0One glance at their regular dinner menu and it's clear what type of clientele they are catering to and what style of dining they're wanting to provide. The quality didn't match up with the expectations, I guess.OVERALL: Three stars overall, no bonus for relativity.This is probably one of the best happy hour deals you're going to see in the city value-wise, but if a place wants to convince me to come back for a dinner experience then even the nitty-gritty parts of happy hour should be up to snuff.

Excellent horse raddish - creamy and strong.*** Gumbo..... very beautiful dark roux which shows that the cooks have trully mastered it.

Thus it was our first stop immediately upon arrival.Unfortunately, none of us ate raw oyster ($0.50 each from 3-6 pm), so that novelty was lost on us. However, it's half-price drinks, whether at the bar or at a table. Very nice!Luke itself seems like a place that's confused as to whether it's a restaurant or a bar. It ends up coming across a place that looks like a fancy eatery in an amusement park. I think it could fit right in at EPCOT. The service, uniformly, was pretty bad. The hostess had a bit of a pointed attitude when we were picking between table or bar. The bartender completely ignored us when we first sat at the bar. And the waitress, overall, was just average with nary a smile.The food itself is quite delicious. We just missed the lunch menu, but the dinner prices aren't wholly ridiculous when you're just sampling. We started with a dozen jumbo shrimp from the \"raw bar,\" which were huge, well-seasoned, and quite possibly the best seafood we had in New Orleans. That was complemented by a side of frites, well crisped and salted.That was followed by a hearty bowl of gumbo, because, well, we had just made it into New Orleans. And in NOLA, you gotta try the gumbo. The stock was quite tasty, but a bit light on the additionals. We ended with a bockwurst, a truly large portion of wurst that completely stuffed the table and is great value at just $10.On the drink side, the girlfriend went with a streetcar, well made, and I tried the custom-brewed amber. Yup, custom-brewed beers make a nice touch.While the service was unimpressive and the decor was not to my liking, I'm a fan of the food.

My pronunciation did not sound graceful, or tasteful, and so I quickly ordered a glass of Riesling to hide my embarrassment. I really wasn't a big fan of this poorly named tart, the bacon had too much smoky flavor and was a bit grisly. The onions were decent, but you better love them because there are a LOT. These same onions were the most prevalent thing on my husband's burger as well. This includes an onion bun and the same thick, smoky, bacon. So don't order the burger if you got the Flamen k\u00fcche, it's a little too repetitive. My meal was pretty tasty, I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp with some grilled veggies.

First of all, even though a dinner reservation had been made, we were banished to the very VERY back room, passed the first back room, to the absolute most desolate corner table in the restaurant. In said desolate- corner-table-restaurant-abyss, there was no music, no boisterous laughing, and no clinking of glasses and silverware as one would expect from a popular restaurant. Instead, it was just us three and the awkward table of three men seated next to us. I realize this is not really grounds for a one star review. So let me tell you about the service and the food. Our waiter (who took at least 10 minutes to get us a glass of water) forgot our beer order three times. He asked us twice what we had ordered, then brought the wrong beer on his third trip to our table. He did have a small green order pad in his hand, that he apparently forgot about as well. Writing down the drink order could have saved us all a lot of time. I ordered the daily gulf fish special, which was nothing special at all. Just fried fish atop three brussel sprouts and a few small potatoes. One friend ordered the duck confit and white bean cassoulet. I did not try it, but it was basically an entire sausage and duck leg atop very dry and very salty white beans and bread crumbs. She only ate about three bites (which went unnoticed by our waiter). Friend #2 ordered the steak and frites which was the one somewhat redeeming part of the meal. It was cooked rare (to her liking) so at least the dinner wasn't a total bust.

The French 75.I'm sure that their other cocktails are also good, but you will have to check that out for yourself. .You see...Luke is where I fell in love with the French 75.

It makes me want to try making rillettes myself. The marmalades went so well with the rillettes. I think this is probably what Besh is best at: finding flavors that go together so well but that you don't necessarily think of as accompanying one another.- Shrimp Farci over corn and field pea succotash and Hollandaise.

The portions are huge, which I like, because I love having delicious leftovers. From this visit I took home leftovers from each course. I was a happy child the next day.My second visit was some time in early October. It was another Saturday night and I was on a date.

If this place isn't in the mix for best burger in the city, then something is terribly wrong in the universe. The signature burger here, the Luke burger, is quite simply amazing.

Then they top the burger with melted cheese and a heap of delicious caramelized onions. If you want mayo, mustard or ketchup then you get little individual bottles on the side so you can add them to taste. Add some great lightly fried and salted french fries on the side and you have one amazing meal. (For extra points, you can even spice up the ketchup with the Tabasco sauce that is on every table, but I understand that not everyone likes their food as spicy as I do.)This restaurant is a little on the spendy side, but they do have an Express menu to help keep the cost down a little. For $23, which is very reasonable for the quality of the establishment, you can have a cup of soup, the entree of the day, and a dessert.

I had wanted to try Luke for awhile now, but we couldn't get down to NO until this month.. Luke made it worth the wait.. My wife and I love France and the food, while Luke is a mix of classic French and German flair the French side is definitely the shining star here.. The decor is a bit simplistic, but in a good way. Light colored hardwoods and shared bench seating are both warm, comfortable and inviting.The menu is is a bit German, a good amount of French and a splash of Creole added. We started out with the gumbo which was perfectly balanced and seasoned well. I'm not a seafood lover and I have to say this was the best gumbo I have ever tasted, my wife agreed. Oh before I forget.. The French bread and butter were done so well it would have made Lionel Poilane smile..For mains my wife had the crab ravioli and I had the ribeye, both were excellent.The pasta looked and tasted handmade and the sauce was creamy yet delicate, while the crab was fresh and large.The ribeye I had was great, I want to address the comment below about \u00a0the ribeye being mostly fat.. Ribeyes are just that, a well marbled cut of meat which lends itself well to being slow roasted (Prime rib, Standing rib roast) when grilled the fat will be more prominent especially at lower temps.. Maybe he got a bad cut, but knowing your proteins is half the battle.. Back to the steak, I enjoyed my ribeye and the presentation on a wooden cutting board is a nice touch, however I did not care for the b\u00e9arnaise sauce.. The fries were a bit salty for me, but I'm a hypersensitive to course salts so some might like them.. After brushing the salt off the taste was spot on and tasted like they were fried in a good oil not just plain ole veg.For dessert we split the bread pudding and were pleasantly surprised at the souffle style presentation.. The taste was good, however the ice cream could use some work and I would try another dessert next time.. Even with the ice cream, it's still a very, very good dessert, I'm just more of a chocolate lover.. Drinks at Luke are AMAZING! It's not the typical NO drinks, these are high end fine cocktails.. The French 75 is well worth the price of admission and the brandied cherries that are put in random drinks are out of this world good.. Also, any time someone goes to the trouble to put a super high end Italian steam pump espresso machine in his restaurant I'm impressed..

But once there, I realized how much more this small spot really offered, so much so that we came back a second time, making our first and last meals of the trip both John Besh meals (wait, our last meal was lunch at August, but that counts too!).I don't need to tell you about the oysters- as other people have said, they're large, very clean, and super fresh, and were even worth it without the happy hour special. And the cocktails were really fantastic too -- perfect mint juleps, and I also enjoyed my Absinthe Suissette, even though I'm not a huge absinthe fan in general. My biggest surprise was the rest of the food-- I'm not a huge fan of German food (too heavy and have had lots of bad spatzle in my lifetime, too), but I love what Besh is doing here, with the German-Franco bistro fare. A note for all- two people dining is NOT ENOUGH to really enjoy the goodness this place has to offer. Our first time, my partner and I ordered just a dozen oysters and the rabbit and duck liver pate, thinking it would be a small meal. WRONG. I couldn't believe it when they brought out a mason jar full of pate, with bread and full housemade condiments (relishes, mustard) to boot. My guilt at wasting food nearly made me sick, trying to finish the pate (we failed). Silly us, we made an even worse mistake the second trip, splitting the hogshead cheese, cochon du pied, dozen oysters, AND a croque madam! The croque madam was split in half, and each of us got a full order of fries each, even though we'd asked to split one order! Total fail again.. but what a magnificent fail it was. Everything perfectly cooked, with friendly and prompt service to boot even late at night. The prices were more than reasonable, though we did stick mainly to starters, cocktails, and those oysters and shared everything.

A great choice. Not a fan of the pickled watermelon rind though. The stone ground mustard was a great condiment to add to the the bread. For entrees I ordered the ribeye steak and fries. The steak came out perfect. Med. rare, warm hot pink center and crunchy crust on the outside. It had a large pat of garlic butter on top. Steak sauce NOT needed. The fries were good. I had read somewhere that they were fried in \"duck fat\"? The waitress said, no. Where did I get that idea? I did not like the mini bottle of ketchup and mayo. Wanted a larger quantity I guess.My wife ordered the shrimp and grits. A tasty dish, although not a large portion like I have seen at other restaurants. She enjoyed it and we shared our dishes with each other. For dessert we ordered the gateau basque cake and a chocolate mousse of which I cannot recall the name. The cake was fantastic.

The service was top quality, despite our huge party.The bread that was given prior to the 1st dish had an outer crust that was firm, yet crisp. The inside of the bread was soft and carried a light flakiness.The 1st dish was a blue crab bisque. The bisque had a medium consistency and packed a bold flavor. Each spoonful was filled with the crab's distinct taste, but left my pallet with a light spice. Personally, I felt like the bisque lacked in a balance of flavor that I was expecting and was a bit too salty. Perhaps that crab and saltiness could have been tapered down a bit.For the 2nd dish, I had shrimp and andouille over creamy white grits. The dish gave off a wondrous aroma. The shrimp was not as \"jumbo\" as I expected them to be, but each packed a flavorful punch. The shrimps carried that bold, Cajun flavor but was not overwhelming. The grits balanced out the the shrimp by providing that neutral flavor to refresh the pallet.For dessert, I had bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce. Flavor explosion can be used to describe this dessert. The pecan sauce was very rich, but was balanced out with the vanilla bean ice cream, and both matched well with the bread pudding canvas.

According to the website, it is Besh' \"homage to the grand old Franco-German brasseries that once reigned in New Orleans.\"We made reservations for 5:30 and we're greeted and seated promptly upon arrival. Our waiter was Lee, who had been on vacation for a little while. It showed. More on that later. I decided to order the nightly 3-course pri-fixe special. My wife decided to choose her own. First off for me was seafood gumbo \u00e1 la Creole. The gumbo itself had good flavor, but some of the rice was burnt and one of the oysters had a lot of grit.My wife ordered the Shrimp Bisque. It was very flavorful and enjoyable. With a velvety consistency.For my entree I had the navarin d'agneau braised lamb with gnocchi and Covey Rise vegetables. I had never had braised lamb before. It was okay, but needed more seasonings. Unfortunately, the stars of the dish were the supporting cast: the gnocchi and vegetables.My wife had the shrimp farci (with blood orange hollandaise, crabmeat and shrimp). It was very enjoyable with the hollandaise really elevating the dish.Again, my meal came with 3 courses. We were both quite satiated at this point, but dessert came with the meal. The original bread pudding that came out had a hair on it. Immediately it was sent back to the kitchen. The manager apologized, and brought out two new desserts! TWO! We could only pick at each of them. The first was a \"gateau basque\" vanilla cake with blackberries and cr\u00e8me fraiche. We were split on this one; I enjoyed it, while my wife thought it was kind of boring for a dessert. The second dessert we were brought was a chocolate pot de creme. It was very enjoyable with some chocolate pieces on top adding to the texture play.As I mentioned earlier, we would come back to our waiter. Lee, though nice, would come by every 2 minutes to make sure everything was okay. The service was thus suffocating at best. We kept getting interrupted in the middle of our conversations due to him \"checking up\" on us. The food at L\u00fcke was decent, nothing that made me say WOW! But it seems like a good restaurant.

I really like the table I was seated at though. \u00a0Front room, back corner single table. \u00a0Perfect. My waiter (I'm looking at you, Bobby L.) approached the table with pretty much a Don't-Give-Two-Sh*ts attitude. \u00a0I know that this isn't August, and I wasn't expecting fine dining service but, at least be slightly congenial or relatively polite. \u00a0Thankfully he seemed to warm up ever so slightly so I at least felt as though I wasn't going to be suddenly abandoned. \u00a0Though that could've been because of the two couples that got seated next to me.The meal:$0.50 oysters from 3-6! \u00a0Yes! \u00a0Needless to say, I started off with a dozen oysters and a blanche du bruxelles. \u00a0Well, I would've started off with a dozen oysters if the duck and rabbit liver pat\u00e9 hadn't come out first. \u00a0When I say I'd like to start with the oysters and then have the pate, that's pretty much what I mean. \u00a0My table was small so it was very cramped with a tray of oysters and the pat\u00e9 set up. \u00a0While I'll admit that having that as a problem should really exhibit how lucky I am in life, I'm going to be a brat anyway. \u00a0Bobby delievered my oysters with no smile, no oyster fork and no lemons. \u00a0After waiting 5 minutes for him to come back around, I was able to get those things. \u00a0Regardless of that, the oysters were great quality and very tasty, but I did have to disconnect the muscle on almost all of them myself. \u00a0The pat\u00e9 was just fantastic. \u00a0Accompanied by bread and butter pickles, pickled watermelon rind, sweet relish, grainy mustard and toasted ciabatta slices - I devoured it.For dessert I had the maple pot de creme. \u00a0It was alright. \u00a0Not sublime, but not awful. \u00a0The texture was perfect but something about all the different flavors - the maple, the vanilla bean, the espresso caramel and candied pistachios - all sounded like they should've worked together but they just don't. \u00a0I guess I may have also been a little put off by the fact that it arrived in the same container type as the pat\u00e9 and had a simlar color to it. \u00a0I can't fault the dish for my brain's insistence that each bite was supposed to taste like pat\u00e9. \u00a0I know they're going for the whole down-home thing, but I think they could've come up with a better dish for the dessert. Overall, it was a decent experience. \u00a0If they could just amp up the service some, it would be a great experience. \u00a0That seems to be the common theme in the reviews I'm reading. \u00a0I would certainly hope that John Besh would want his customers treated better than the way I saw them being treated. \u00a0In the meantime, ask for a different waiter.", "Date": "2011-03-11", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Katherine B.", "ReviewID": "--wv2zzkhfVP3j1QcvdTzw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband and I came to this restaurant and decided to eat at the bar since there was a wait for a table.

These men can cook, create a menu, make the world whole once again. Rarely do I find a restaurant at which each of the three courses is executed in such flawless fashion. I started with the local oysters, which were some of the largest and sweetest I have ever tasted. I didn't even long for the mignonette which I have become accustomed to in New York; they required no added flavor besides the simple squeeze of a lemon. An order of peel and eat jumbo shrimp came on the same \"plateau\" and I couldn't have been happier. Possibly the most incredibly fresh and meaty shrimp I have ever had. For the entrees, I ordered the shrimp and crab \u00e9touff\u00e9e with fennel, saffron, and tagliatelle. This dish was rich and garlicky, but well portioned and perfectly balanced. The sauce was neither too thick nor too thin and acted as a nice compliment to the chunks of blue crab. I also tried some of the pork shank with sausage and house made sauerkraut. Now, sauerkraut is not something I'll usually write home about...it's more of a garnish or a faded memory of German home dinners to me. But this was different! It wasn't overly vinegary and had an almost sweetness that accompanied the meat instead of overpowering it. The pork was briny and fall off the bone tender, and the sausage (with a cherry mustard) was ground and packed so finely; almost the smooth texture of bologna, and amply spiced with nutmeg (perhaps even a bit TOO much nutmeg).I tried to resist dessert, but then I saw pecan bread pudding with ice cream and caramel and accepted my impending pant-size-up, plus coffee (with the freshest cream I've ever witnessed tableside). The bread pudding was soft and cinnamony, with sweetened pecans and the buttery thin caramel that just all melted in your mouth. No regrets (and I don't even normally eat gluten).I also ordered a sazerac. This led to no disappointment. In fact, the drink was so smooth, had I been feeling like getting into a bit of trouble, I would have had a few more.As a note: yes, I DID come back here again during my short 4 day trip.

I then started with the crawfish bisque, salty but delicious. Entree for me was the crabmeat ravioli. It started out tasting a little funny, but as I ate more I started to really enjoy it. What bothered me about that dish is the fact that the raviolis were all stuck together (the skin) but broken apart in the middle and all the stuffing was everywhere. My boyfriend had the ribeye with crabmeat on top (served on a cutting board). I think the ribeye would have been pretty average if it weren't for the delicious crab meat. For sides, I had the sauteed local vegetable, too oily but tasted good. My boyfriend had the fries that were really good but salty. I tried our friend's asparagus and it was good.

Our server was great, though I can't recall his name. We followed his lead and started our meal off with a 1/2 dozen oysters and the cochon balls which were fried. Literally these are pigs feet that are simmered for hours upon hours and finally balled up and pan fried. I can say without a doubt that I would recommend these to anyone who went to Luke. They melted in my mouth and were accompanied by a rich sauce. The oysters were fresh and in peak season. We were in agreement that these were the best oysters we had ever eaten. To continue our meal I had the shrimp and grits. These were the best shrimp and grits I had on my food tour of NOLA. The shrimp were succulent and the grits were creamy and smooth. My boyfriend ordered the pork shank. When it arrived we were shocked to see how large this entree was. The pork shank was the size of an infant and was accompanied by a house-made bratwurst, potatoes and huge chunks of pork belly. It was incredibly rich, but he demolished his dish. Since I was feeling good that the bf's meal was a great deal bigger than mine, I opted for dessert. At our server's recommendation, we ordered the Gateau Basque. Our server told us it was prepared by pouring the batter into a pan that was already heated up-clever. This makes for a crunchy, almost burnt crust and a soft, gooey interior. The manager also let us know that while the cake is baking it is injected with a syrup to keep it moist. Topped with candied citrus and creme fraiche, this was one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. It was the perfect balance of textures and flavors. Overall, the bf and I enjoyed Luke so much that we came back 2 more times on our NOLA vacation to take advantage of the 1/2 price oysters and drinks for happy hour.

After trying the vegetarian dish once (veggies and pasta), I asked our server to woo the chef into making me an original dish- most places take on this challenge with absolutely no compliant. What came out was- wait for it- pasta and veggies. Same dish, different noodles. My parents tried two different carnivorous meals and both said they were \"meh,\" especially after our previous meals that weekend. Overall, worth a shot if you're looking for a fun night and some new food. Irony is, after seeing the two things on the menu that we thought \"Who would get those at a place like this?\", we realized those should have been our orders. Their hamburgers and the ham and cheese sandwich looked good enough for a vegetarian to try! Mind you, I'd sub the ham for tomatoes, but they were exquisite!

Unfortunately, I was not much impressed. First of all, the service was extremely slow. It was just under 30 minutes from the time we sat down until our drinks arrived... and the rest of the meal followed the same unhurried theme. Luckily for us, we were celebrating a birthday with another couple, so we were happy to sit and talk for a couple of hours, but any other time, and I would definitely have been annoyed with the slow and inattentive service.The food was all good, but nothing spectacular. We started off with the assiette de charcuterie, which is an assortment of duck prosciutto, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and different relishes and mustards to accompany. It was all good. We also had the escargot au gratin... now this was the best part of the meal... it was delicious. The veal glace and red wine used to prepare it was mixed perfectly... and it was served with delicious bread for dipping, it was very good. For entre, I had the Jagerschnitzel, which contains paneed veal cutlets atop pasta, all covered in a mushroom sauce. The sauce was clearly underserved, with only a little on top of the veal, and not nearly enough for the pasta underneath. The pictures I saw here on Yelp of the same meal show quite a bit more sauce... so, with the little sauce that was on the plate, it left the meal rather bland. My wife had the shrimp and grits... I stole a bite, and that was all I wanted. You can get very good plates of shrimp and grits all over the city of New Orleans, and this was not one of them... For dessert, we split the bread pudding. Once again, it was ok, but nothing special. It had some vanilla ice cream on top and a pecan sauce... but once you got through the top layer, the bottom half of the bread pudding was bland and dry. We didn't finish it. BOTTOM LINE: It was ok... the service was slow and the food was moderate at best. I can think of 10 different places in the same price range and with a similar menu selection that I would rather go to, so it is unlikely that I will return to Luke.", "Date": "2012-06-09", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Jennifer W.", "ReviewID": "ROcDYugMrHoVoJH1q2Ln1w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't remember if I wrote a review for this gem back in fall 2010, and I'm too lazy to go look. In either case, both reviews - then and now - would and will share the same result: wonderful.In 2010, the week of Thanksgiving, I had the best-ever restaurant dining experience in my life. I was treating myself to a full dinner, and dining solo, I was a bit worried that service would be \"meh\" as it often is at finer places. Rather, my waiter was fantastic. When I told him I hadn't really had raw oysters before, but was curious, he fetched me two on the house to try out (resulting in something yummy!). And, when I had a little green organic visitor in my salad - showing that everything was extremely fresh - they took care of me. I didn't care much, as it wasn't something that signaled a lack of cleanliness. But, they swooped on in without a word, took my plate, and dashed off. The manager swung by, and apologized profusely, swearing that everything was 'taken care of'. And, he wouldn't let me argue (I seriously didn't mind paying!).Everything I had - a full five courses - was delectable. Not to mention, they made a darned good Old Fashioned.Since then, I've craved a return visit here.

I got there in the middle of their happy hour which is everyday (weekends too!) from 3-6pm and includes $.50 oysters and half-priced drinks (I think there are some that aren't, but many/most are). I sat at the bar, ordered a full dozen and a house beer, and found myself remiss to leave in time to hoof it way back to my room to shower and change for the wedding.Now, the oysters weren't as good as the ones I had two days before at Felix's, but... for $.50/ea. and decent conversation with the bartenders, it was a welcome stop at the end of a long, hot, tiring day.I will return again on my next trip.

The restaurant is lovely inside, and feels intimate because there are several rooms, even though the space is quite large when you combine all the spaces.

Pat\u00e9, head cheese, fois gras terrine, house-pickled watermelon rind and other pickles, stone ground mustard and plenty of toasts.Crabmeat saladMostly crab, served on greens, very lightly dressed. Sweetest crab I've ever eaten. Seriously.Fried Oyster and bacon salad with buttermilk dressingYes, there's lettuce, but the giant chunks of bacon and the most succulent fried oysters I've ever eaten sit atop this lettuce, and they don't skimp.Mussels and frietes I think this was like, 2 pounds of mussels in the best broth I've ever had. The fries were good but I enjoyed dunking the crusty bread that came with the salad and the waitress happily brought more. I think the kitchen staff was sort of amazed watching me eat ALL of this, and I am still not quite sure how I did it either. But I really like mussels.The L\u00fcke BurgerThis thing was huge, the bacon on it was amazing, and husband enjoyed finishing it back at the townhouse as a latenight snack.The service here was amazing.

The restaurant is on the ground floor of the Hilton in St. Charles St. in downtown \"Nawlins',\" as it's called. I'm from Ohio -- so, needless to say, I was on the search for some great creole and cajun food.It was fantastic!!! We had a small group, so we started with the cold seafood platter with oysters, clams, crab, shrimp, and mussels; and an assortment of pate, cheese and bread. WOW. Obviously the fresh oysters were fresh from the gulf -- you could taste it! The texture was light and ever-so-slightly salty. The other seafood was okay, so if I had to choose again, I'd just get more oysters. Great cold seafood bar! The rabbit pate was pretty good too, so be adventurous and try a few different items!I had recently made Shrimp and Grits at home, therefore decided to see what they actually tasted like in New Orleans. Not bad - mine were better. I think it's mostly because I liked my grits a little creamier. Theirs were lumpy and slightly dry. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned with what tasted like a little blackened seasoning. I prefer a more tomato and garlic approach. Nonetheless, they were still tasty and delicious.Again, since I was jonesin' for some cajun food, I had a cup of seafood gumbo as a side. Whoooowheeee, awesome! \u00a0It was very flavorful and had a decent amount of seafood. The bowl was completely empty... The service was impeccable on the Monday night I visited.

Not found here, at our table at least. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which was said to be a favorite, and I was extremely disappointed. It was SO salty, I was only able to take a few bites and had to stop eating. I really regret not sending it back but the service made me feel uncomfortable. So I basically paid $26 for a couple bites of sodium enhanced grits. Taste aside, the portion was also saddening. You get a little scoop of grits covered in too much sauce. While taking our orders, the waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad. Where I'm from, this signifies that it comes with the order. But not here. So each of us ordered a side and got charged $5 for it without even meaning to. Almost everyone else at my table had ordered a burger, which they seemed to enjoy very much. It came with fries which also seemed to have endured a heavy hand on the salt. Their large burgers with fries were much cheaper than my tiny plate of shrimp and grits.

My date and I tried one of John Besh's other restaurants, August Restaurant, and loved it so we figured that L\u00fcke would be great too. We had reservations at 8pm and was seated right away in the back part of the restaurant. Our server was helpful with the menu and very attentive. My date noticed particles floating around in the water glass the server was pouring from and notified him. The server replaced it right away. We shared the Terrine of Slow Cooked Foie Gras, which came with bread croutons. My date thought that the portion was really tiny (about 2 x 3 x 0.5 in), but it was plenty enough for the both of us. The bread croutons were fried, so they were soaked in oil... We tried it with the foie gras and all we could taste was the oil... so we told our server about this problem and he exchanged our fried bread croutons for toasted ones, which was MUCH better. We could taste the foie gras, which was light and creamy. There was a little bit of gelatin on the side that was for sweetening up the taste. The flavor is so rich and filling! We both enjoyed the foie gras very much, delicious! I ordered the J\u00e4gerschnitzel. It was okay, very light in flavor. I really enjoyed the taste of the pan\u00e9ed veal cutlet, very crunchy and mildly flavorful. However, I wished the sp\u00e4tzel (egg noodle type pasta) was more moist. It was rather dry, and I didn't taste much of the bacon mushroom sauce. The portion was huge though! I had to box up a quarter of it.My date ordered the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" and we read reviews about this dish being rather salty. Yes, a bit too much salt. The grits were really creamy and flavorful, and the shrimp tasted scrumptious! His dish had way more flavor in comparison to mine. I dipped my sp\u00e4tzel in his dish's sauce and it taste WAY better. However, my date said that after eating most of his dish, he was tired of eating it because it was too much of the same thing.For dessert, we shared the Baked Chocolate Mousse. I really, really love sweets and chocolate, so this dessert really hits the spot. The chocolate wasn't too overly sweet, and the mousse was so soft and creamy. Yum!Overall, enjoyed L\u00fcke, but not as much as August. There was a slight mishap with our food here. My date found a piece of blue crab in his dish and I found some sort of pork piece in my dish... My date was concerned about how the cooks in the back handled the food. He wondered, \"what if I were allergic to crab?? Then what??\" But he really didn't mind finding the piece of crab in his dish, it just shouldn't happen at a restaurant that's supposedly high-quality.

Who doesn't want to experience Reveillon when they're in NOLA?There's a lot that's good about this restaurant. There's also a lot that isn't quite up to par.Pros:- Happy Hour: 50-cent oysters? Pretty sure I died and went to heaven. And they were huge, succulent, deliciously briny Gulf Coast oysters! Some were easily twice the size of normal oysters- Delicious cocktails: Seeing as they were half off because of HH, I indulged and got both the Champagne au Peche (Champagne and fresh peach puree) and the St. Charles Streetcar (St. Germain, pear vodka, Champagne). Both were tasty and refreshingCons:- The Reveillon menu left a lot to be desired. For the first course, my boyfriend got the shrimp remoulade and I got the crispy sweetbread with beluga lentils and blood orange brown butter vinaigrette. The remoulade was flavorless and forgettable. The sweetbread was actually well-cooked (very crisp) but got to be too rich after a while. \u00a0 \u00a0 The turtle soup and seafood gumbo that made up our second course were both terrible. There was maybe a kernel of turtle meat in the entire bowl of soup and the gumbo lacked seasoning. Our third course consisted of crispy flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp and mirliton dressing, and a rib roast with oyster dressing, turnip and apple puree, and cherry compote. The roast was decent if a bit chewy, but the flounder was so rich that my boyfriend couldn't finish it. Our final course was dessert--bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream and hot buttered pecan sauce for him, apple tart with caramel and praline ice-cream for me. The praline ice-cream was great, but the bread pudding was too sweet in my opinion and the apple tart was virtually inedible on account of being too dry.- Service was also disappointing for a restaurant with this reputation. Our server was nice enough, but she would disappear for long blocks of time during inopportune moments when we really needed herAll in all, I'm glad I did a Reveillon dinner in NOLA, but I don't think I'll be recommending Luke to anyone.", "Date": "2013-01-02", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Joe T.", "ReviewID": "Snr8s3cVAedC1nLU7azUcw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first five star review.

When I walk through those revolving doors, I'm whisked back to my beloved Philadelphia. The European influence is evident on this menu, and I feel like Chef Besh captured the essence of what a cuisine does as it mutates over the years. He just skipped the 50 years it would take for his menu to evolve by being chef-smart and pulling it together. Others have complained about the beer and wine in odd glassware, but it somehow suits the restaurant. I feel like I should bring my grandfather here for lunch. Retired lawyers and doctors and high-powered business people would spend their morning here, reading papers and sipping a beer and chatting. L\u00fcke feels like the Galatoire's for a different class of people. I've eaten at L\u00fcke a couple ways: straight dinner, just apps, and a mixed meal. The very best decision I made was P&J oysters (a dozen for $13!), the poached yard-egg salad sans bacon (oddly filling), and a slice of Black Forest inspired cake (rich, creamy, heavy with Chantilly cream). The oysters here are always delish, and the price of the local oysters (P&J, for those not in the know) is really competitive for a restaurant in the CBD. If L\u00fcke is my magical fantasyland of a restaurant, why only three stars?Le sigh. Say it with me: the service. \u00a0The first time my lady and I came, our server looked like she was on speed or something. She was spacy and wired and jumpy without ever making eye contact. Of course we had a chat with the manager. I honestly thought it was a fluke because there were three other servers working the back room (where we sat) that were amazingly attentive and charming. Then I jump on Yelp and see that everyone else hates the service. But...but...but I love L\u00fcke! I don't want to hate L\u00fcke! This is my little oasis in all of New Orleans! Am I deluded? So I visit again. Similar experience. And the third visit is really what sealed my review. I came on a Sunday night after work. I sat at the bar with my Kindle. There were two bartenders, hopping around Doing Important Things\u2122. Between making drinks, gossiping with waiters, avoiding the managers, and running back to the kitchen, I sat for 20 minutes before anyone greeted me. Then the really surly bartender threw my menu at me as she walked past. That was surprising. The rest of my meal unfolded in similar, odd fashion with long periods of being ignored followed by rushed service. Having to defend my plate of oysters kept me amused which was good because I probably would have lost it and snapped at someone after the 4th attempt to remove them before I was finished AS I WAS SLURPING. It was like a game, only I would always be the loser. The food runners who brought my salad and my dessert didn't speak to me when they set the food down, but I don't think I can fault them on that. I was obviously reading. It was clear that I was busy so I think they were trying to respect that. That dinner took two hours; to say it borders on excessive for one person, seated at the bar, with no cooked food is an understatement. I think I'll keep coming to L\u00fcke, but my expectations have shifted. (I'm getting so much better at managing my disappointment.) L\u00fcke, if you ever shape up, I'll call you like that proverbial ex-boyfriend who promises to join the Army and get things together.

So we start our order for dinner with a few appetizers. Absinthe Frappe - Obsello and Peychaud's bitters over ice, wow that's a strong drink. It's got a licorice taste to it. I gonna stick with vodka from now on. On to the appetizers 1.) Raw oysters (P&J, Komomotos, and locals) delicious and fresh served on a tray of crushed ice. These morsels are sweet and meaty. And with a spicy cocktail sauce delicious. 2.) Mussels steamed were good but on the small size, not as meaty as I would of liked. 3.) Clams steamed in a nice sauce, but again on the small size, barely got the clam taste after one bite and done. 4.) Gumbo that had a rich and flavorful rue, oh that was GOOD... 5.) Assiette de charcuterie, for the less sophisticated a plate of pate, sliced sausage, and other delicious meats. A country bread crispy toasted, and sliced thin like a cracker. Wonderful flavors and textures to the pates. The hogs head cheese was spectacular. And the grainy mustard's and pickles, together on the bread just exploded in your mouth. 6.) Flamenkuche you ask? No this isn't a foul word its a pork belly pizza with sauteed onions and some damn delicious sauce. And it's served on a flat crispy pizza cracker. Oh my god this kicks ASS. Moving on to the salads we start to feel a bit full, but that won't stop us yet. Salad Luke was concocted of bibb lettuce, cucumbers, beets, and a buttermilk dressing. Very tasty and fresh. Roasted beet salad was just that delicious beets with toasted pistachios. I really enjoyed the crunch with the beets, nice offset.

or, the jumbo Louisiana shrimp \"en cocotte\" with McEwen and Sons cream white corn grits and Poche's andouille - was out of control. \u00a0The shrimp was perfectly cooked, and each piece was firm and juicy. \u00a0The sauce on top reminded me of the sauce in barbecue shrimp, very butter and dark with some deep heat. \u00a0The grits were creamy like a great risotto, with little savory bits of sausage infusing it with flavor. \u00a0I don't think shrimp and grits gets any better. \u00a0I took a few bites of the L\u00fcke burger, and it was pretty decent, if not deserving of national acclaim. \u00a0This came topped with tomatoes, Allan Benton's bacon, caramelized onions, and Emmenthaler cheese. \u00a0The meat was good, as were all the individual components, but the burger didn't make my mouth water. \u00a0Neither did the side of housemade fries, which was disappointing. \u00a0They looked so good in their tall cone, but they were sadly limp.For dessert we ordered Brendan's bread pudding, with vanilla bean ice cream and hot buttered pecan sauce, and the \"gateau basque,\" which was a vanilla cake with strawberries, simple syrup, and creole shrubb. \u00a0The bread pudding was good, but not the best in town. \u00a0I'd say the souffle at Commander's Palace and the bread pudding with whiskey sauce at Mr. B's were both better. \u00a0I liked the pecan sauce, but thought it would've been better with more pecan. \u00a0The \"gateau basque\" was the better dessert, very simple but with great flavor. \u00a0It had a really good crumb, too, like a cross between that of cake and cornbread, and the syrup moistened it up to great effect.Our dinner at L\u00fcke was a delightful experience, with warm service and some lip-smacking food - our waitress got a good tip and those shrimp and grits will be my standard for years to come. \u00a0If this restaurant were in my neighborhood I'd use it as a default for a nice but casual weekend dinner. \u00a0I also liked that the food was very New Orleans at heart, and I would recommend L\u00fcke to locals and tourists alike.", "Date": "2010-06-29", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Anna L.", "ReviewID": "_FZ9P6BU4zim-NT5s5l2mw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the old-school, modern yet vintage charm of this place, and the seafood-heavy menu!!

First of all, it's a John Besh restaurant, and I have grown to love his food in this city. I started off giving Luke four stars in my head, but knowing that I would be going back fairly regularly, I decided to hold off on the review and wait until I had more experiences to rate. I've been here at least 5 times, and I have 3 more weeks to add to that number. My favorite thing to do is go for their Happy Hour, which is a little known gem. Between the hours of 3p-6p daily, they have the best $.25 oysters. You just have to order them by 6pm, and you'll probably wait quite a while before they arrive on your table. It's worth the wait, because these are the best value you'll find in all of town. Share some oysters and the appetizers (rabbit and goose livers, the flamenkuche, foie gras terrine). As for the entrees, depending on your mood, I would recommend the cochon de lait or the croque monsieur if you want a sandwich or the shrimp grits if you want southern comfort food. One of the daily dinner specials is a pork dish over andoille cornbread stuffing. I don't know about the pork, but the cornbread can be ordered as a side (if it's the right day) and it's really, really good. The great thing about this place is how laid back and chill it is. The service is usually spot on too. Last tip, so you don't say I just repeated other reviews: My friends and I figured out how to make the sandwiches EVEN better. Ready? Take the pate and spread it in the cochon de lait. OMG it is sooo good. We told the waiter to recommend that to John Besh, but we're not sure if the message ever got there. If you're reading, Chef, try it!", "Date": "2010-04-08", "Author_Location": "Forest Hills, Queens, NY"}, {"Author": "Jordan S.", "ReviewID": "Gq67Vqna4EEz_jAFMyyLpw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's Johnnyyyyy!Seriously, the man is everywhere in the public eye these days, not just in New Orleans but nationally. Restaurant August is a religious experience for many, and while that's all well and good, I wanted to see if chef Besh's skill was matched by his range. Luke (no I'm not typing the superfluous umlaut) is often spoken of as the low brow foil to August, and a glance at the menu would seem to confirm that, provided you know your French well enough that \"en cocotte\" comes off as a fancy way of saying baked in a ramekin. The luxury inherently associated with anything French is then more of a charade than anything else. \u00a0Would the atmosphere therefore be as proletariat as the menu positioned itself to be?Unsurprisingly, yes and no. Walking in, I was stunned at just how brotastic it felt. Though not sportsbar loud, it was quite lively. Corporate types in the midst of their midlife crises slurped down freshly shucked oysters with abandon. Amicable chatter flowed down the length of the bar, while families with children either cowered in corners or screamed at their precious little houligans. Before I'm written off as either a stuffy old man or some sort of codger, I should point out that I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm not counting this sort of atmosphere as a detraction from the restaurant. It wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't entirely unpleasant for that. That's not to say this matched the ambiance of a typical New Orleans local hangout, and I don't believe that is how one would describe Luke. The gift and curse of being located in a hotel means an ever changing clientele. This largely explains the eclectic assortment of diners, and the clashing within those segments. Normally a loud atmosphere is associated with joviality, but at Luke, it was simply a function of various groups talking over each other.Having on good authority that the food was going to be excellent, I was ready to call this review Luke, the tragic hero of the philistines, that is, until we were finally seated. As our hostess whisked us past the bar, we came in sight of the true heart of Luke; its second dining room. With warm lighting, appropriately spaced tables, and an open view into the kitchen, it oozed elegant and self assured sensibility. But really, should you have expected anything different? After all, how cozy and unpretentious can a location on the 300 block of St. Charles really be? This ultimately confirmed my suspicions that Luke must have retained some trappings of its plush surroundings and the regal nature of its preceding restaurant. Having yet again experienced the dichotomy of the restaurant, on the one hand avowing accessibility while on the other maintaining illusions of French grandeur, I became even more curious about the food.Luckily, the food, in most ways, never disappointed. Besh truly is at his best infusing Creole classics with his Western European training. The food was comforting enough to feel familiar, but refined enough for one to discover unique touches and ingredients throughout the meal. My only complaint is a bit nitpicky. In a menu touting all of the house-made and house-cured meats available, I find it odd that the bacon is not given the same treatment, and is instead sourced from elsewhere. This is not to say that Allen Benton's bacon is bad; indeed, far from it. It just seems to be somewhat an admission of laziness on the part of the restaurant not to make their own.All in all, Luke makes a worthy attempt at championing itself as a place where anyone can go for unpretentious food and professional service. Closet foodies will appreciate the secretly (sometimes not so secretly) pretentious food, while everyone else will like the lack of affectation.The prix fixe is positively affordable, and the pricey cocktails are matched by a robust and inexpensive tap selection. For this, it deserves our praise, not anti Besh backlash. Why only four stars then?

My main course was the croque madame with pomme frites. \u00a0The croque family is like my second favorite variety of sammich after the monte christo (which is really just another version of the croque anyway), so I was excited. \u00a0My companion had the pressed sandwich of whole roast \"cochon de lait\", also with fries. \u00a0The sammiches were brought out on little wood cutting boards with very expensive cutlery (laguiole steak knives - $200 for a set of four at your better kitchenware stores) and the fries were thin cut and served in paper cones in metal wire stands like they do over there in that France country. \u00a0My croque was quite good and perfectly moist. \u00a0I've often had croques that are doused with b\u00e9chamel sauce to help cut the dryness acquired after a day behind a case. \u00a0Not here. \u00a0The fried egg on top was perfect, the yolk cooked to just the right degree of thickness. \u00a0My companion marveled over her cochon de lait, describing it as pork wrapped in more pork. \u00a0It was perfect - sweet, tender, and not too salty. \u00a0For dessert, we split the gateau basque, a vanilla cake with strawberries, a touch of simple syrup and creole shrubb (an orange liqueur), and a dollop of cream. \u00a0My companion, a notorious alcoholic, quaffed some sparkling wine with the cake to help rouse the flavor of the strawberries (I stuck with coffee - only ever ordered after a very satisfying meal). \u00a0The cake was just on the right side of being just right, if you can pick up what I'm laying down. \u00a0It was very dense, slightly moist, with an outstanding crust. \u00a0I would have increased the syrup and strawberries just a tad, but overall it was delicious. \u00a0 \u00a0I will eagerly eat here again when I return to New Orleans in the future. \u00a0For a city that's lousy with Creole/Cajun restaurants, L\u00fcke is a nice break and a real stand-out.", "Date": "2010-04-17", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Jinouchou T.", "ReviewID": "HlQr2t_Wd65zhz-fcsxjPg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best place for oysters in New Orleans!

I was looking to do the brisket special, but was told that was a bad choice, as per my waiter that, and a few other items were subpar. \u00a0He recommended the burger(made with ground beef and brisket), due to its national acclaim. \u00a0So I went with the burger, my wife the crab ravioli, homemade pasta. \u00a0Ugly turned Good: \u00a0I ordered \u00a0a absinthe suisse, (once again the waiter warned against, stating that it was quite bad, but i figured i would give it a go anyway)... should have listened. two words, Nas-Ty. \u00a0He asked how I liked it, I was polite, but honest, and he said no worries, we will get you something else, no extra charge. \u00a0next drink much better. \u00a0Well now comes the finale, I wish it were grand but it was a mixture of G,B & U. \u00a0We did not get our food for about an hour and 15 minutes, keep in mind i we ordered pasta and a burger, not quite a time consuming ordeal. \u00a0Was it worth the wait, yes!.... and no. \u00a0When our waiter checked on our food that was just brought out, he asked if the fries were warm enough, prompting that he knew they were most likely not. (now he didnt straight out say sorry about the wait, food was done for a while and sitting under the heaters, but his comment and the LUKE warm fries and burger, surely did.)I ordered my burger medium rare, but got medium, medium well. I would agree that it is one of the best burgers that I have eaten, and I am a burger fancier, but the interesting thing was my favorite part was the bacon, interestingly enough, when i commented on the bacons excellence to my waiter, he straight out told me that it was brought in, and not part of the pork they raise. \u00a0once again great honesty, great bacon, good job finding that amazing melt in your mouth flavor, but kinda funny since his main selling point was the interconnectedness with all the ingredients. \u00a0Ate a few fries, cold, so-so, let them be. \u00a0Now my wife's crab ravioli was pretty darn good, fresh, tasty, and a bit of spice, helping to tame down the sauciness. \u00a0perfect blend of yum. \u00a0the only thing that could have made this dish better would have been for it not to have mass quantities of crab shell in it. \u00a0I understand stuff happens, but would not expect to see it in a quality restaurant. Im not perfect, and i understand things like that happen, like i said I would have preferred it didnt and would have bumped up the star rating a notch had it not. but in one of the bites I had of my wifes plate, I had a shell the size of my fingernail. \u00a0Lame. \u00a0Had I swallowed that it probably would have hurt quite a bit going down.

Why you ask? This place has great food, great decor, and reasonable prices for a quality restaurant. However, it does lose a quarter of a star because I saw some less than spectacular service/performance going on. This place is split up into two sections, a back area and a front area. The front area has the bar and a few tables, the back area has the open kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook and where you can have bigger parties sit.I came here the first time for dinner; my friends were going to Restaurant August and I didn't have that kinda cash, so I settled for another of Besh's Restaurants, which is how I ended up here. At $22 plus or minus a plate, I would not call this place cheap, but it is a discount compared to the alternative. I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp En Coccotte. It was 5 or 6 shrimps served on top of creamy grits in a cast iron skillet. The flavors were absolutely amazing, very savory and complimented the grits. I also tried the creme brulee and the Galette aux fraise t for dessert, both were very tasty. The creme brulee had fresh fruit and was excellently done. The Galette was like a strawberry danish with a scoop of ice cream. Good but not amazing. Before we left, one of the busboys, who kinda reminds me of Kenneth from 30 rock, recommended that we try the pancakes for brunch. He told us they were delicious, but could not tell us why. We took his advice anyways and came back for brunch. We ordered a stack of Mimi's pancakes (comes with 6 pancakes) and a side of home fries. The pancakes were some of the best I have ever had, unfortunately I cannot explain why. They are just good. The home fries came with onions and Allan Benton's bacon. This was the first time I had ever had Benton's bacon, and it was just soo good that I had to order some to go. Both times I came here, the food was absolutely delicious.The only down side to my experience was a couple of servers. Our server was Chris, and he seemed like he just did not care very much. He did the bare minimum to be our server including checking in on us, and refilling drinks. When asked about the shrimps, he just said they were good (which to his credit they were), but he did not describe them in any sense. You would think a waiter would know what they are serving. I also saw another server eating a handful of fries, from his hand, while working, and in sight of the customers. That just seems like something that would be frowned upon wherever you go. And that is where the half a star went.

We were visiting Nola for the holidays, and got a recommendation for Luke from our concierge. This is the unfortunate story of our dinner there.First, we had reservations, and were seated promptly. Our server took a few minutes to get to us, but ok - they were full. No problem. We ordered drinks, then he ducked away as we were going to ask questions about the menu. Ok, again, it was busy. The drinks arrived promptly, and we got water, and were able to ask a few questions about the menu, which is honestly pretty poorly explained. For example, the menu lists an item called \"shrimp en cocotte\" - we asked what that meant, and he didn't answer - just repeated what the menu said. We ordered said shrimp dish, and I ordered the \"entrecote\" (ribeye), and a bowl of soup. The soup came immediately, Matzo ball chicken, and it was great - \u00a0peppery, not too salty, nice texture to the Matzo ball. So far, so good.At this point, looking around, I realized that our server had all the tables in the front two thirds of the place. He was running his butt off, admittedly, but virtually no one else was helping him out. There were a couple of \u00a0food runners, but they were only coming out of the kitchen to bring food to tables - nothing else.So then our entrees arrive. My steak looked delicious, but there were no fries. And clearly, the dish is \"entrecote and frites\" on the menu. The food runner disappeared so fast, though, that he didn't hear me calling after him. I also had only the butter knife, and try though I might, it didn't get through the steak well. My guy started in on his shrimp right away, and it was great. Shrimp were tender, perfectly cooked, and the grits were phenomenal. It was literally three or four minutes before ANY server, of any variety, passed anywhere near our table, and I could ask for fries and a steak knife. I did get both, at last, and the fries were tasty, but not freshly cooked. For a $25 entree, you have got to be kidding me. The steak was very flavorful, though, and prepared medium rare as requested.And this is when it got bad. I can forgive errors in the kitchen, or a food runner bringing out the wrong thing. But we sat for over 20 minutes after we had finished our dishes, napkins on the plates, empty water glasses too, without seeing our server. Or actually, we saw him plenty. He was hustling, even took the orders of tables right next to us, and pointedly avoided looking at our table so he wouldn't have to deal with our empty dishes and need for further service. All the time waiting, with nothing to eat or drink, gave me the opportunity to look around. At some point, I noticed that the tables in the front third of the restaurant had bread rolls and butter, but NONE of the tables in the second third (where we were seated) did. Odd. Maybe bread rolls are only provided to half of the patrons. I never figured it out, but literally the whole time we were there, all five tables that I could see in our section didn't get bread. But I saw it being taken to the front tables. Finally, finally, the guy came over and apologized for neglecting us, and actually said he had been stuck with a table. Only, he hadn't, because I had been watching him for the past 15 minutes. Yes, our server was moving, but the place was ridiculously understaffed. Except for the three, yes THREE, hosts who they had on duty. What restaurant needs three hosts? It was so frustrating to see them literally standing around doing nothing while things were not getting done in the restaurant. Anyway, no matter how good the food is, terrible service ruins a meal. I really had been looking forward to dessert, but there was no way I was giving them more of my money, or spending more time there. This place is so horribly mismanaged that no one should waste there money there, even if the chef is a James Beard award winner. He clearly has nothing to do with this place anymore. And yes, we still tipped over 15%. We just can't ever short-change someone in the service industry. But this place does not deserve your money.

I always order the raw oysters, but you can get them cooked anyway you want for 50 cents each between 3 and 6 pm. The first time I ordered the slippery mollusks, they were small and not well shucked; before the second round we ordered, a veteran shucker luckily came in to take care of business. They were still small but a good shucking makes a big difference. It should be noted that it wasn't quite oyster season that time around. The grilled oysters are very good as well. They're a little like Drago's but without the deluge of butter and cheese.I also partake in half-off libations for beer, wine, and well liquor.

My boyfriend ordered the eggs in a jar \u00a0which was described being served with fried shrimp, cheddar grits, jalape\u00f1os, and a poached egg. He was turned off by the word \"fried\" since he didn't want a heavy breaded fried shrimp but reluctantly ordered it. I ordered the crab omelet with asparagus with a side order of Mimi's pancakes. I was happy I asked about getting a side order of pancakes since it saved $4 off the bill and you get 3 pancaked instead of 5, which is plenty. The wait seemed like a long time considering the restaurant was not busy at all but you almost have to expect this for a nicer restaurant. After all, you are the for the experience along with the food, right? It would have been nice though to have the waiter ask if we wanted another drink or to give us an update on our order. But, 20 minutes later the food arrived. We got the shrimp and grits along with the pancakes. My boyfriend LOVED his. Perfect balance of cheese and grits, not too spicy at all, and the shrimp seemed more saut\u00e9ed than actually fried. Delightful surprise. Shrimp we're perfectly cooked and with such good flavor. I was regretting not ordering it myself but was looking forward to the omelet. Oh yeah, where was it? I only got the pancakes so far. I ate one pancake and it was okay. I mean you can't really screw up a pancake, right? The pecan butter on top was a nice change to the standard version we get in western New York though so I wasn't unhappy. Since they seated us at a small table and there was not a lot of room, I decided to have the waiter take away the pancake plate to make room for the omelet and I didn't want to overeat. After that, the waiter must have realized I didn't get my omelet yet so he quickly hurried off to the kitchen to check on it after he blamed someone else for the mistake. He brought it back finally and when I tried it, I was unhappy to taste a sweet flavor, which I later found out was mascarpone cheese. It was also barely warm. Not good overall. Plus they serve it with a side salad which, frankly, I think is bizarre. I mean, no toast? I saw they had multigrain toast on the menu though so I though I would get a quick order in so I flagged down the waiter to get some. I had maybe 2 bites of the omelet and just couldn't eat anymore so my human garbage disposal BF ate it. Thankful to not entirely waste $16, I eagerly awaited the toast. And waited. And waited. And waited. The waiter finally returned, sans the toast, and asked if the was anything else he could get us and I tried to politely remind him about the toast. Well, he apologized after he again tried to blame someone else, than ran off to the kitchen to get some. Well, the toast was burned on one side and untasted on the other. How the heck can you screw up toast? It wasn't warm and the jam it was served with was a blueberry and strawberry blend. No butter? At this point, I was pissed and we had to hurry up to check out of the hotel and catch a cab to the airport. It would have been nice if the waiter asked how our meal was. At least he didn't charge me for the toast. I would try Luke again but not for breakfast. After $75 and it being my last meal in New Orleans, I was not a happy girl.

First off, we sauntered in about 10pm on a Saturday night (sans reso), and they entertained the idea of seating us anyway. We had to wait a bit, but the bar was perfect for grabbing a coupla of pints prior to dinner. I rarely eat oysters, but the man next to us at the bar had the most humongous and delicious-looking plate of oysters I have ever seen. I'm talking mutant-ninja looking oysters. Incredible. Eventually we were sat at our table and quickly made our way through the unique drink list. The drinks were strong, and really good. The crawfish bisque was delectable, as was the pressed sandwich of \"cochon de lait.\" \u00a0I ate and drank myself stupid in this restaurant, and I can't wait to go back and do it again.", "Date": "2010-04-21", "Author_Location": "Pleasanton, CA"}, {"Author": "Jen J.", "ReviewID": "soI1qxrija8dc55Db2CInA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On our trip to NOLA, my husband & I used Yelp to help us pick places for dinner. (John Besh is apparently some sort of restaurant god in NOLA.) We were seated in the rear of the first floor of the restaurant (another seating room up a few stairs in the back). The restaurant appears to share restrooms w/ the lobby of the Hilton Hotel--from the previous reviews, I had no idea that it was connected to a hotel.Oddly, the hostess sat us at a two top right next to another two top instead of at a 3rd two top farthest away from the other seated couple. It became even odder when we realized that the couple was involved in the most private & devastating conversation that they will probably ever have. When we arrived, they were at the point where the wife was asking the husband where he had been meeting the woman w/ whom he was having an affair--at their home, a hotel or somewhere else. She then asked whether the other woman was going to get a divorce & if that was her husband's plan as well. Why he hadn't left her & their 3 kids last year & when he had become such a good liar. Smartly, the husband kept his answers polite & vague. He didn't have a plan, he didn't know why he hadn't broken up w/ his wife, he wasn't sure how long it would take them to figure out if they were getting a divorce or not. \u00a0Needless to say, my husband & I were shocked when we realized what was going on two feet from us. To our further horror, the waiter kept reminding them that there was no rush! I wanted to yell, \"Do you know WTF they are talking about? \u00a0Don't you want them to leave?\" I guess all the experts say you should have this kind of conversation in a public place because it encourages some restraint from yelling & getting violent, but don't tell that to my husband & I when we're just trying to have a good meal on vacation. They eventually left & were replaced by a gay couple who ended up asking to switch seats because it was too cold at that table. Cold is right. Cold from the cheating vibes lingering. \u00a0We managed to order drinks (beer & nice, but small, Chardonnay) & put in for appetizers. I thoroughly enjoyed the Luke Salad despite the odd platting--the whole leaves of Bibb lettuce were lightly dressed w/ the Buttermilk dressing, but the cubes of cucumber tossed in dill w/ carrot slivers & pieces of pickled beets were served underneath the lettuce. I could see the beets peering out, but I almost forgot about the other accoutrements. I know that Bibb lettuce is fragile, but I would have preferred the salad tossed or topped w/ the other bits or if the plate was larger so everything could be visible. In any case, it was a tasty salad. My husband had a cup of the crab bisque, which was too crabby for me. He enjoyed it, though to be a bisque, it should have been a touch thicker or creamier. \u00a0For entrees, my husband had the crab ravioli which he liked. I had the \"cassoulet\" w/ duck confit & pork sausage. Since it's cassoulet, I imagined the pork would be stewed in w/ the white beans & vegetables & there might be small piece of duck confit. Well, boy was I wrong. It came out in a 9\"cast iron dish mouth-searing hot. The duck was not small, but a WHOLE LEG; the sausage was not stewed in, but a whole German-style long BRAT laying on the side of the dish. To finish it off, there was PORK BELLY about 1\"2 on top. It smelled delicious & I smartly enjoyed the aroma while it cooled down. When I stuck my fork in, I found a scarcity of white beans & mostly breadcrumbs cooked, get this, in small pieces of PORK FAT. To recap:\"cassoulet\"=2 large pieces of fatty meat+1 small piece of fatty meat+bread crumbs+a few white beans+more meat fat. My husband found this kind of amusing since I am an advocate of eating meat fat since it's super tasty (Bourdain=proud of me), but this has got to have been the most decadent, over the top, ridiculous cassoulet ever served (Bourdain would not have approved). \u00a0I tasted a bit of each component before I called it quits. The server, to his credit, asked me twice if it was not to my liking to which I honestly responded, it's just \"so rich.\" I'm just not the type to send things back & make a fuss, but the dish should have been a 1/5 of the size & an appetizer NOT called \"cassoulet.\" It's not that the description on the menu was completely inaccurate, I guess...personally, I think the server should have warned me. It's too bad my husband wasn't feeling well & that we don't love oysters (since they have a raw bar) because I think we would have tried to salvage my meal w/ dessert or seafood or cheese/spread plate. \u00a0 The menu at Luke is not all over the top like this though we heard the server explain that there is an off the menu vegetarian plate because literally there were NO veggie entrees on the menu which is to be expected at a French/German restaurant, but still. Somehow I think a place that bills itself to be pretty nice could do a more authentic cassoulet & have a French/German/NOLA inspired veggie dish.", "Date": "2010-12-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Drinky C.", "ReviewID": "GHQz-DL_LZLl7tvDhb0QIw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice French brasserie, with a nice take on seafood. \u00a0The 3 of us enjoyed 2 dozen oysters, P & J's and some Atlantic variety I can't recall. \u00a0The cold app assiete was awesome, especially the pate and the headcheese. \u00a0I went with the redfish with crab meat on the waiter's recommendation. \u00a0It was a bit disappointing...everything just tasted like butter and lemon. \u00a0One friend had the shrimp and grits, and it was definitely the highlight. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0My other friend had the entrec\u00f4te grill\u00e9e au frites. \u00a0Tasty, but nothing special, although the fries were just as good as everyone else has said. \u00a0Finished off with a dessert whose name I can't recall, but was kind of a beignet-bananas-foster dish.", "Date": "2008-11-03", "Author_Location": "Kansas City, MO"}, {"Author": "Harry K.", "ReviewID": "CxQMHet2HYsrUtolqNVcMg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had the pleasure of revisiting New Orleans shortly after my roadtrip.

Luke's located in the Hilton on St Charles, across the street from the Intercontinental and a block or two from Poydras. And as usual in the New Orleans CBD - parking is a bitch, or expensive. but nevermind that -Luke is one of John Besh's restaurants - he seems to be taking over the restaurant scene nowdays - think a casual French bistro complete with newspaper racks, wood tables, knives and forks wrapped in kitchen linen - the windows also bring in a good amount of sunlight so coming in to eat lunch here it becomes a bright spot. However the way the restaurant is with the front and there's a back open entrance to the lobby/kitchen/whatever if you sit in the back tables you can catch a nasty draft. I'm a big fan of the wild boar and also the rabbit pate - they come in these jars and crostinis - however once in a while I'll get one that feels like it has been in a refrigerator on the highest cold setting and it gets kind of a real hard consistency - but for the most part - creaminess. They also have a charcuterie plate, soups such as gumbo, a matzo ball soup (which is pretty much vegetable stock and a dumpling). For lunch they also offer specials - I think it's a cup of soup and an entree for about 20 bucks - they serve up different choices each day.I got the Luke burger - which is just a great burger. I feel kind of dumb getting it a lot but sometimes nothing beats a well cooked burger for lunch. My friend got the mussels which come in this huge cast iron pot (cheap - 17 bucks i think?) - I also tried the shrimp and grits, which is kind of a smothered in this rosemary sauce - extremely rich. There's also the shrimp farci which I think is one of their best dishes - shrimp stuffed with crabmeat over this extremely rich blood orange hollandaise. They also have a pretty big raw bar - with crab legs, fresh oysters, etc.So food is on point.Service however - every time I came in here the servers seemed kind of aloof - one in particular I had on my recent trip - she had extremely bad breath (I think every server should be carrying a pack of mints if they're working all day) and neglected to tell my friend that they charge for every refill on soda - my friends drank about 3 diet cokes each - so they were charged 18 bucks for refills. Now in New Orleans, people love their Coca colas so it's kind of odd to see a restaurant such as Luke to not have free refills - however I feel like the server should have said something about that. Service is on point with the time and food - but the apathetic moods kind of turns me off a little. At least fake a smile. I frequent this spot for lunch - Luke is open early for breakfast and is open late (I think 11 pm?) However with better options for dinner I'll just keep Luke as a lunch spot.", "Date": "2009-07-11", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Nicole W.", "ReviewID": "6ssM5hkAMY8t2UgD2hqH-Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my overall favorite dinner in New Orleans.

My friend got the smoked pork shank, Mangalitsa belly & bratwurst, with house-made sauerkraut ($23). \u00a0Both of our mouths dropped when this got delivered. \u00a0If you've ever been to Germany, this plate was exactly what you get in every bar. \u00a0A GIANT pork shank, with tons of other pork products. \u00a0It was so big she didn't even know how to start tackling eating it. \u00a0The sauerkraut was very interesting. \u00a0it was really quite sweet, but both of us liked it. \u00a0It was just different than normal sauerkraut. \u00a0The pork shank was perfectly smoked and had great flavor and tenderness. \u00a0The sausage was also delicious, and of course pork belly is always good. \u00a0Talk about a rich dish though. \u00a0My goodness! \u00a0And talk about seriously large portions...she didnt' even come close to finishing the meal. \u00a0I think a table of 3 could've shared this as one entree and been fine. \u00a0For reals. \u00a0it was big. We were so full we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. \u00a0We had also been there for so long we were tired and wanted to go home. \u00a0I think it was over 2 hours for dinner, which is totally fine when you're in that mood, but neither of us really were. \u00a0The timing was very off, but if you're there on a not busy night, I bet you'd love it! \u00a0I also thought the pricing was very good for what you get. \u00a0The wines by the glass options were extensive too, and they do them all by the glass or 1/4 or 1/2 carafe. \u00a0That was a nice touch.", "Date": "2012-01-19", "Author_Location": "Studio City, CA"}, {"Author": "Karl S.", "ReviewID": "PZwRaS-sHQubSAgBezwTUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Start with a cup of the Seafood Gumbo a la Creole--the perfect blend of seafood, sausage, rice, and seasonings.

It seemed strange to me, as people on the streets were raging outside, why this restaurant was as deserted as it was. I soon found out the reason.THE FOOD was definitely not my cup of tea. We were feeling adventurous and ordered the P\u00e2t\u00e9 of Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers and Pied de cochon\"croustillant\" off the Charcuterie section. NOT WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING. Apart from the fact that we did not speak French and had NO idea what we were ordering, the waiter made no attempt to help us despite our questioning gazes. When they arrived, the croustillant turned out to be two small pieces of deep-fried undistinguishable meat (or pig's feet meat, not that we could tell). We couldn't see where the Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers were, but on the other plate was a jar full of questionable jam. We soon found out the \"jam\" was actually the \"p\u00e2t\u00e9\" of the livers. Ech.THE SERVICE was pretty absent (or should I say absentminded?). When we first entered the restaurant, the host was talking on the phone with her friend/SO, and even though we stood right in front of her, she kept on giggling to the person on the other end of the phone. It wasn't until a man with a managerial vibe stood behind her that she hung up the phone and showed us to our seats. Our waiter clearly was not really paying attention. He told us he would bring us water with lemons and straws, and it took him 30 minutes to bring just the water, without the lemons and straws (but I guess I must be too picky). When it was time to ring up the check, he brought us a check totaling $100. Um excuse me? No way two deep-fried balls and a jar of pate could cost $100. We had to wait for him to come around to ask him if it was the right check. So in total: Time we spent waiting for service = 1-2 hoursTime we spent eating = 10 minutesGet the picture?THE ATMOSPHERE was pretty good. Dim lighting gave off a romantic kind of feel.

We all started with cocktails, which were pretty fantastic. I'm a big fan of the French 75. The server disappeared for a long time before we could order... any questions we had about the menu we had to look up on someone's iphone since he was not available to answer questions about terms we were unfamiliar with. We began the meal with salads... I had the yard egg salad, which was pretty fantastic! My favorite part of the meal, by far. The way the egg explodes onto the greens with the crunch of crispy pig's ear... just amazing. The person who brought our salads was not our server and was very confused about who had ordered which salad, there seems to be a pretty serious lack of communication at Luke.Everyone enjoyed a different entree, and after a considerable wait, which is somewhat understandable considering how busy they were, they finally arrived. My mom had the mussels, which was stuffed to the brim, good quantity, although the flavor was fairly bland. It also came with fries which were COLD. My mom did send them back and after a bit of a wait, got a fresh batch. I had the duck confit, which I think was one of the best entrees, although it did come with some kind of fatty pork product that I passed off to my boyfriend which he happily ate. My boyfriend had the crispy pork belly and clams pasta, which was just fairly bland overall. Everyone else was pretty underwhelmed with the experience.At some point through the entree some of the people ordered another round of drinks... they were out of some of the beers on the menu, and the server never brought a glass of wine that was ordered, however he didn't charge us for it either so it wasn't \u00a0that big of a deal.For dessert, my boyfriend had the bread pudding that was fairly dry and did not come with enough sauce or ice cream to make up for the dryness.

Great happy hour, especially since I work next door. (3-6pm daily, half price for most drinks, 50c oysters). I love their French 75, and the rest of their cocktails are pretty decent too. However, the oysters at happy hour are usually small and they recently raised the price to 50cents per oysters.Lunch? Oh my goodness. If you have two hours for lunch, feel free to stop by, but if you're like any normal person, you probably don't have that kind of time. Service is incredibly slow at lunch, almost to the point of being inexcusable.Food? Eh. I've never had anything bad, that's for sure. The burger, BLT (it's made with softshell crab!), mussels are all very good dishes, but nothing has ever come close to being amazing.Overall, I would say Luke is a mediocre restaurant that has decent food.

THE CHICKEN WAS COOL INSIDE AGAIN! \u00a0I could not believe it and my friend decided to go ahead and eat it anyway since it was getting late, he was hungry, and I was already halfway through my dinner. \u00a0After alerting our server of the second mishap, they rightfully took this dish off our bill and did not charge us for dessert. \u00a0This was an appropriate response on their part, however it was not sufficient to give me faith that the execution of this dish will be better in the future. \u00a0I was shocked that a John Besh restaurant would have such an issue.DESSERTI had the Apple Gallette with ice cream. \u00a0The apples were tasty, well-cooked, and well-seasoned. \u00a0The ice cream (pecan, I think?) was very good and paired well with the Gallette. \u00a0The pastry itself was a bit disappointing. \u00a0Parts of it were the flaky pastry it ought to be, but the outer parts were chewy and tough. \u00a0Overall it did not taste that fresh and I suspect that some corners were cut with this dish. \u00a0I would not order this again or recommend it to anyone else.My friend had the bread pudding and enjoyed it. \u00a0It came smothered with sauce and ice cream, so I don't think I would have enjoyed it (I'm a bit of a bread pudding purist).SUMMARYDon't order the chicken! \u00a0The cocktails we tried were great and the service was pretty good, but a little more formal than I expected for a bistro. \u00a0The portions are generous. \u00a0Good, not great, food. \u00a0I'd go back, but have to deduct a star for the chicken.", "Date": "2013-02-07", "Author_Location": "Baltimore, MD"}, {"Author": "amber leilani m.", "ReviewID": "UrfORSjygU_fP6Zmrq7_Gw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am giving LUKE 5 stars soley based on the LUKE BURGER. i do not need to eat anything else here. perfection! and it's as big as my head. perfect to split. \u00a0i recomend a good cabernet to go with it \u00a0and you've got a pretty tasty date night!", "Date": "2010-09-13", "Author_Location": "New Orleans, LA"}, {"Author": "Andy P.", "ReviewID": "ZonY9rsv6wDKYy6nYUp7Ig", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Today's lunch was the reason I started yelping!

We were greeted by a hostess who looked at us as though we had just killed her cat, and our waiter seemed like he had a thousand things he'd rather be doing than waiting tables. They weren't particularly busy, but our waiter seemed occupied with doing anything but his job. I don't always like my job either, but after the third time I'd asked for a water refill and was absolutely parched, I had to wonder what he was up to when he kept vanishing. Despite the terrible service, my food was delicious. The Bloody Marys had just enough kick. I ordered the fried oyster, bacon and avocado salad to start, and the oysters were perfection (although the dressing was a bit heavy). My entree was the Croque Madame, and the crispy edges were heavenly. The middle got a bit soggy with all the cheese and a little much mustard, but overall I was happy. One of my dining companions had the Crawfish Bisque, which was one of the worst things I've ever eaten. Imagine a cup of heavy cream mixed with pepper. No crawfish flavor, terrible seasoning and entirely too heavy. Nothing like what my grandmother used to make. The same dining companion had a particularly unfortunate meal, as she ordered the crab omelet. All I can say here is that cucumber, crab and eggs do not belong on the same fork. The third diner in our party had some better luck with the seafood gumbo (good, not amazing), a nice crab salad and some sort of onion bacon tart thing that was divine in small portions, but a bit heavy overall. Fries were served cold. Not lukewarm, cold. I thought it might be an off day and was ready to forgive the bad service until a bartender popped open a bottle of champagne and the cork grazed my head (I was sitting about 20 feet from the bartender in question), and no one seemed to care. Our waiter resurfaced at the end of the meal to ask how things were, we told him we were finished, and no less than 20 minutes later he returned to again ask how we were doing. Check please? He wandered off not to be seen again for 10 minutes, and we entertained ourselves watching the hostess wander from her post then sprint back across the restaurant every time the phone rang. Professional. Really. Add some bizarre, disjointed decor and the overall atmosphere almost ruined my food. I've eaten at a few other Besh restaurants and have never been disappointed until now.

We could literally see the salt on a few of them. \u00a0Anyway, Sean and Jamal kept us laughing and smiling (Miami Dolphins!), which we appreciated, but we both found Lukes to be highly overrated. Perhaps we've been spoiled by the seafood readily available here in California at reasonable prices. For instance, at Fisherman's Wharf you can get a whole dungeness or local crab plucked right from the ocean and steamed up for you for a mere $8 bucks. And having said that, I'm now wondering if I'd fallen for a tourist trap by going to Lukes.

I can appreciate rich food, as a New Orleanian, but found Luke to be deplorable. Excess grease aside, the food suffered from a lack of cohesion within the plates. I began with the crawfish bisque, which came out as a cracked roux with large grease slicks throughout. Curiously there was a stuffed crawfish shell in the soup, but no seafood fork or finger bowl was provided as means to make possible the consumption of that morsel. As my main course I ate the jumbo Gulf shrimp and grits, and while I found the grits very enjoyable, the only flavors on the plate were spice, spice and more spice, which totally obliterated any chance that the Gulf shrimp's subtle flavors might shine. Fortunately for me, the dessert that followed was certainly a high point in my week. I ordered the Banana Cream Profiteroles, and was truly impressed by the rich flavor of the banana cream, contrasted with the concentrated flavor of the Foster's sauce, it was all very lovely. The service was mediocre, but the waitress was dingy but attentive. The concept is absolutely silly: they use dish towels for napkins, paper table cloths, random kitchen tools as plate stand-ins, and unappetizing methods and procedures for consumption of certain morsels of shelled stuffing. \u00a0Do not go there under any circumstances.", "Date": "2008-07-27", "Author_Location": "Metairie, LA"}, {"Author": "Suzanne K.", "ReviewID": "v9QsceVvXA2wGWkGanwsEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "True to rave reviews here, lunch at Luke was a standout of my visit to the Big Easy. My friend and I split the burger (rated one of the 10 best in the country) and the pulled pork sandwich. Both came with shoestring potatoes and everything was out-of-this-world delicious! The service was friendly and genuine. Our waiter was helpful and spot on with his suggestions. The surprise of the meal was the fantastic cup of coffee. Beans are ground as each portion is made with a french press, and the taste is amazing - rich without being bitter and a super smooth finish. I asked the waiter about it and learned that they serve something called Santa Lucia Estate coffee from a Nicaraguan company that is partly owned by the family of one of Luke's owners. Couldn't wait to get on-line and order some of the Vienna Roast for use at home and gift giving this holiday season.
