The food was OK, but so overpriced for the quality and portion of food that it really put a damper on how I felt about it. I mean, $17.5 for a plain hamburger and charging extra for toppings? C'mon, people. It's not even grassfed and/or organic (or if it is, they don't mention it on the menu). I tried my dinner companion's meals, as well, and they were again, fine but nothing near what I would expect given the price points. The live music is great if there are good musicians playing. One of the times I was there, we were treated to some very loud experimental jazz from some Berkelee students - I could barely hear the person sitting next to me.The cocktails are strong, good, and creative, and about averaged priced for a fancy cocktail.

The Short Ribs Benedict was nothing short of perfect. I like my eggs poached easy with no runny whites. I also don't like my benny drowned under heavy hollandaise. I like a balanced dish with a moist, chewy and not soggy muffin that can stand on its own under the egg, sauce and short rib/salmon/what have you. The Beehive's benny nailed it. The eggs were perfect and there was just enough hollandaise to flavor the dish. The shredded short ribs were tender and hearty but didn't distract from the yolky eggs and creamy hollandaise. The fries were 1/4 inch shavings of potato, which made for excellent crispy and slightly fluffy fries. My date had the Poutine and he cleared his plate, so that needs no explanation.Amazing service as well. I dropped my knife on the floor and within seconds, a man came over and gave me a new one.

The scallops were cooked perfectly but I thought the broth was a bit salty. Added a side order of Fiddleheads & Corn with Sriracha Butter. I had to ask our waitress what fiddleheads were (young fern, harvested for use as a vegetable, has a spiral shape to it). She advised it was going to have a bitter aftertaste but the corn and sriracha butter would balance it out. Gave it a go and definitely glad I tried it. The corn was perfect and so sweet.

My boyfriend and I came here on Friday night and although it was packed, we were able to find two spots at the end of the bar downstairs. Tip: Both bars offer the full dining menu.We ordered the short ribs grilled cheese and the cheeseburger, two of the more affordable offerings on the menu. The short ribs are tender and sandwiched between two large, hearty, fluffy slices of Texas toast. The cheeseburger was decent too but the star of the show were the hand cut fries--rather than cut thick into large wedges or cut so thin that they're basically potato chips, here they're cut into strips that are the perfect thinness so that they're still fries (not chips) but wider and flatter so that there's more surface area for crisping and seasoning. I highly recommend trying their fries--I don't normally like potatoes enough to eat them but I was so hooked on these fries!So take decent food and fantastic fries, throw in an hour of sitting and waiting for our food and an apology from the manager regarding the delay, mix in a menu that's on the pricier side and some eclectic decor with live music in the background and I'd say you get yourself about 3 stars.", "Date": "2014-04-12", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Anne F.", "ReviewID": "1hB2ZyDEBRSwmiJ0JwbX3g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Delicious drinks, live music (decent), and passable food.

Next time I might request a seat downstairs on my open table reservation. The menu is good, though somewhat limited. If you're interested in a wide variety of choices this may not be your go too. The food itself is very good, though slightly overpriced, but I guess part of it goes to the venue and musicians costs. Both times we have started with the pierogi appetizer. It's very good albeit they look like wontons more than pierogi. The first time I was there I tried the poutine which is good, but won't exactly bring you flashbacks on Montreal. This time I went with the burger and added Gorgonzola on top. It was cooked pretty good, and was tasty. My Wife went with the eggplant omelette. It was good but there was only one large piece of eggplant. Both came with some fries and veggies. Our friend went with the quiche and it looked great and was a big portion. The coffee is actually very good with free refills. There's also an interesting drink menu, but again it's pricey.

Warning - MAKE RESERVATIONS AHEAD OF TIME!The parsley soup is deceivingly addictive. When you hear \"parsley\" you don't usually think, \"Oh I've gotto try some of that,\" and yet I would come back here just for their parsley soup. So creamy, such complex flavors ,and the croutons they add really give it a boost of flavor and crunch. I ordered the Eggs Shakshuka which was incredibly delicious and surprisingly spicy. This is a very authentic, high-spice level dish (make sure to add the Moroccan sausage). The poached egg really helps to cool down the spicy tomato sauce, and the creamy polenta really compliments this dish well. The star - THICK CUT FRENCH TOAST!!! Do not leave Boston, MA without going to The Beehive and trying their thick cut french toast. If you are reading this, I assure you this will be a life changer. My wife ordered this dish, and I had one of those experiences where I was enjoying my meal until I tried hers...then, immediately my jealousy took over as I tried to sell her my polenta for more of her french toast. I didn't make a poor decision because the Shakshuka is really good, but the French Toast is unbeatable.

Yes, we're young, but not inexperienced eaters or poor tippers.We arrived 10 minute early for our reservation and were told to get a drink at the bar and we'd be seated right away. Instead we stood off the the side and weren't seated until 9:10 at a table that'd be open since we walked in. Added that it was next to the service station, we feared the night going down hill quickly and bad omen it turned out. (As turns out they'd texted me twice to tell us our table was ready \"on time\", but I'd left my phone at the hotel so we didn't get it. Apparently standing in the direct sight line of the SIX hosts still warranted two texts instead of one of them ending their gossip hour to walk 10 feet to us and another 35 to our table.) Our waiter didn't introduce himself, nor check in throughout the meal. So, Bill (as the receipt said) as no idea the cassoulet was underseasoned and that my entre seemed confused -- a great piece of duck but served w/ spicy fried rice and tart pickles?

They were sliced so thin that there is no way we had more than half a beet in the entire salad, plus they were stuck to the plate which made it hard to eat.

Made a reservation early in the week for Sunday morning, but 11:30 wasn't available so we had to get 11:00. They called about the reservation two or three times and sent a couple threatening emails that required responses in order to hold the reservation. What the hell? One person called ahead to try to get the restaurant to present some homemade cupcakes to a birthday diner. She was put on a long hold and told that the \"cupcake policy\" (those two words should never touch) was $5 per cupcake plating fee. In addition to the 1.5-to-2-hour time limit on the table, there is the threat to charge $25 per person for no-show reservations (more than about three minutes late constitutes a no show, even if all but one of the members of your party is present). There were other rules about the size of the meal you have to order to sit at a table, a cake policy, and probably several other policies as well. I did not review them in full, but you might want to.We're not off to the best start, Beehive. But hey, the menu looks good and I'm always up for drinking before noon, \u00a0so many a Bloody will balm my increasingly belligerent attitude toward being treated like a piece of crap before I even sit down for what is going to end up being a $50 meal.So we get there on time but not without some anxiety. We were seated downstairs instantly. The place is indeed very cool, very bohemian, very New York. There's a jazz band playing downstairs, gently, and some round tables in front of it. They placed us at a table in the rear corner, near an emergency exit door. I feared it would be cold there, but it was not. The birthday diner also had his half-consumed starbucks coffee snatched from his hands -- no outside food or drink permitted, per Beehive Coffee Policy.Imagine this for a server: slick punk-rock haircut, smallish plugs in her earlobes, and a wiseass response to almost every question. She was skilled and attentive and largely non-intrusive, but when I asked for a recommendation I was told that she doesn't eat there, and that if I want something sweet, to order the French Toast. Overall the service was quite good, and I know plenty of people who wouldn't have minded her attitude.The food came out promptly, but I noticed that all of the eggs at the table were overcooked. All four poached eggs were hard and non-runny. My omelette was tasty, but the eggs were dry and overcooked and looked like they came out of a paper carton of Egg Product. The ingredients inside were good but unevenly distributed throughout. The fries however were exceptionally delicious: thin slices of potato, I'm not sure how they cooked them, but they were savory and creamy and fantastic.I don't think I'll be back any time soon though. I'd rather go somewhere mellow with no rules, somewhere I can linger and drink if I want to, somewhere they will make my eggs runny, and where the server doesn't give me any attitude. Beehive is surely a great place to be seen, but you can be sure that with that many rules, nobody you see will be having too much fun. It just isn't allowed.(Oh yeah, and they messed up the bill - someone was charged $70 when she was supposed to be charged about $25. If you are going to grab a medium starbucks out of a diner's hands, you damn well better get the bill right.

There are a million other venues/restaurants that, on paper, sound just like The Beehive. In practice, however, this place manages to be magical. Intoxicating. They may or may not put pheromones in the air ducts; I haven't ruled it out as a possibility yet.#1: The South End is charming as hell. Oh, quaint brownstones, how I wish I could afford to live in you! It's not a neighborhood we non-wealthy inhabitants of Boston have much opportunity to frequent...nor is it a neighborhood a tourist would spend time in unless you had an awesome spot like The Beehive to make the destination.#2: The ambiance. What The Beehive is all about. Dark but not creepy, with a warm, comfortable vibe. You'll want to \"stay awhile.\" Downstairs is the place to be for the live music. There isn't a bad seat in the house, and the tables aren't set up in a trough-like fashion, giving you and your date plenty of space and privacy. The music is always great -- hard to go wrong with jazz or blues. Added bonus: The music isn't blasting, so you can actually converse with your date if you want!#3: The food. Steak. (For whatever reason, the skirt steak is tastier than the pricier ribeye. Go for the first option with green beans; the au jus makes it.) Tandoori-esque spicy chicken wings with a yogurt/curry/tamarind sauce that catapults them into the \"worth writing home about\" category. The eastern influence of spices shows up again in the cauliflower with harissa -- unusual, delicious, and somewhat addictive.Conclusion: TAKE YOUR DATE HERE! And don't be a pussy about spending money. Split an entree and app, have a drink, and call it a night. You're paying for the whole experience, and this is the kind of stuff that makes up \"a night to remember.\"PS: They have valet if you get sick of dealing with the virtually impossible parking sitch. Yes, more money, but more than worth it to not be bothered.PPS: Funny story I'll share since you read this far. I'm washing my hands in the women's restroom when another woman comes in and remarks, \"LOOK AT THIS PLACE!\" I'm in the midst of being intoxicated by my Beehive experience too, so I say, \"I KNOW!

We made a reservation through Open Table for brunch yesterday and for the most part, everything went very smoothly. We did request on the form to be seated downstairs, though when we arrived we were told that the table they set up for us was upstairs, but we could wait a few minutes for a table to open up downstairs. Luckily it was just a few minutes and when we were seated, we had a great table inches away from the stage.The restaurant itself is gorgeous, with exposed brick, local art and mood lighting galore. It errs on the side of Bohemian, but without being kitschy or over the top.As for the actual food - I was a little apprehensive about what their vegetarian options would be like after reading some of the reviews here that all bemoaned their absence, but was happy to find that at least with the Brunch menu, there was plenty to choose from. We started off with the truffled pierogies for the table which were so good - deep fried and served with a generous amount of sour cream, these made for a perfect starter. I almost wish they were served as an entree because I would be all over that. It was however, kind of expensive for its size and with all the deep fried goodness I couldn't really taste any truffle.For my entree I got the quiche with mushrooms, onions and spinach. First of all - best surprise ever - it came with fries! I'm used to most veggie dished being served signfiicantly fry-less, and as such I was all too happy to dig into these. And these weren't just your average fries, but thinly cut wedges crisped to perfection with just the right amount of salt. So so good.The quiche itself was equally good - breaded on both the top and the bottom, with the eggs in the center tasting creamy and smooth and the vegetables wonderfully cooked. I tried a bit of their Shakshuka as well - while it wasn't exactly authentic (I've had Shakshuka many different ways but never with polenta), it was an original and delicious spin on the classic. They have quite a few mixed drinks to choose from, though they are all pretty expensive. I do recommended their house beer, which is light and smooth and goes down super easy. In general, the dishes aren't cheap, but when you counter in the fact that there's no cover charge for a damn good show, it's really not so bad.And I haven't even mentioned the music! I'm not a huge jazz fan, but played live with wonderful food as accompaniment, everything about it felt so cool. I'm not quite sure how they do it, but the acoustics of the place play up the music while toning down everyone talking around you, so instead of the cacophony you hear at most restaurants this full, you practically feel like you're in the middle of your own personal show.

Both were well-sized and satisfying. Note that the schmaltz fried rice has a lot of heat to it, which wasn't obvious from the menu description. The duck (in the duck au poivre) was cooked well, not a bit overdone, although slightly bland for my tastes. I enjoyed the flavors in the fried rice, but it really did end up being too spicy for me. The cassoulet was my favorite, especially the duck confit and the red beans.

The last two times I've dined there have been terrible. I ate there in January on my birthday, my filet was under cooked, I sent it back, they threw it under the salamander and cooked it until it was chard and returned the same piece to me. It was disgusting. The manager himself dropped it off, when he returned 10 minutes later to check on me, I explained to him I was surprised it was the same pieced and that it was now dry and over cooked. He apologized and admitted he hadn't check it before dropping it off. So I had to wait another 15 minutes while I watched everyone else eat on my birthday. Strike 1! Last week I dined there for my sisters birthday. I decided to stray from my usual filet because of the previous experience and ordered the couscous. It was terrible, I could barely manage to eat 3 bites of it before my heartburn kicked it. Unfortunately that wasn't the worse part of the evening. Our waiter Joshua, over charged my credit card. When I questioned him, he realized he had charged the table next to us on my card instead. Which left me feeling very uneasy. He just laughed it off, and processed my card for the right amount. I didn't make a big deal about it because we were celebrating my sisters birthday and I didn't want to put a damper on the mood. However I called on Friday to explain the situation, and question why the $95 mistaken charge was still pending in my bank account, I was told I would get a call back from a manger and never did. I called back Saturday morning, and never heard back from a manager. I called back a THIRD time on Sunday, and was told the manager would call me back MONDAY. We're talking about a issue that accrued Thursday night. I stressed the fact that I needed to hear back from a manager today. Finally a half hour later Sean the GM called me. He was very nice, but I still have a bad taste in my mouth. I'm still in awe that I had to call 3 times to hear a response from a manger.

When the server brought the scallop chow fun, the noodles looked right, texture-wise, but they tasted way too salty. Black bean sauce is salty people! No need to be so heavy handed with it! Also, when you have a chow fun dish, it is acceptable to have some larger cut, not-too-crunchy vegetables like broccoli or green beans. Littering the plate with random bits of celery, edamame, and who knows what else, so that you have to sort of shovel it onto your fork while there wasn't really room for their oversized pieces of chow fun made for an awkward dish. Someone failed to tell the chef that not only is black bean sauce salty, but also that in Chinese food, size does matter. And celery on chow fun just doesn't work. Plus the scallops weren't good. They were thin and dry. Trying to get rid if it maybe?My Bostonian friend had the cod aka salmon on pea sprouts and it was good. A 4 stars dish. The amber ale was good, smooth and tasty.

The sauce is spiced with maybe a gabillion spices (or less), a nice bed of polenta sits under it as well as on the side, and two really quite beautiful poached eggs sit on the other side.When, after the longest moments of your life because the smell screams at you to pick up the whole dish and slide it into your mouth, you do pierce an egg, the warm yolk mixes effortlessly into the pepper-strewn chunky sauce. Mere mortals cannot resist using not only the bread it comes with but also their fingers and ultimately their tongues to savor every last flavor.And when all is said and done (to the tunes of mighty fine jazz I might add), you'll ponder your $14 Shakshuka and think \"I could make that at home.\" But you never will be able to replicate it quite exactly, even if to do so would cost only about a buck.

We usually look for an upscale restaurant and have a great meal, but this time we wanted good food AND atmosphere. We made reservations on OpenTable, which, as always, was very easy. In the notes, I mentioned that it was our anniversary and that we'd like a good view of the band. Upon arriving, we decided to valet the car since parking in that area can be a nightmare. We were about 15 minutes early, and upon checking in the hostess wished us a happy anniversary. Since we still had some time, we went over to the bar for a couple drinks. The hostess said they would text us when the table is ready, which was a great idea because I hate those dirty, germy buzzers most restaurants have. At the bar, I tried the Queen Bee which wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. Right on time, we got the text and expected to head to a table downstairs near the band. Instead, they led us to a small row of tables near the bar that overlook the downstairs area and have a great view of the band. This was great, as the downstairs area was busy, crowded and noisy. Our waiter came over and he also wished us a happy anniversary. The level of communication at the Beehive is excellent, as a few minutes later the manager stopped by to wish us a happy anniversary as well. They really went above and beyond to make us feel special. We ordered the Calamari app, which was delicious (and you know how calamari can go either way) and some drinks (the Arroyo for me, the Kentucky Orchard for my husband). The drinks were VERY tasty and we each had several of those throughout the night. Mixed drinks generally seem to be in the $10-15 range, which is average for Boston. Unfortunately, their online menu wasn't updated and the scallops dish I had seem prior to our visit wasn't available. I had a steak which came with fries drenched in gravy (SO good). The steak was okay, really nothing special in terms of seasoning but it was cooked just right. My husband had the duck and loved it. Throughout our first drinks and appetizer, there was a band playing downstairs. Once their set ended, there was a bit of a gap in entertainment and another band didn't start up again until the end of our meal. From our seats, we overlooked the lower dining area but directly beyond that gap is a wall with two crawl spaces. In between those spaces is an area of wall upon which they projected some sort of old, semi-risque movie. It was nice to have something playing while the band was offstage. We were told to hand our server our valet ticket about ~10-20 minutes prior to leaving, so we did that and our car was ready almost immediately after we stepped outside (which was perfect as it was freezing). Overall, we had a great experience at the Beehive and will definitely be back. The only area for improvement that I could identify was the bar area. It's directly next to the upstairs seating area, and I could see diners getting bumped constantly as people tried to maneuver around the crowded bar. I understand that they want more tables, but it probably makes sense to remove a couple tables and open that area up.", "Date": "2014-03-05", "Author_Location": "Revere, MA"}, {"Author": "Evan A.", "ReviewID": "6cLdgIe8ddvOlFafhFe8-w", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really disappointed. We (party of 3) got here at 7:45 on a Thursday night without a reservation, and were told that there was one party of 3 ahead of us. We weren't in a rush so we said cool, we'll sit at the bar and wait. We checked the wait about a half hour later and were told there were now a few parties ahead of us. After nearly an hour, we checked again, and were told we were \"on the list,\" but they could not estimate a time. So we ordered appetizers at the bar. After an hour and a half we were getting annoyed but the hosts at the front, for some reason, could neither explain what was happening nor tell us how long the wait was. Let me be clear: we were fine with waiting. What was annoying was being told there was just one party ahead of us, and then told over and over that there was no way to estimate how long it would be, but that we couldn't sit down. We finally just ordered dinner at the bar. We'd been there almost 2 hours when the host came over and said there was a table, but at that point it was really pointless to move. The food was pretty good, though a little overpriced. My scallops were $28 and came with only 3 scallops. We ate pretty fast because we really just wanted to leave by that point.

Admittedly, it would have been nice if we had tried it beforehand. Anyway, for starters, their reservation policies seem overly intense. From requiring your credit card to threatening you with giving away your table, one gets the sense that they believe their patrons to be small children. We also had the bad luck of not overlapping with live music (no early act that day). It would have added to the atmosphere if we could have had some jazzy background music, but it was fine. Anyway, we managed to secure our table and the servers were nice except that they couldn't seem to hear most of what we were saying (as witnessed by some funny gaffes) due to the (non-live) music. I liked the vibe in general. It's nice to go somewhere that doesn't feel generically upscale so even if it's a little faux-20s, I'll take it. My dish was also good which was the lamb and chicken couscous. The portion was huge to match. Our friends seemed to enjoy their swordfish tacos so score for them. My husband however was not fond at all of his brisket which he and our friend's date agreed was not, in fact, a brisket at all being not the right cut. I am not an expert on such matters so I only pass on this information. While I was happy to have a drink option for $8, the sangria was GOD-AWFUL. Possibly the worst drink I have ever had while dining out, or in. I had searched the reviews ahead of time to see if others enjoyed the sangria and it seemed like most did with some objecting that it was terrible. I'm sorry, but have those of you who liked it ever had other sangria or made your own? I'm no connoisseur, but there should be red wine involved. My friend, who complained and then inexplicably ordered another?, compared its taste to fruit punch or kool aid. It was made worse by the fact that the waiter insisted that it was the height of deliciousness when we ordered it. Bleck! In short, I hesitate to say that I liked the Beehive. It was a very uneven experience and I found some of it odd. I am told that I should try out their jazz brunch.

We sat down and were immediately greeted by someone offering us waters and then by our waiter. He was awesome, always checking in with us with a smile and great attitude. It was a bit loud with the music but that isn't a knock against The Beehive... In fact, the music was great and I had intentionally made our reservation so it overlaped both bands. The food was great. We had the calamari, the truffled potato & cheese pierogies for apps and the swordfish tacos and vegetarian couscous for entrees. All brought out hot and were very good. For drinks: queen bee, strawberry margaritas, and a couple glasses of wine; all were great.Overall, staff was awesome, food was great, and the music was excellent.Two tips: (1) Use their valet.. Street parking stinks and it's only $16. (2) They ask that you only sit for 2 hours so that they can be fair to other parties. Music runs from 630-830pm and 930-130am, so make your reservation from 8-10pm.

My fianc\u00e9 and I had drinks before our friends got there (my mixed drink was really good- something involving cider and cranberry vodka), and then had wine and dinner. Our waitress was really sweet and super attentive. The fries were an interesting cut and well-seasoned, and we all but licked the plate. My scallops (served with a blood orange sauce) were pretty good- I wouldn't order them again just because scallops are so expensive and I wasn't obsessed with them. Everyone else was crazy about their food, including my fianc\u00e9's filet mignon. We happily ate and drank and stayed for the band's entire set.

A group of 6 ladies had a standing reservation for a late dinner reservation-around 8:45PM on a Friday night, I believe. The hostess had asked at the time of reservation if we would be having dinner or just getting drinks. We said we would be eating, so a dinner reservation was made and a credit card number was taken. We were a few minutes late to our reservation but no worries, we were seated promptly and professionally. Our server, a wonderful person, came over after a few minutes to introduce herself and ask for our drink orders. We put them in, but were still working on what we want for dinner. A few minutes later she returns and we start naming off the appetizers and entrees that we all intend on sharing. A look of concern comes over her face, and she asks us if we intend on eating appetizers or entrees. We say we were planning on sharing whatever we ordered-appetizers and entrees included. She whisks off to speak with a manager across the restaurant, uh-oh. She returns apologetically and informs us that she's sorry the hostess didn't tell us when we made the reservation, but tables are only reserved for those who are planning on ordering \"one entree minimum per person.\" We will be allowed to stay at our table for another 45 minutes (when the table is next \"reserved\") but then we will have to leave-unless we each order an entree. We let her know that we would happily make up the cost of an entree each in drinks and more appetizers but no, the manager decided that we weren't worth the business if we didn't order one.entree.per.person. Obviously, at this point we were very embarrassed and felt conned. We are young 20-somethings, when we think \"dinner\" we don't necessarily think \"sit down to an entire steak on a Friday night with your girlfriends and their entire steaks.\" \u00a0We share, we talk, we have fun. This seemed like a talking, having fun, listening to music while dining kind of place. But it is also apparently a place with a dinner minimum! If we had known about the rule, we would have made our reservation elsewhere! So, we rush through our meals (we ordered enough to be full, that's for sure!), pay our bill, and sit chit-chatting for a few minutes until the time at which we assume our 45 minutes would be up. At some point after we paid our waitress reemerges and lets us know that the restaurant isn't as busy as they assumed it would be-so we \"would be allowed to stay at our table if we wanted.\" \u00a0Are you kidding me, Mr. Manager? After embarrassing guests who were genuinely excited to patron your establishment, you let us know that it's ok to stay and spend money with you because you're \"not as busy as you thought you would be?\" Avoiding embarrassing guests would be easy \u00a0if the hostesses made it very obvious that customers were expected to order at least one entree per person in order to make a worthwhile reservation. And if the situation arises so that the guests aren't aware, the management staff should have enough grace to suck up the \"damage\" and not make their guests feel like worthless patrons unworthy of space in their establishment.

She walked me through the history and inspiration of the establishment: La Ruche (French for the beehive) was where artists from all over the world gathered in France in the 20's. it was cheap housing for artists and penniless souls. Thus, what they wanted to recreate is what dinner would be like had it been at La Ruche in the 1920s. They have wine from all over the world: a plavac from Croatia by the glass?? They have lots and lots of sparkling wine because champagne is the most affordable form of luxury. They have dishes inspired by Moroccan, Korean, Poland, Germany, Italian and American cuisine. The portions were huge because they are feeding poor artists here. It's gotta be comfort food. She suggested the pierogies app and I was like, yes on truffle oil please. For entrees, She first ask what I like for flavor and protein: seafood, pork, beef, spicy, smoky, light? She then suggested the pork Osso buco because I seemed like I'd appreciate off-the-bone braised pork shank, on the bone, marrow and everything! She use the words \"Asian approved\" pork dish and I bought into it after she then described the warm German potato salad with whole grain mustard and relish. I got it and marveled at its size.

When I said that on the Open tables App, there was an open reservation for 9PM and should we have just reserved for that, the hosts said that we should just wait and that opening doesn't exist.Finally, at 9:30, one of the hosts said that we could sit down at a table by the bar. At this point we had already ordered the three entrees. He said that he could give me a card so that next time we could make a reservation. What. I don't want a card. I should've just made the reservation on Open tables if we knew that your list was not really a list.

I originally made a reservation for 6 that turned into 8 with some parties being drinks-only and some parties being the whole meal shebang. It was a rainy school night, so the waitress allowed us to all sit together at a table, but she noted that this was going to be an exception and not the rule. The night we went, the music event was a pair of French jazz flautists leaning towards electronic dance. It was interesting and appropriate for a girls' night (not particularly romantic). We were sitting stage right and basically had to yell the entire night. We had a good time, nonetheless, but if it had been a first date, it might have been better to be seated further away or upstairs.The food was decent. Creative menu and delicious cocktails!Sunday Brunch:This is their pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance! Again, I highly recommend making reservations.

Luckily a few seats at the bar opened up and we got to feed our rumbling stomachs right away. We shared a calamari and the fris\u00e9e salad which came with duck bacon, poached egg, pear slices and a blue cheese dressing. The calamari was crispy, not too oily and tender. The added jalape\u00f1o added a nice kick. I liked the duck bacon, my first time eating it and was a good balance with the sweet pears. They drenched the salad with a little too much dressing so my advice would be to ask for it on the side.For entrees we shared their famous short rib grilled cheddar and fontina cheese on Texas toast and an eggplant and spinach Parmesan. Both were awesome. Who doesn't love tender short rib sandwiched between cheese toast! For drinks I got a queen bee and a sangria. The queen bee wasn't that sweet and the grapefruit juice added a refreshing touch to it. The sangria although a little sweet was good. Definitely left overnight with some fruits!

There is just something about the way they manage people that completely irks me.

On a weeknight, you can snatch an empty table after 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. (I really can't remember which), but on the weekends, all tables are off limits unless you have a dining reservation or it's 1:00 a.m. I hate that about this place.What I love is... everything else!

There is a cool, speakeasy vibe permeating the entire building. Oh, and the food, it is remarkable. I have yet to eat something here I haven't liked. The calamari is out-of-this-world good -- some of the best I've ever had. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth while the batter is light but crunchy and well-seasoned. I missed the flat-bread pizza on the menu during my most recent visit. They changed these artisanal pizzas regularly, but the combinations always delivered. Last but certainly not least, your visit is not complete without a sampling of the smoothly crafted, signature cocktails.

It's basically impossible for this girl to be mean, and she's from Manhattan and used to restaurants being uptight. The host jumped down her throat.

It has a kind of speakeasy vibe, combined with the chicness of a NYC basement club and the grandiosity of a theater. Sit downstairs to enjoy the dark elegance of heavy curtains, ruffled backdrops, and gilded mirrors. Sit upstairs in the loft area for a birds eye view of the band and a startling glimpse down the stone corridors that seem to run along the ceiling, decorated with plastic mannequin arms, for intrigue.I've never had dinner here, but I've done late night drinks and brunch. The late night scene is hot, with live jazz musicians playing from the stage, and strong, confidently-priced cocktails. It caters to the more swanky crowd, but I felt at ease here in nice jeans, a sweater, and a credit card. It stayed busy and kept me entertained all the way til closing time.Brunch was unexpectedly decadent. My friends and I enjoyed the jazz band's groove as we waited, then completely zoned in on the rich, generously sized food. I wisely ordered the Eggs Shakshuka (\"a real bohemian breakfast,\" they say), which included 3 fried eggs over creamy polenta and North African spiced tomato stew, served with crispy pita chips. Not only was it delicious, but it was innovative and fairly priced at $11.Before you leave, be sure to stop in the bathroom. If you can see anything at all (it's very dark, be warned), you might marvel the way I did at the funky-chic painted stall doors and long, old-fashioned tub-style sink. Best of all, feast your eyes on the hot, tattooed, corseted pinup girl in the photograph hanging above you as you wash your hands...

We were promptly sat in front of the stage. Front and center, and couldn't help but feel like this was prearranged by destiny. Our conversation went like thisBoy -\"This was your plan all along wasn't it\"Me - \"yes, there's been something I've been wanting to ask you.\" *clenches hands across table**gets down on bended knee\"Dave, I propose....that WE WATCH ALL THREE FINAL DESTINATION MOVIES TONIGHT\"Boy- \"I accept your proposal\"*crowd goes wild*I ordered the Rasputin martini, hard cider and cinnamon liquor paired with some mystery liquor that I can't remember and boy ordered a mint julep, just for sillyness. The julep was delicious, and spewing with fresh mint leaves. We put in an order for a farmhouse cheddar and tomato grilled cheese and an order of french toast so we could have a little breakfast AND lunch. The bread on both was fantastic. Thick slices slightly crisped. The french toast was so delicious with the real maple syrup and cherry compote that it almost felt slightly like a dessert, and it was slightly burnt, but more in the way that sugar tastes when it's burnt, so it was just a little bit sweet. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and accomodating, and the setting is probably one of my new favorites in the city. All too often, when it comes time for brunch, we're launched into some sunny window left to drool over a fluffy omelet and some greasy tater tots. But not here.

Cheesy pun aside, I think I've just found one of my new favourite places in Boston.Ironically, one of the things I love so much about this place is the fact that I no longer feel like I'm in Boston when I'm in there - there's really nowhere else I've seen like it around here. And it's open late too - with food! I hardly know where to begin. The decor is absolutely gorgeous - tall ceilings, exposed brick, warm and low lights, and lots of eclectic and unique artwork. I love the chandeliers all over the place; they make me want to go home and deck my home out the same way. The entire place just oozes an earthy yet glamorous, sexy and lively mood which I just fell in love with, and is the kind of place that just brings out all the good things in life: yummy eats and drinks, lively and captivating conversations, and good-mood vibes from all around! The excellent live music is just the cherry on the cake.I have to join in with the praises for live jazz and blues, particularly on Wednesday nights - not only is the music fantastic, but the musicians themselves are clearly enjoying themselves so much that their enthusiasm is infectious. The serving staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful, not pushy in the slightest, and are all genuinely nice and chilled out. I am even more impressed at how together everything seems, great service included, even on a visit so soon after opening.Not only do they have great decor in the main areas, they also have really fun artwork, and such a huge variety - ranging from African statuettes to cartoony prints, to punk-like art, to framed butterflies and everything else in between. It's the sort of place I can (and did) see people from many different age groups and backgrounds all fitting in.Since I've raved about the decor of the place, I certainly can't leave out the bathroom - fabulous! The girl's bathroom is really clean, beautiful, with the gorgeous prints on the walls and cool details everywhere.

Our waiter, Jason, was really kind and patient while we were indecisive over the menu and none of us were feeling 100% that morning. One in our group wasn't feeling well from the get-go. Unfortunately it was a strike of the stomach flu so when she ended up getting sick, Jody and Christina rushed to help with club soda, napkins, etc. They were incredibly understanding and helpful.As far as food, two of us had an omelette that was the size of half of the large plate that came with a small salad and home fries. The veggies it was loaded with tasted fresh and it came out piping hot. None of us tried their drinks, despite the prodding of the waiter.

I, nor have anyone in my family, had this happen before and probably never will again, so I must put an extra commendation for that. I mean honestly!So what's with Beehive? They've settled into their location pretty well, staff should be well serviced, the bartenders should know how to make their drinks, everything should be pretty much in its own direction. It's working pretty well all together.They seated us upstairs, which made me a bit less hopeful as I really prefer the downstairs, but it wasn't really as much of a problem as I thought it was going to be.We had the Calamari, and the bread and caviar for apps, and both were delectable, if only marred by the fact that the caviar bread was a little small. Calamari was excellent and contained various fried veggies along with it, with an awesome sauce.I ordered my usual Beehive Juleps and No. 8, which are a bit pricey at 10 dollars a piece, but more than drinkable, and always taste fine, and went well with my \"Sloppy Lasagna\", which was a perfect balance between lighter fair and heavy sauce laden restaurants where they melt a stick of butter just so people feel like they're \"eating out\" enough. The sauce surprised me with just a little bit of spice in it that it remained memorable, but not too hot that I couldn't eat it.For dessert, there was baklava for all, and instead of being something that could typically send a rhino into an insulin shock, I got a gentle sweetness I've never associated with the dish. Kudos to the pastry shop who made it. Good coffee for once too!One little thing that seemed off is that the hostess and the busgirls seemed to be kind of slacking in the dress department.

I picked them for the spot of my 29th bday. I called two weeks in advance to book a table for 16 during their Jazz Brunch. Even with weeks notice, I had to bump up the time I orginally wanted, which was not that big of a deal. Hey- you're popular, Beehive. I get it. When the lady booking my reservation let me know that we'd have to be at two tables- only 12 people can sit at one table. Being together was important- who wants to be split across two tables? So, I made mental note and only brought 12 people to the brunch. They sat us quickly- at 2 tables. I couldn't believe that was happening. I suggested everything- pushing the tables together, joining with a smaller tables. Beehive wouldn't have any of it. Thus, my friends awkwardly had to chose tables and I had to bounce back and forth. LAME. We even got different waiters and our food came out at different times. Double LAME.Our waitress was one of those \"I'm too cool to actually be informative/sarcastic/hungover\" type. When I asked for guidance on the menu she just said, \"We're the Beehive. We don't suck.\" I ordered the salmon eggs benedict. It didn't suck... but I sure didn't want to be paying $14 for it. The salmon was completely overpowered by other flavors and ended up just being a slimey texture.Even though my reservation was booked as a birthday, my friends brought me a cupcake and sang me happy birthday, no mention ever came from Beehive or our too cool waitress. A complete letdown. I was so disappointed. I emailed Beehive later that week and they emailed me back that they would \"look into it\". I had to keep emailing for an answer of why we couldn't have sat together, had the same waiter or celebrated my birthday... none really ever came. Just an offering for a gift card, which I accepted.

Coincidentally, the week before the NY Times called this newcomer to Boston's nightlife scene The Place To Be. I expect a Crowd (with a capital \"C\").

It was Monday night, and there was a band playing that one of my friends was interested in. We'd heard good things, so we were optimistic when we got there. However, although the band was good, everything else was rather decidedly poor.Accessibility: 3.5/5For anyone north of the river (I'm in Somerville), it's a pain to get to. Heck, for almost anyone, it's a pain. Parking isn't great, and T service is a bus, which is unreliable at best. Who knows when any given line stops running? It's quite inconsistent. It's about a 20-minute walk from Boylston. \u00a0[edit: I've been alerted to the existence of the Orange Line--oops--so I've bumped accessibility from 2 to 3. Back Bay is 5 blocks or so away. For some reason, MBTA Trip Planner ignores this fact, even when you select \"Rail only.\" It actually suggested to just take the Red Line from Davis to Broadway and walk 27 minutes. What?!?!]Music: 5/5I think this is the restaurant's strong point. Live music, yet you don't have to give your full attention to it. There's an alcove where the real audience all sits and faces the band, \u00a0la a jazz club like Scullers or Ryles, but the rest of the (downstairs) restaurant and the bar function autonomously, while still getting to enjoy the music.Atmosphere: 4/5Had the interior designer taken it a step further, the dcor would have felt forced. The exterior seats at tables were rather like park benches, but it worked. There was a sort of art-deco, European, and modern feel balance of the decoration, which worked. It was a one-of-a-kind type of feeling; you couldn't be anywhere else but the Beehive, and I like that they're able to establish an identity like that.Drinks: 3/5Their drinks menu was decent. The best, surprisingly, was the beer, which seemed under-priced compared to everything else on the menu. 20oz was 5.50 or 6, while at many other restaurants a pint is $5. The wine list was unexceptional to me, but I'm not the best person to judge. It was also the sort of list that brings to mind the rule of thumb, if bottles start at $30 and go up, go with a less expensive one, as all the wines will be of good quality.Food: 1/5Generally, if I go to a place for dinner, the food is what's going to be what lends the most to a good experience. If I'd just come here for music and drinks, I probably would have rated it 3 or 4 stars. But I didn't. I came, ready to spend a bit more than I usually do, because I'd heard good things. The chef, Adam Halberg, came over from Via Matta, one of the best restaurants in town. I wasn't impressed. I had an $8 gazpacho soup. It was OK, but it was just gazpacho. I expected something to be unique about it, something that said there was some innovation. Nothing.Someone else in my party ordered the gazpacho, too, but asked for it without sour cream, which came in a big dollop at the bottom. At first she thought they'd been able to do that, but apparently they just gave her a smaller dollop. Oops. Being vegan, that made her entre a little less enjoyable.My entre was fish (grouper, I think), over succotash. It might have been a special. It was OK, but for a $25 entre, with Adam Halberg pulling the strings, I expected a bit more panache in the flavor.Service: 3/5Service was mediocre. It was definitely brought down by the gazpacho incident (granted, that could have been the kitchen's fault, but the server's the representative/point of contact to customer service for the restaurant as far as a table's concerned), and all night he didn't seem to be on his A-game in terms of attentiveness, knowledge, or friendliness.In spite of giving it 2 stars, I'd go back, just not for dinner.

They had a Turkey Day special going and live bands lined up... seemed like the perfect plan. Little did I know that our day was going to be soured by the diabolical Thanksgiving Scrooge posing as our waiter.Where to begin?? Let me start by saying that we were seated at the ONLY table in the entire downstairs area without any possible view of the band. (Who were pretty damn good and I would have liked to have seen!) We were, however, very near to the outdoor entrance where smokers popped in and out every 2 minutes to remind us just how frigid Boston can be on November nights. When we asked Se\u00f1or Scrooge if we could be moved to a different table, he was just about as cold as the arctic wind coming in the back door. Ouch!Beehive had a special menu for T-day, with 4 or 5 different fixed options to suit all tastes. Each of us in our 3-person group got something different (turkey, venison, and steak), and every single one of us was disappointed. The venison and the steak were COLD, and the turkey you could call lukewarm but maybe only from overcooking. Worst of all was our douchebag of a waiter. (WHY didn't I get his name so I could trash talk him specifically instead of this beautiful waste of a restaurant??) I know nobody likes to work on holidays, but if he'd at least half attempted to hide his contempt I'd probably have tipped him well above average for the trouble. Or not. Tool. Never once did Scrooge bother to see how our food was. Not. Freaking. Once.

On Sundays & Mondays they have a special burger menu, which was amazing and moderately priced. There was a female singer that night, who was a great singer.

To drink, I started out with the Honey Lavender Whiskey Fizz ($10.50) and then later had the Lulu ($10.50). My friend ordered a beer and then the Cranberry Winter Mojito ($10.50). I loved my whiskey fizz drink, but it didn't taste that strong to me, so I switched to the Lulu. I think the Lulu was made wrong, or I just didn't like one of the ingredients- it was very sour and I couldn't drink it. The waitress didn't ask me if it tasted okay, despite the fact that it was sitting on the table for an hour or so, and I hate complaining at restaurants so I just let it go. However, my friend's cranberry winter mojito was yummy.For our meals, my friend got the roast cod with broccoli rabe and pasta ($22). I tasted the pasta (I don't like fish) and it was really good. Their burger menu isn't online, but I believe the burgers were about $14-16. I had the hamburgeois, and it was amazing. It came on a baguette with a lot of different things- pickles, mustard, brie, aioli sauce, etc. It was really delicious, I ate it all, and I was stuffed afterward.

It was perfectly crisp and didn't fall apart and wasn't too spicy w the peppers. \u00a0The pizza was just as good. It was the perfect size and we very much enjoyed it. The toppings and texture were well done. By the time we finished the app's we were almost full!For our second course she ordered Grilled Skirt Steak w mash potatoes I believe. I ordered the Chicken Paillard. \u00a0I wasn't too sure what to expect from my dish but when it came I was very impressed and happy with it. It was perfectly cooked, the toppings and side were delicious as well. The cheese was melted on top of the chicken and the rosemary was the right touch. \u00a0The steak my friend got looked great. I could tell it was very prime meat and good quality. \u00a0We were very happy with our meals. \u00a0I was just able to finish it and then it was time for our third course.I got the Cheesecake which was one of the best slices I have ever had. The style and toppings on it were unreal. She got some type of chocolate cake that looked so good I was hoping she would go to the bathroom so I could finish it off. So after visiting it for Restaurant Week I am a fan, and would love to go back again.

That's all I can really say; it's not awful but in the times that I have come back after the first occasion, I have not eaten here, and dishes look to have declined in both quality and appeal.Sometimes there's a cover, which doesn't seem all that bad, but when you hear that there's a $20 admission tacked on to your night, it's enough to make me want to turn around and head elsewhere.

Ok, now you're thinking, \"Wow, this place sounds great, why 3 stars?\" Well, while this place is different in many ways, it also falls into the same trap as so many brand new venues garnering early buzz - they are high on themselves, Throughout the night on Saturday there were at least 50 people outside in line. The only reason the line got shorter is that people left to go somewhere else. 45 minutes later I got in - mostly because all the people in front of me left to go to Sibling Rivalry - and the place wasn't even crowded. Also, the bouncer and night manager smiled a total of three times and were only friendly to people they knew, letting in over 40 FOB, Friends of The Beehive, ahead of the line.

We ordered 2 apps - the sausage and cheese plate (good sausage, not much cheese though), and the Mediterranean / hummus dish (very tasty, excellent pita chips and hummus dips). I got the tuna entree with couscous - wow--- very good! Tuna was probably a B+ but the couscous and vegetable medley it was served with was A+. The other gals got the dinner salad, all of which were good too. Drinks: I ordered the Bee-Lini (champagne and apricot nectar). At $10.50 a pop, definitely overpriced but it is quite tasty and refreshing on a warm summer night. Atmosphere: patio is awesome to sit outside and people watch on Tremont St. We didn't wait long for it either - we had a 7:30 pm reservation (Thurs night) and were lucky enough to be seated immediately at an outdoor spot. No music out there though, which is one of the unique parts about the interior of this restaurant/bar. Service: C-. Took forever to receive our drinks and food. Two hours for a two-course meal is pretty unacceptable in my book. Also, the patio menu is a limited version of the full menu so you can get the signature Pierogies that others rave about.

Not quite sure what all the buzz is about . . .Went here for Restaurant Week last night. I was in great company, but the food--and the service--was only so-so. Here's why:For starters (literally--and literally), they let us order both of the appetizer options in substitution of ordering the dessert off the RW menu. That was pretty cool--especially since both appetizers sounded delish: a mushroom bisque with a molten brie crouton (more of a croquette, really) and some petite, whole-bellied Ipswich fried clams with a grannysmith aoli. Dinner itself was nothing to write home about (but, still, worth writing about to the Yelp community): a few small scallops skewered with some veggies and drenched in an overpowering BBQ sauce. The lentil salad that it all sat on top of was decent. In all, it tasted like one of those Healthy Choice frozen entrees. A sodium bath does not elevate mediocre-quality food to a higher standard, sorry. My friend had the duck confit shephard's pie. She didn't seem too into it, to tell the truth--and we're some ladies who love our food.Oh well. I love the South End--and my friends. So it was a great time nevertheless.Ah, yes--service! I know it was super-crowded, but they were very, very slow. And a personal pet peeve: it drives me nuts when servers ask how everything is and you haven't even brought the fork up to your mouth yet. Lastly, the very friendly server (I think she'd be fun to chat with at a bar--and I suspect she'd be an excellent server if the place wasn't so crazy crowded--and it was just a Tuesday!) complimented my friend on her stylish handbag--and then proceeded to tell us that she has the same one. Got it for $10 on the streets of NYC. It was kind of like the \"fake Fendi\" faux pas on Sex & the City. Not everybody is all about the cheap knock-offs.Lastly, the music--what this joint is all about.

That was a lot less painful than it could've been, since the bar was right there. We ordered cocktails and stood around in a circle. Hah... cute, I guess. I ordered a cocktail with Godiva chocolate liqueur that sounded pretty exciting. It was good, but not as smooth as I expected.

So, I like to be seated close to the stage, if not I rather prefer be at the bar and have the chance to enjoy the music even if I am not able to see the stage. Being in the big dinning area feels like you are not there because of the live music. It feel likes they are playing a background music no matter you will listen those spontaneous lyrics that musicians do in a concert. You definitely won't see the stage from that area.

Not really sure why I didn't, but thanks to the official approval of a highly trusted fellow foodie friend, I decided to give it a go for Restaurant Week (which the aforementioned friend is adamantly against, for the most part, so I took that to mean he genuinely agreed with the place).Came with 2 friends and were able to sit outside on the reasonably spacious, charming patio area. It's first come, first serve though, and you must have the whole group together to be seated, so I guess we were lucky. Super cute, though. We were seated for nearly 40 minutes before our drinks came, which was kind of annoying to say the least. Our server Jacob couldn't have been nicer, and the weather was great, so we weren't too worked up. Generally unacceptable in my book otherwise. We all did the prix fixe menu, and our choices were as follows:apps:lentil salad - good, nothing fancy but tastytruffle pierogis with arugula and sour cream - delicious. heavy and high on the grease factor, but the arugula toned it down a bitmain:haddock - delicious, hugechicken piccata w gnocchi- giant portion (3 chicken breasts?!), very garlicy and creamy, quite heavyduck breast over fried rice and plum sauce - though it was ordered medium, it was most definitely well done which kind of ruined it...Jacob offered to refire a new one, but I'm not a fan of eating alone so I sucked it up. It was good - it's duck afterall - but dry.dessertpot de creme - to die for. hit the spot. so rich without being overwhelming... perfect. too bad i didn't order it myself...fruit cobbler - ..... I can't quite express how sad I was over this. To me, a cobbler is 80% about the crust and 20% the actual fruit. What I got was a scoop of ice cream over a pool of preserves and some sort of soggy bits of crust or bread-like substance floating about. Nothing like the flaky, warm, delicious cobblers I've experienced in the past (Les Zygomates anyone?)To drink, I got a Bee Julep -- I was extremely tentative about ordering this, after trying my first julep at Citizen Public House and actually cringing at how strong/un-sweet it actually was (and I LOVE my drinks strong) -- but it was delicious. Sweet and minty, and just the right amount of alcohol. Wish I got to finish it...Our server came to inform us that our desserts were coming and randomly took my friend's and my drink away -- no 'Are you all done with these?' (no, we weren't quite), no 'Can I get you another cocktail?' (you probably could have) -- c'mon Jacob :o( Again, nice guy. Just a little...clueless I guess. Though it may sound like a less-than-thrilling experience, I gave it 4 stars because I know it can be better (or maybe that's just the romantic in me).

Amusing wall art, exposed brick, and chandeliers galore (used in a funky, irreverant way) allow the Beehive to ooze with ambiance. The performance area downstairs is awesome, and the room is designed so that you can see the performers from multiple vantage points. There are two bars, as others have mentioned, one upstairs, and one downstairs. All in all, the attention to detail in terms of the decor is certainly outstanding.In addition to soaking in the sights and sounds of the cavernous downstairs dining and performance areas, my friends and I had dinner at The Beehive. It is an informal atmosphere, so of course the menu reflects this: a couple of enigmatic references (the \"Bohemian Platter\" on the menu came with \"tastey bites\"... unsure of what this was, we asked our waiter, and even he wasn't entirely sure). The servers seemed to anticipate questions about the menu, but were not particularly skilled in answering them. It would be nice if the items on the menu came with a short description. For example, the gazpacho... is it tomato gazpacho? Cucumber? It doesn't say. It also doesn't say there is a dollop of sour cream at the bottom of the bowl, which was fine by me, but repulsive to my friend, who had to request another bowl, hold the sour cream.This leads me to the review of my \"entree.\" I had the grilled chicken with halloumi cheese and a \"bread salad.\" \u00a0I had inquired about said salad before ordering, but it was rather disappointing upon arrival. This \"bread salad\" consisted of a few pieces of greens with oversized, slightly soggy croutons. For $21, I had essentially just received some good chicken, but not much more. Maybe it is just me, but $21 for a piece of chicken is not going to cut it. On the bright side, they have great hummus, but this alone isn't going to make me think about having dinner at The Beehive again. The bottom line is that this is a very cool place to hang out with friends and grab drinks, listen to music, and just generally relax. The environment is relaxed enough so that you will not feel out of place hanging at one of the bars for a good amount of time (which you will want to do to catch some of the live entertainment). I would not, on the other hand, recommend the restaurant at this point in time. It certainly has some interesting components, but the prices are too high for what you receive. Our server was nice, but he was not knowledgeable about the items on the menu, and wasn't very attentive. If I could give a 1/2 a star more, I would, because I think the Beehive is a special place. People should go to experience the ambiance, but it just needs some more work in terms of it being a restaurant. I think I'd be amenable to the offerings and service if it didn't seem to be trying so hard in the restaurant department. I also think the prices could be a bit lower for what is essentially a random assortment of food you're going to be eating while drinking and watching someone perform.Random stuff: I was told on the phone I could only make reservations for groups of 5 or more. Also, despite the chandeliers, this place is pretty casual. In regard to sound, it is loud, make no mistake. But I think this is pretty acceptable given that the space is geared towards performances. Also, sit downstairs, it is cooler.---updated below---Returned on 10/4/07 with 9pm reservations. We got a great table downstairs, and I was surprised to see the menu had changed dramatically since I was last at The Beehive. More substantial entrees and certainly more appetizing as well, so that's a plus. Service was really unfortunate though. A friend and I made the mistake of ordering cocktails (I had the La Vie En Rose), and they were just horrid. They were left on our table the whole time without as much as a second sip, and the waiter never asked us how we liked them. \u00a0All in all, everyone enjoyed their food, although it was still on the pricier side. Waiter cleared our plates, and dropped a saucy fork down the leg of my fiance's pants, saw it, and didn't say a word (not even a half-hearted, \"I'm sorry\"). It took about 30 minutes to get the waiter to come back after clearing everything to get our check. He seemed frazzled and new, but then again, that was exactly how our waiter was the first time I went to Beehive.

I had heard that the Beehive had a good one, so on my next visit to Boston I decided to give it a try. The Beehive's poutine is a brunch version of the traditional dish. Breakfast fries (long, wide and very very thin), a chicken based gravy, a mix of cheddar and fontina cheese in place of the traditional cheddar cheese curds (the traditional unpasteurized curds being hard to find in the US, due to different norms). Not bad. The fontina gives the American cheddar a stronger taste, but definitely not as salty. The fries were so thin that very quickly the sauce turned everything into a mess that I didn't appreciate as much, but the first bites were delicious. What ruined it for me was the egg (over easy) added on top. I understand this is a brunch item, but the mixing of the yoke with the gravy was just disgusting. If you order it, ask them to put the egg on the side so that you can decide if it's for you before ruining an otherwise pretty decent poutine. Is this a poutine you crave?

Since we are all at a baseball game less than two hours earlier, we were in the mood for some more beer. Weirdly, The Beehive had only a single beer on tap so we bought a round of that. Eventually our friend came and a round of old fashions was bought. That's when it came to light that this place is a music venue. Wait, what? Then I noticed that video projected on that weird brick wall at the back of the room. I went closer to take a look, and that's when I realized it was a live video feed of the band that was playing right beneath our feet. Woooooooooooooooooooooooah. We quickly went downstairs and watched an all-girls folk band play until close. As expected, the rest of the night was filled with hypothetical questions about which band member you'd most like to date. I voted drummer, but the keyboardist gave her a run for her money. Actually, I just looked it up and the band was Zili Misik. It looks like they are playing The Beehive AGAIN tonight. They will be on stage there mere hours after I finish this review.

The well-balanced champagne cocktail, La Vie En Rose, contained a lychee infused cognac. Despite the hour, the kitchen stayed open and served a small late-night menu. The frites were hand cut strips of potato that were lightly salted and served with deliciously crispy fried sage leaves.

The quiche itself was super tasty and moist with a nice, buttery crust (ok, not healthy...).Other people at the table got the Pierogies, Beignets, Turkey Hash (I tasted it - very yummy), Eggs Benedict and Salmon Platter.

Maybe it's the semi-darkness of everything, the red, and the cool chandeliers everywhere, but it sort makes me think of hangin out in Dracula's lounge for some reason, if Dracula was a cool kind of guy you'd like to hang out with.

Desserts here are huge and we wound up taking ours home for the next day.We ended up in traffic earlier and had to push back our reservation a couple times, but the staff was accommodating and we were seated right away once we arrived. Our server was lovely and made great suggestions when I asked her opinion about a couple items, and the table (up on top of the balcony on the main level) was perfect - noise level wasn't too high and we could enjoy the old film clips projected against a wall.

The first, we had dinner downstairs during live salsa music, which was really awesome. The atmosphere looks like Urban Outfitters threw up in an unfinished basement- but in a cool way. The second time we went, our server was way too hip (granted lots of the staff and guests alike fit into this category), and he was not helpful nor interested in waiting on us. The group that I was with this time were all bartenders, so obviously it rubbed us the wrong way. This last time, my boyfriend and I went for jazz brunch. We were celebrating \"valentines\" since we both usually work that night. We had a little table close enough to enjoy the music but not too close so we couldn't talk. Our food was unbelievable. I had eggs Benedict and almost cleared the plate. My boyfriend ate the grilled cheese with short rib- we both agreed- it was one of the best sandwiches we had ever tried. The best part of this last visit was our server. I believe her name was Jody. She was the perfect mix of \u00a0a helpful server and a cool hipster chick. She suggested food, cocktails, and even a few places to go for a drink when we left. They should have her train the unpleasant members of the staff. Next time we go back, I am planning to request to sit in her section. She was great and the brunch was awesome. I know that it's a \"too-cool-for-school\" spot in a hip area of Boston, and it was unfortunate to get a server one time that wasn't into it. We love to eat and especially drink, so when we got a server who was so disinterested, it was a big disappointment. BUT our latest girl was able to remain herself while being an awesome server. Our favorite part was when she referred to the short rib as \"the truth\"... Trailing off into space, leaving us with no other choice than to get it and figure out what he hell this chick was talking about. She was right, of course.Love the Beehive.

Everyone from the doorman to the bartender was pleasant (if not a bit flustered on my first visit, 3 days after it opened). The two-level space is divided between the top bar and dining area and the cavernous lower level which itself divided into a large and crowded bar, another dining area, and the live music area. The decor is done in what I would call an artful \"gypsy chic,\" with warm tones and lighting that perfectly compliments. The specialty drinks are all thoughtfully done, and the short but well-selected wine list was not disappointing.The food, normally an afterthought at a jazz bar, shines on its own and keeps up the eclectic theme, but not enough to force you to think too much about it. It's there if you need it.The live music, featuring Caribbean jazz and calypso bands that seemed to play endlessly, seemed to be on point and kept the energy high.Oh, and that \"see and be seen\" crowd? For a place that is billed as a scene, I found very little of the requisite drama. What I did find was an eclectic, diverse group of people who seemed to care less about who saw them and more about having a good time.

So, me and a friend decided to check it out. First, I didn't get a reservation and it was pretty full. But we got seated \u00a0or at least they tried to seat us right away. They seemed to have messed up the seating plan and we were told to follow someone downstairs but when we got there we were told to wait as the host wandered around aimlessly. So, after 5 minutes they sat us at a table. The table was directly in front of the stage but that table should be removed. The table seemed to be in the way of the servers and really didn't fit. Also we seemed to have three different waiters. Maybe they felt bad and added that table in because they messed up. Who knows. They also forgot the bread for the table but once they remembered they brought us three baskets of the course of the dinner.OK, now that I've trashed the place and you will never want to go there. Let me tell you what we did like. The decor and setup was really cool. Very speak easy prohibition style looking. Most tables could see the stage with a live jazz band playing. And when the band took a break they played old black and white films. Although, it was hard to tell which one since it was against a brick wall. The table was cozy for the two of us. They need to get really candles. The electric ones on the table seemed a bit cheesy. But the setup was nicely laid out on white table cloth. The drinks were maid right and to order. She hated my Manhattan with extra cherries and I hated her pear martini. But that's why we order drinks for ourselves not for the other person. They had bitters for my Manhattan which was also a nice. I also had a glass of red wine called 14 hands. Which, I didn't think it was that good. But what can you do. For and appetizer, we had a half dozen raw oysters. They were very tasty and fresh. She had never had raw oysters before and she thought they were fun and tasty. I was glad that they were so fresh for her first time. As Our main course. She had the sea bass with rice pilaf. The fish was cooked well and was not over powered by the lemon flavoring. Her rice was cooked well and she liked it. I had the roast duck and risotto. The duck was cooked perfectly then shredded. The risotto was placed on top. The mixture of rich duck and cheese risotto was amazing. And the portion was huge. I'm a light eater but i didn't even finish a quarter of it.

Is this part of the whole \"vibe\" thing everyone is talking about? I thought it was weird. He was very attentive though. Very confusing... he seemed extremely depressed. Great music, love the set-up of the place, pretty bathroom, love the exposed brick and the architecture and I would certainly come back again. BUT I may have to wait until the weather is warmer. My one major complaint is that this place is FREEZING. The cold wind from the outside comes blowing down the stairs into the dining room every time someone opens the door, which is constantly. I ate with my winter coat on and my back to the wind. Please Beehive, please install one of those wire semi-circular racks around the inside of the front door and hang some of your heavy drapes there. This is so simple!

But after the assurance of our server I gave it a try, and in the end I found that the dish perfectly balanced the slight saltiness of the parmesan cheese, the warm gamey flavor or the duck, and the intensity of the jalape\u00f1o. They give you a very generous helping of the risotto, so I was able to bring plenty home, and couldn't wait to heat it up for lunch the next day.For dessert we shared the maple bread pudding, and following with the rest of our dishes it was absolutely delicious. Two of us weren't huge fans of bread pudding, but to me it tasted like a great french toast with lots of maple-y goodness.In the end, we had a wonderful dinner and reunion at the Beehive.

We couldn't believe it: she was actually getting mad at us for ordering the same drink as a stranger next to us! She seemed to think they should have ordered their drinks together, and when my girlfriend tried to smooth things over, another bartender came along to see what the problem was. I was willing to let it slide and assume that maybe our first bartender was new or found out her grandma died or was just having a bad night, but the second bartender immediately took her side and accused us of trying to make the first bartender run around needlessly, apparently to satiate some sadistic desire to make her suffer. \"Fine, jerks,\" we thought, \"we'll finish our mediocre expensive-ass drinks and take our business elsewhere.\" But when our friend, who had started a tab with her card, tried to pay, she was roundly ignored for over HALF AN HOUR, even as she became more insistent with her waving and pantomime, making it clear that all she wanted was to pay and get out of there. They just smiled, winked, and waved back at her. Finally another man across the bar pointed out our desperate, waving friend to one of the bartenders--\"Hey, I think that girl is trying to get some service\"--and we were finally able to get on with our night at a cheaper, friendly bar.To be fair, the place looks nice and is probably alright if you get a table and have a waitress serve you, but I'll never know because I will never ever go back there again. Seriously, just because we're paying $10-$15 bucks per drink doesn't mean you get to be rude to us. I've worked in far busier places, and being that awful to customers is just unacceptable.

Sit at a tiny table directly next to more people they hate. -Get something they coulda made at home an hour ago for 3 dollars. -Pay 9 bucks for it. -Get rushed out of there -Go home, fall asleep from grease overload. -Take ten dumps. -Forget the experience -Do it again next week Here is how intelligent superhumans like you and I eat brunch: -Get on Open Table and make brunch reservations for you and someone you don't hate at the Beehive. It's an airy, cool, place that reminds me very much of New Orleans and lends itself perfectly to a mid-morning meal. -Request to sit near the stage on your open table reservation. -Walk right in and be lead to your kickass table near the band. -Order some fresh oysters to kick off your meal. The fresh taste of brisk saltwater and cocktail sauce goes great with their excellent bloody mary. -ORDER THE BEIGNETS (New Orleans style doughnuts) with the oysters. They have a hot, fresh, bakery smell that will blow your face off. Now we're having brunch like an adult, not just friggin breakfast around noon. -The blackened salmon sandwich is great, and is served with a unique tartar sauce. Their omelets are better than the sloppy egg water balloons served almost everywhere. Light and fluffy. -Order a couple of adult beverages from their long list of breakfast cocktails. Stop settling for crappy bloody marys at your local slop hole served in a plastic cup with a wilted stalk of celery stuck in it. Try a Beehive Julep (Rum, Liquor Creole, Lime, Fresh Mint) -Pay a very reasonable price for things you probably couldn't make at home. -Walk out feeling like a human being who has just brunched with the best of them.", "Date": "2010-11-10", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Deanna K.", "ReviewID": "kLNO_mYtfLlyyMr4KrkNaA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My fiance and I had heard that the Beehive was good but we were blown away by our experience.

All of our food came out at a great pace considering how busy the kitchen was.

She was prompt, knowledgeable about the menu, and very adept. The ambiance and food make this place.

I have never encountered such a racist and unpleasant bouncer in my life! I barely ever write reviews, but I felt duty-bound to review my experience at the Beehive this last weekend. My friends and I decided to head to the Beehive for some funk music. We were just starting our evening and were all sober, \u00a0and the bouncer let all of us in except for one: a friend visiting from Mexico. To him, he said \"you've had too much to drink, you can't come in.\" We tried to explain that he just has an accent, and that is why his language sounded slurred, but the bouncer just did the tough-looking bouncer thing and said \"I disagree.\" And he later said \"I didn't like this guy's look when I saw him walking over.\" What is THAT supposed to mean? We then waited something like 20 minutes for someone who claimed to be a manager (though he looked like just another bouncer to me) to come out and say that he didn't know whether our friend was drunk but that he had to stand by the first bouncer's opinion and our friend couldn't enter the bar. Now listen: I know bouncers can basically decide who they will or won't let into a bar based on any number of arbitrary reasons. But my reason for writing this review is that we as consumers have to stand up to racism in our community. The bouncer was WRONG about my friend, and based his opinion on the fact that he had an accent. Even then, when we explained the situation, he could have done the decent thing and let him in. It's sad, because the music and the vibe inside the Beehive seemed great, but me and my friends (and hopefully those of you who read this review) won't be back there until the management teaches their bouncers some cultural sensitivity.As a final note: if you've also had a similar experience at the Beehive, I strongly suggest you a) also write a review for people to know what goes on there, and b) contact the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint, because this sort of thing is UNACCEPTABLE.", "Date": "2012-07-23", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Kristen F.", "ReviewID": "SILaqel_VtLtUlVoHWwmbg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Came here Saturday night and although I had a good time, I'm giving 2 stars.

Liked the vibe and the jazz was nice, not overbearing during dinner. Decor is cool, with interesting artwork and objects on the wall (really sweet looking guitar on the back wall). Basement dining can often be cramped, but this place was surprisingly spacious. By the time we were leaving (~ 9p), the crowd was filling in. There is no real separation between the tables and the bar area, so this place could get cramped if you are trying to eat at a table later in the eve.The food was tasty, but a bit overpriced. We sampled a variety of apps, and the fried oysters and the mussels were the stars in the bunch. We were fighting over the bread to try to get at the delicious broth the mussels were cooked in. For dinner, half the table got the scallops with a pumpkin-sage sauce. I don't like to mix my sweets and savories, so this was definitely a risk for me. Thankfully, I was not disappointed! The pumpkin-sage sauce was delicately delicious and sufficiently savory for my liking. I was somewhat disappointed that we had used all the bread for the mussels because I had to resist the urge to lick my plate in front of the coworkers--I can just imagine the water-cooler talk on Monday after a scene like that! Scallops were cooked properly and served over some greens and potatoes. \u00a0Overall delicious, but not quite worth the $23 price tag (for 4 scallops?), in my opinion. Next time, I'm trying one of the grilled cheese sandwiches (with short ribs? really? nice!).I had heard about the drink menu before coming here, so my expectations were high. I'm a B-side girl who is willing to pay a high price for a beverage, but have the expectation that the creation will be delicious and have a high alcohol content. Even with that, $10.50 is a bit high for some of these cocktails. I sampled the Beehive Julep and, although tasty, does not rival a real mint julep. Julep on my mind, my next order was for the real-deal. This is where Beehive disappointed me--overly sweet and grainy sugar at the bottom of the glass, giving me that \"fingernails on a chalkboard\" chill up my spine. Icky! I suppose I should have sent it back, but I sucked it down. Get some simple syrup, folks, and let a girl taste some bourbon! Followed on with a champagne-based beverage (The Crusader--with armagnac and orange liquor). Again, tasty, but the price-tag was a bit steep. Not overly impressed with the cocktails here.My last impression of this place was upon exit. As I mentioned, the place was filling up, but, by no means, close to full. Imagine my surprise when I saw the line-up outside of folks waiting to be allowed in. Not sure what the deal was here, but reminded me of my college days when bars used to do this to make themselves look popular, while they were really just empty inside--kind of like some folks I knew in high school.

We were initially seated in a very sunny spot outside, but requested to be moved because the spot was uncomfortably warm. The man who was initially our waiter very separated two tables for us after telling us it probably wasn't possible to move. After moving we were not acknowledged for quite some time, and were not even sure we had an assigned server. When Michelle finally came over, she asked if we were \"ready to order food.\" I told her we would like to start with the coffee cake, then she immediately said, \"and what do you want to eat?\" She did not offer drinks, and her attitude indicated that she was in a hurry to just get our order without having to come back to the table. A little bit later, the coffee cake and our entrees were put down on our table within just a minute of each other. Michelle walked by our table a couple seconds later and said, \"that looks awesome.\" She did not ask if we needed anything and offered no condiments or anything else. The next time we saw her, she came to our table and looked at our plates, then asked if she could pack up what we hadn't eaten without asking if we needed anything or even if we were finished eating. By this time we had become pretty annoyed with the terrible service and just said she could take the food, but asked if we could have it all in one container. A little while later a hostess came over with a huge paper bag with two separate containers of leftovers. It really isn't a big deal in itself, but on top of everything else it was pretty annoying. This was our third weekend in a row having brunch at the Beehive and we had thought we found a great brunch place we could go to every weekend. However, the service today has made us think twice about whether we want to come back at all. I sent an email with this service issue to the restaurant, but I have yet to hear back and after reading some of the reviews here about uncaring management, I guess I don't expect to. I am giving two stars rather than just the one star I want to give because we have had decent service here before, it's just spotty.EDIT: Two days after sending the email about the bad service I received, I got an email back from The Beehive addressing the issues. The manager who replied was very nice and seemed very concerned. She sent me a gift card and a VIP card to turn the situation around.

We \u00a0were on time and \u00a0were told that we would have to wait. And thats normal, no big deal. Only had to wait another 5-10 minutes or so. Dinner was amazing (will get to that in a bit). But the main issue was when staying for drinks afterwards. My friends and I were standing around the bar (second row from the bar) and after 20 minutes were asked to move away from the area we were in because \"we were blocking the servers\" (mind you we had been standing there for a while and had no issues and were being mindful our spacing). So we moved to the middle area of the bar and were quickly told that we couldn't stand there either because we \"cannot block the walkway\" (again, plenty of space for people to pass/walk). So we were told to stand by the downstairs entrance that had a single roped area (which was way more in the way of everything!- kitchen, entrance from upstairs, etc). And then in THAT area they told us we had to move. So we move our group to the center bar area again. This has now become officially ridiculous so when the same staff member was about to tell us for the \"second time to move\", I informed them that we had been paying customers during dinner and spent over $250, with then getting additional drinks (average price is $12) and proceeded to inform them that IF there is clearly no room to stand (by their standards), then STOP letting people in downstairs. We had been there for over 2 hours and were still paying customers and that we will not be moved again. At this point, the attitudes from the staff were showing, but seriously enough is enough. So my friends and I went to Sibling Rivalry's bar for more drinks (much better customer services)Positive note and something to remember: 4 stars: delicious, well-cooked food that is superb. restaurant week quality on an everyday basis. Had the Rack of Pork that was to die-for! and our waitress was attentive and friendly.

The food was DELICIOUS, we had oysters as an app, they were great, plump and meaty but not as grimy and coarse as some places serve them. Had the seared tuna which was delicious!

My second foray involved watered down gin and tonics and sickly sweet side cars. When it was suggested on the third time, I rolled my eyes, but gamely went ahead. Well, he was paying, it seemed only appropriate. And thank the big guy upstairs that I'm a money hungry ho, because this meal was fantastic! The duck and jalapeno risotto was one of those hallelujah moments for me. For a good 15 minutes, I virtually ignored both my date and my drink while I gazed lovingly at each forkful that approached my mouth. Luckily there was a pretty lady in a plunging red dress singing her heart out on stage to distract him. Our waitress was fantastic, anticipating all our needs, refilling both water and booze in a timely manner, and laughing when I ordered a carafe of wine and she brought two glasses. Ah no, he doesn't drink wine. That's all for me mamacita. Imagine our surprise when at the end of the meal she told us that she was technically still training and this was her first night \"alone\" on the floor. Kudos! Future ventures have shown that the short rib grilled cheese is a devilishly decadent delight, the sage frites are a perfect cocktail absorber, and the shrimp cocktail is the absolute in light bar snacking. But in truth, my heart still belongs to the duck risotto. Over the past year, I've seen the staff steadily improve, from the now smiling and gracious doormen to the competent and friendly wait staff. Even the cocktail quality has seen a much needed boost. The myriad of performers that come through here are both talented and interesting.

That said, I've been to the Beehive twice. The first time was a company party and we had the upstairs reserved for dinner. \u00a0They had a special menu planned for us. I split the appetizer options with a co-worker. The mixed-greens salad was very good. I'm not a salad person, but it was very fresh and flavorful. We also had fried calamari, which was very good with the homemade tartar sauce. My meal was a leg of chicken, served with mashed potatoes. The meat was so tender, I didn't even need a knife to pull it off the bone. The servings were big, and necessitated a doggie-bag. The cheesecake dessert was also big, I'd say two servings-worth. Very rich, \u00a0but I have to say, a little disappointing. They only had a few beers to choose from, which was too bad. *EDIT* They added more, but are overpriced for what you're getting. Many beers are only offered in 12 or 20 oz. - Why not pints? Overall, a good experience, though we left before the music began. I recommend sitting downstairs for the music, unless you can get a table right near the balcony. My table was closer to the door - we couldn't see or hear the band and got draft and noise from the entrance. My second experience was downstairs for a college alumni dinner. The atmosphere is much different. Much more of a buzz, pardon the pun. The artwork is more prevalent, lighting much more intimate. I had the bone-in pork chop, which was HUGE. It was served with a gravy-sauce with fries and was just awesome. One of those meals that you just want to keep eating, well after you've realized your gut can't handle it . Our server was a witty friendly guy, who fit well with the atmosphere and the crowd they cater to. The artwork is interesting and for sale. Though, I don't have much need for a 3ft by 5ft painting of the word \"plenty\" in block letters. Especially since it costs $7,500. There is artwork everywhere except the men's room. The men's room has graffiti, mostly in the form of intellectual or philosophical quotes. \u00a0I sort of expected a more creative urinal, but I guess that's a bit much to ask.

Have nothing but great things to say about the Beehive.The night...Valentine's Day....the mission...impossible. In Boston for the weekend with my sister, her husband, our cousin, her boyfriend...with me as the fifth wheel. Our intention was to hit Toro, a great Tapas place. When we got there, the bar was packed like the L train at 6 p.m. Nowhere to move. No room ro breathe. Nuts. Now add to this group yet another couple that our cousin's boyfriend added and we're really not sitting pretty. Party of 7!? On Valentine's Day? Three and a half hour wait. We're F-d. \u00a0We take a hike and after a bit of a walk, we end up at the Beehive.As we approach the entrance there is a doorman, but he's got a smile on his face and looks convivial rather than off-putting. \"You guys here for dinner or drinks?\" He asks. We say, \"Well, we'd like to eat, but we'll settle for drinks while we figure it out.\" He smiles and opens the door, \"Put your name on the wait-list and head down to the basement.\" So we do. We put our party on the wait-list as it's Valentine's Day and the place is, like many others, SAH-Lammed. Downstairs we go.The joint is jumpin' and the vibe is right up my alley. Local artists are featured on the raw brick walls. The light is dim and everything is glowing from the twinkling incandescent bulbs in the chandeliers. With brick, exposed pipework and supports, the theme is very SoHo chic (despite being in Boston). Our party of seven managed to get close enough to the bar to order and this is when the place really started to get great.Despite how busy the place was, the entire staff seemed to be thoroughly bubbly with positive energy. Smiles and service all around. In New York at the same kind of place I could imagine bartenders barking out demands for drink orders and waiters rolling eyes at customers who take too long to order their food. Not at the Beehive. Everyone was a class act ALL NIGHT.The cute brunette bartender with a big red heart on her t-shirt smiled at me and said, \"What can I get you?\" I ordered two drinks off of the house cocktail list, a couple of beers and then chanced a special request. \"Can I get a classic Old Fashioned with just Michters Rye, a touch of simple syrup and a dash of bitters?\" She nodded and then said, \"So, no orange, no cherry no soda?\" I smiled and nodded aggressively. \"That's right.\" She went to work while saying, \"No problem.\" Nice.It was right about now that the host found our party and said, \"You guys are the luckiest seven people in Boston tonight. A party of seven JUST cancelled. Follow me.\" Wow. The Valentine's Gods were clearly with us. We scored a huge corner table, sat down, and poured over the menu. Our waiter, who looked exactly like David Mamet in Woody Allen glasses, came over and gave us the specials. We ordered a few carafes of wine to get dinner moving.The food. Very good. After a mis-step with the French Onion soup, things improved. (The FOS seemed to have had a tomato broth added and the consistency was so thick as to be almost \"saucy\". Not great.) But after that one little trip, everything was great. I split a Chateau Brion with a friend and the meat was tender, tasty, and amazing. Blackened spices on the outside and deep red soft goodness on the inside. The twice baked potato side was to die for. My friend had a pasta with five different kinds of mushrooms that was blissful. My cousin and her boyfriend shared a Paella that featured huge chunks of lobster, scallops, shrimp, and other assorted seafood with rice in a gorgeous cream sauce. Everything was so good.After dinner, we could hear live music beginning to play. We abandoned our table as it was now surrounded with standing bar-goers. After midnight, the dining room began to evolve into a jumbo hang-out. Our party motivated toward the stage, where a woman in her fifties crooned great soul-love songs. Now here is where Beehive really earned the stars and shot themselves to the top of my \"LOVE\" list. A few of the people in my party, me included I'm embarrassed to say, became a little \"picky\" about their drinks after having had several of them. As we moved from our dining table to our \"cocktail\" tables closer to the live music, we got a new waitress. She was all smiles, energetic, and very very cool. Long story short, we were a little tipsy and probably a bit more labor intensive than some of the other groups. Our waitress didn't bat an eyelash. She was friendly, kind, enthusiastic and her motto was clearly, \"Whatever it takes to make you guys happy. No problem!\" It was genuinely awesome...and I drunkenly told her so several times. When we finally migrated up into the cold Boston night, we had an instant pow-wow in which we all concluded the same thing...\"The BEEHIVE IS AMAZING and we want to go back ALL THE TIME.\"", "Date": "2010-02-18", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Elsie F.", "ReviewID": "ErbU6pSAJcmN9Yixu_xR2g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice brunch spot.

When you end up taking the trip to Boston's South End to visit the Beehive, be sure to remember this: if you are going there to have dinner, it isn't really a restaurant, so you will be let down; ditto with drinks - they are not marketed to people with shallow pockets, with pints of beer running as much as $8 a pop. What the Beehive has in spades, however, is atmosphere. From the dim ambience of the downstairs dining room and bar, to the top-notch quality jazz that is played there each night, the Beehive is a much better place than either its markups, or its menu, would suggest.It would be a stretch to describe the menu at the Beehive as \"adventurous.\" While it's true that the menu frequently changes, the majority of the main courses on the menu, though competently prepared with quality ingredients, consist of variations on a theme of \"standard bar fare.\" The occasional spice-crusted seared ahi tuna salad or a dish with lamb, couscous, and arugula will rear its head, but for the majority of the time it will be sandwiches, burgers, pasta, and salads. Mind you, none of the selections are appallingly bad; just don't expect to be completely blown out of orbit by the Beehive Burger.On the drink end of the spectrum, the Beehive offers a variety of draft and bottled beers (I believe the selection changes on a weekly basis). The drafts can range anywhere from $5 to $8, depending on how rapidly you want to get drunk. The bottled fare is cheaper, but not considerably so, ranging from $5 to $7 per offering. Wine and cocktails, then, are the mainstay of the Beehive's bar, and that's where the situation becomes tricky: while the bartenders at the Beehive are competent and have even been profiled in the Improper Bostonian for their signature drinks, none of them have aroused my taste buds enough to make me want to go back for seconds. On top of that, they are prohibitively expensive (nearly $11 a pop) - which marks them less than favorably when compared to the classier, more straight-forward drinks at bars like Teatro. Again, the same problem persists as with the menu: there isn't anything particularly wrong with any of the bar offerings at the Beehive, but very little of it is inspiring.At this point in the review, you are probably wondering what caused me to rate the Beehive so highly. After all, the cocktails, wines, and beers are either expensive or not particularly interesting, and the same thing can be said about the food menu. While that's technically all true, what works in Beehive's favor is the combination of the ambience, the regular crowd, and the relaxed, almost SoHo feel of the area. The fact that the Beehive is located in the dead center of Boston's South End is as attractive to the clientele as it is to the owners, and the space doesn't just pretend to have an artsy vibe around it - it actively generates it. The dim lights, the use of space in the downstairs dining room, the exposed brick walls showcasing local artwork - all of this feeds into a very relaxing, positive vibe. Additionally, the Beehive hosts a veritable smorgasboard of local, regional, and national jazz acts, the majority of which possess incredible chops. It is for this reason that the Beehive is highly recommended to those who are in the mood to just kick back after a tough week at work: it's not that you won't care that the food and drinks aren't spectacular what between the ambience, the music, and the location.

I called ahead and was greeted by a friendly hostess who informed me they had a special Irish menu until late and a regular menu as well. So we were already off to a good start. I arrived and walked right in-there were no lines, which I'll chalk up to this being a non-Irish bar/restaurant on St. Patricks. I asked for a nice table and got a very cool seat perched overlooking the stage on the second floor. Absolutely perfect.The band was authentic and quite good and the music was just the right volume. The waiter was pretty prompt and helpful and there were no snags in the service department. I opted for a simple hamburger and fries and was surprised when they did something I haven't seen in a while-they cooked a burger well without drying it out of burning it. Oddly it was the messiest flakiest bun I've even had on a hamburger in my life-it wasn't stale, just flaked like crazy. The fries, or frites as I believe they call them, were pretty darn good and original. So I enjoyed my somewhat overpriced hamburger and \"frites\" and had a Guinness with the meal. Things went so well I decided to delay heading to my final destination and stick around for a drink at the bar-that was my mistake.So I headed downstairs to have another pint and was greeted by the worst bartender(s) I've encountered in some time. Now keep in mind the bar was fairly uncrowded-in fact I was able to get a seat at the bar. Everyone sorta wandered around behind the bar doing their thing with a \u00a0look that says \"I hate my job\". The worst offender was the girl with way too much makeup on who finally took my order by just staring at me with a look of \"god I hate people\". I said I'd like a pint of Guinness and the girl slowly moved off and reached into a cooler and pulled out a can of Guinness! A can?? Your bar makes a big fuss about St. Patricks Day and your special menu, bands, etc and you don't make room on tap for a Guinness (or any other Irish stout for that manner)? Oh well...So she dumps the can in the glass plunks it front of me and wants $7.50 for my CAN of Guinness. Yikes, gouge much? Long story short- the bar staff here is awful and as someone who worked in bars for years I have no idea how they keep their jobs.

Sadly, it would be about an hour to seat our party of 5...however, the bar area was wide open, so we sat down on the stools and were greeted by 2 great bartenders who were in extremely positive good moods. This makes a big difference sometimes between a decent meal and a great meal.We were served free beignets because the bartender could tell this was our first time at brunch at the Beehive and he wanted us to experience them. Well done bartender, well done. The beignets were light and fluffy and sweet and very good. \u00a0Definitely order them if you go.The menu for brunch sadly did not have huevos rancheros, but did have a few items that sounded tasty. One dish was the \"Eggs Shakshuka\", which is an African dish that has a creamy tomato sauce over polenta with three baked eggs on top. Annie was the only one in our group to order this, but I think we all secretly wanted to. Mike and I ended up getting the Poutine and Abby and Sam got the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and ham respectively.None of us were disappointed with our meal. Everything was fantastic. The prices were a bit higher than I would have like by a dollar or two, but the service from the bartenders more than made up for it. I've been to Beehive before at night and while the music is good and the atmosphere fun, the waitstaff can be quite bitchy. We've had more than our fair share of run ins with waitresses giving us false prices on our drinks and forgetting to bring out drinks and treating us like crap.

What could be better than gravy smothered cheese frites, topped with runny eggs? And I am a big fan of Beehive's frites alone, so the dressed up version sounded amazing. But I should have known better - there really is nothing compared to the original Quebecois version; the Poutine was disappointing at best. The meat omelet of the day likewise sounded appealing - steak with horseradish ricotta, yum! Nope, no dice - the eggs needed salting. Never a good sign for a chef.The saving graces of the day? The bloody mary also really hit the spot. The rim of the glass was dusted with what tasted like Old Bay seasoning, which lended the perfect spice to the concoction. The yummy olive and peperoncini on top sealed the deal. The other saving grace was the Tomato and Farmhouse Cheddar Grilled Cheese. My husband could eat three of these, that's how much he loves it.

The venue itself to me seems a little oddly shaped - the floor you walk into is a balcony looking down to the main floor. The main floor has a large side room of tables, another room where the stage and more tables are located, and then a little cul de sac that runs up past the stage. Despite the compartamentatlization, rather than seeming cramped it actually made the place intimate. There were corners you could tuck away in and get to know somebody. Or others you could hide in.I couldn't really figure out where the 'dance floor' was, and I don't think I was alone. Some people danced up by the stage (great band btw), some at the back of the stage room, some at the adjacent dining room.I had a great time at the place, and will definitely be coming back.

I have been wanting to try this place for a while but for some unknown reason never seemed to make it, boy, was I missing out!! The place is deceptively large (given all the seating is downstairs) but be prepared for a wait if you want a table, like, a 45 minute wait around 8pm on a Monday night. That just goes to show how awesome this place is. Their drinks are incredibly delicious and well made (Shout out to the two bartenders (one male one female) working on Monday 6/24, you guys are fantastic! Sorry about not catching your names) and run about $10-12 for a cocktail. My friend and I sat at the bar for a while and started getting pretty hungry so we checked on how long it would be for a table and the timing didn't seem to move, so the bartender told us we could sit upstairs and order appetizers while we waited, which was awesome because we ended up having awesome seats to see the incredible French musicians playing downstairs. Now, the bartender did warn us that service would be a bit slow since it technically isn't where they serve food, but whatever, it was crazy packed and we weren't in any kind of rush. The food was great, my friend got the burger ($16) (which looked amazing with huge steak fries) and I got the special which was a smoked trout cake in tahini-esq dill sauce over a sliced cucumber salad ($12) which was really good and we shared the mussels appetizer ($15), which was great! The place is a bit pricey, but the food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, especially with the live music, and the drinks are strong and well made, so really, it's worth the money. Not to mention, at least with the bartenders we had, the service was actually friendly, maybe a tad slow, but I will take someone who smiles and talks to you over someone who doesn't give a sh*t (aka a lot of places in Boston I have been to) any day of the week!

So we waited about 20 minutes, went downstairs, and saw at least 4 empty tables. We sat down at one and within 5 minutes were berated for sitting at the wrong type of table (I guess we had to be seated by the hostess). After the hostess repeated \"EVERYONE HAS TO ORDER AN ENTREE\" a couple of times, our waiter came over and take our order. There were four of us, we ordered: 3 entrees, 3 appetizers, and drinks (at least financially equal to everyone ordering an entree). The waiter was so rude and repeated, \"So not everyone is ordering an entree?\" before agreeing to put in our order.

Everything from the food to the atmosphere to our waiter Billy (I think that's what his name was) was absolutely wonderful.We made reservations for dinner although when we got there, the place was pretty empty but it definitely filled in as the night went on and I'm guessing their regular Sunday \"Soul Night\" performance had something to do with that.

The food and drinks...to revert back to being five years old again for a moment, let me just say yummy in my tummy. My date had a drink that wasn't on the menu but our waiter was cool enough to ask them to make it anyways which was pretty sweet. Can't remember what I had to drink (I had a few) but it was bubbly and delicious and obviously kept me coming back for more. In terms of food, I had the arroz con pollo which was basically a pan of a half breast of chicken and delicious rice underneath. Soooo good. The chicken was moist and tender and had just the right bite to it and I had to refrain myself from just picking it up and eating it off the bone. Don't think I didn't consider it though, but I am a lady after all (all evidence to the contrary.) My date had the chicken fried steak which came with mashed potatoes, both of which were damn tasty when I of course snuck a bite when he wasn't looking. And then came dessert. Humina, humina. It was chocolate mousse with whipped cream and some caramel pretzel thingy (and no, that's not how it's listed on the menu) but for how good that was, they could have called it whatever they wanted to.

I'll start with the evening (bad) one:Having already had a couple of mediocre experiences at The Beehive, I went on a Tuesday night at 9pm to hear a group I love in a genre that pretty much no one else in the world is familiar with. Accordingly, the place was about 25% full (and after all, it was a Tuesday night at 9). Since no one was using any of the tables I sat down right in front of the bandstand. A hostess rushed over to me and asked if I would be eating dinner. I said no, I'm only here for the band, I'll be having drinks. Her response was: \"What SOME people don't underSTAND is that this is a restaurant, not a music club, so if you're not eating dinner you can't sit here.\" I get the principle, but the place was empty, so why not let me enjoy? Also, if they're not going to appreciate the business they generate through the bands they bring, why advertise who's going to be playing? I was extremely put-off. I've gotten attitude plenty of times there when I've gone at night, so beware if you're not in the mood to get snipped at.All that being said, I love their brunch. I've been thrilled with everything I've ordered, and so has everyone I've gone with. Eggs Shakshuka is awesome. The spinach and egg flatbread is also surprisingly delicious.

Food was okay, but the atmosphere more than made up for it. We were seated right near the stage and the Boston Horns were performing. The place got really packed at around 10:30 to 11:00pm. There are two bars one upstairs and one downstairs next to the stage. Its best to reserve a table 30 minutes before the band plays if you are planning to have dinner. Food: Started with the pierogies which were good. Comes with a small salad and four pierogies which was a perfect app for two. Crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside paired with caramelized onions and sour cream heightened the dish. After reading reviews I was excited to try the duck risotto but to my dissappointment they did not have it on the menu. So I chose the Moroccan couscous which was such a disappointment. It came with stewed vegetables with lamb and chicken (and sausage which was a surprise since there was no mention of it on the menu) over couscous. The couscous was bland but you are supposed to pour this broth over the whole dish which did not really do much to make the dish better. Yes the lamb and chicken were very tender, but overall the dish was kind of bland. She had the burger with gorgonzola and bacon, side of frites and coleslaw. The frites were the best thing I had for dinner. Never seen a place cut frites this way before, was sort of thin and crispy like a potato chip but had some texture to it. The burger was good and can't go wrong with gorgonzola and bacon with it. Coleslaw had no place being in the dish. . .kind of reminded me of the same coleslaw from kfc.Atmosphere: This is where \"The Beehive\" excels. Place felt like being in a cafe/bistro in Paris with all the small two tops. Kind of an old building but the way they arranged the place was well thought out.

all big positives.the first time i went we had a good time but it was later at night, and although there was some confusion when we tried to get a table, we were ultimately able to get one with no problem.the second time we went it was earlier at night and it seemed really disorganized (3 different people didn't know how to check the balance on my gift card) and strangely rigid about their rules since it was before ten o'clock, at which point you can apparently sit wherever, but not really. depending on who you ask, you can either sit at a table for drinks, \"oh wait you can't -

like they had grilled pieces of bread with cheese and an old stop & shop genetically engineered tomato and slapped them together before putting them on my plate. it was also super greasy, and the one PAPER napkin each person had at the table (!???!!) was not helpful at all. for $10 it does not come with any fries, so you have to order those on the side. they are not even fries exactly - more like thick, greasy chips. those were decent. the flatbread appetizer was all right - i mean who can eff up flat bread pizza?my beehive julep was smaller than it was this past summer, but also cheaper i think ($10 and not $12). service still left something to be desired. we had to flag down our waiter for evvverrryyythinnng.despite not being thrilled i think this is a good place to take visitors. the decor is impressive and you can make a reservation if you're eating too. i just wouldn't come here again on my own i don't think unless it was for drinks.", "Date": "2007-08-14", "Author_Location": "Cambridge, MA"}, {"Author": "Michael G.", "ReviewID": "TowK0xm1PRh0hGBZKgiPrA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came for the Jazz, stayed for everything else.

Instead, I was treated to a beefy, juicy and downright pleasing hamburger and fries combination, with attentive servers.

But what can you do, I enjoyed my burger through and through, chatting with the passionate Gary from PigTrip for hours, about all things burgers and BBQ. They call it The Prime Burger, but I'm not sure if it's actually made from Prime Beef or not, but it is beefy, and clearly not your run of the mill chuck or sirloin. It's juicy from beginning to end, with a nice crust and a modest char, nothing overpowering but everything complementary. The fries, cleverly thinly cut lengthwise like a chip, but curvy, make for an excellent dipping vessel for the ketchup. \u00a0They are seasoned to perfection and downright addictive. Slightly bland coleslaw rounds out the plate, a good option to have but certainly not the star of the show. The price of cheese makes this a $15 burger, which is fine, and mostly justified. While I still long for the lost art of the $10 burger like the one's at Highland Kitchen or Miracle of Science, sometimes you just have to pay for location.

Pure fire! OK, the crowd is eclectic. I was made a bit uncomfortable by a gay man who kept staring at me, but I changed my field of vision and was just fine after that.

If we were any closer to the music, it probably would have been a little too loud for any conversations.A bunch of us ordered some ginger beers (non-alcoholic) and they were awesome! Service was pretty cordial and things came out at a great pace. The food was really good but it was not always perfect. For apps, we got the ribs and calamari. There was a consensus that it was way under-seasoned and not spicy (despite that it came with jalapenos mixed in). It was very lightly battered but the texture of the squid itself was probably the most tender I have ever had. The pomodoro and aioli sauce were almost flavorless, which made it probably the least flavorful dish of the night. However, the portion on it was pretty great. It was not horrible but it wasn't amazing (Calamari 2.5/5). The ribs were beautifully stacked and glistening. I think it had 5 pieces, some on the bone and some weren't. It was more successful flavor wise with a crisp and charred sweetness. The scallions on top were refreshing. The meat was tender but a bit too dry for me at times. (Ribs 4/5)For the entrees we ordered, they all visually looked pretty darn good and well portioned. I can speak to some elements as I got a little taste from everyone at my table but I have to say I didn't get the full experience of my friends's dishes. The best looking one of the night was definitely the chicken and lamb Moroccan couscous. It came in this big deep set metal dish with some sauce on the side. The sausages were really good and very different in flavor than anything I've ever tasted. The chicken was pretty tender and the couscous was fluffy. The duck dish was really really good. It was perfectly cooked with it being pink (not raw) in the middle, I think my friend asked for it to be medium rare. The meat was tender, lean, and dense. It was pretty great! The sauce accompanying it was light but perfect. It was probably one of the most balanced dishes we had. The roasted salmon on the bed of rice looked pretty good too. I tried a piece of the salmon and it was tender and moist. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dish with no complaints.My own dish was the lemon sole and it was a good portion with two fillets that were crusted and crispy. It was a very delicate and subtle tasting fish paired with rich risotto that also had some whole mussel meat mixed it. I wished the fish crust were a bit crispier but at least it wasn't dry. The lemon flavor was quite subtle, I almost don't remember it. This particular variety of risotto was pretty tasty and flavorful but the texture was more rough (not hard). And I wished the sauce was just a bit more creamier and viscous, not so thick. The only really bad thing is that one mussel had a lot of sand and I really did not enjoy that part, chewing sand. And then another one had some sand in it too. If it weren't for that, it would have been 4/5 dish. I almost can't rate the dish because of the sand, and I shouldn't expect that for any amount of money I pay for food. But I didn't bother telling the waitress, I was just there to enjoy what I did have.But for the dessert, it was spectacular! We had the bread pudding with the syrup and ice cream on top. The pudding was not piping hot but pretty warm and the ice cream with it was just heaven together. And the edges were amazingly crispy. The size was slightly small looking but it was just enough for the 4 of us to eat especially already being so full.As the night went on, it got pretty busy and bustling probably around 7:30. I can't remember exactly when because I lost track of time. I was so enveloped in this space. It felt kind of magical with the live music and active conversations going on. The atmosphere is really what you are paying for and I would say worth more than the money if you let yourself enjoy the moment.

I was impressed with the decor, drinks, and music (the atmosphere is truly beautiful), but soon grew tired of being scolded for not \"standing in the right place\". It seemed that the staff was very protective of their seated dinner patrons, so I thought we'd try the place again for dinner. I made 9:30 reservations for a party of 7, and got a very nice call from the Beehive the day of to confirm. When we arrived, we narrowly made it in, since the super intense hostess \"could not find us on her list\". Please calm down. We are in Boston, not the West Village. After that fiasco, we were asked to wait at the bar until our table was ready. We certainly did not expect to be standing at the bar for an hour, but that is exactly what happened. Even worse, the staff blamed the delay on other patrons, whining about how they had been giving \"the people sitting at our table the death look\", but that nobody was budging, so we would just have to wait. Instead of being apologetic, or offering to make some other arrangements for us, everyone was just standing there with their hands in the air, acting like they had no idea what to do. The maitre d' told us that \"never in his life had he seen something like this happen\". I'm sorry, but I have to call bullshit.

If you are going to have to rush another party to have us sit down, then you should not be misleading me into thinking that 9:30 means 9:30.At 11:30 we finally got our hilariously overpriced food.

Seating was very tight. One had the server station and another had a chimney against his seat. Seats are pretty uncomfortable although they make you practice good posture. Unfortunately we were unable to get much of a view of the trio playing and the noise level was such that we couldn't hear what they were playing anyway. The food was very good. Apps: Ceviche was nice but a little under seasoned. The Moroccan cigars were great as was the Antipasto. Entrees included the Moroccan Couscous with lamb - very good but again a little under seasoned. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked with a flavorful rice. Chicken picatta got a rave review and my grilled short rib and cheese was very good and huge! A round of cocktails were well done.
