I spent a few days before going over reviews, drooling over pictures, and making a game plan for the day. HahaWELL....it was the most disappointing dinner ever!!! :-(First, service was great. I ordered a Sangria flight and I loved the variety and WOW was it strong! I usually only like white sangria but I was surprised how great the rose & red sangria tasted. If you are not sure what sangria to get I recommend their flight. They also have a great wine flight. Their cocktail drinks are also great...which is a plus!Dessert was probably our favorite part of the night. We ordered xocolate y avellana. It had a lot of different flavor going on, but the bits of saltiness made it good.Unfortunately, our food was not good. Patatas Bravas: Looks great....but Small portion and there was something weird about the Aioli. The potato was good but the sauce was not.Setas de Horno: I love mushrooms. I just didn't like the texture of these mushrooms...very rubbery. I think they were over-cooked. Plus this dish was very very salty.Oxtail Ravioli: VERY VERY small portion 3 Raviolis for $16, but it was probably the most decent tasting tapas of all.Pork belly: Horrible. Waste of money because most of it was left on the plate. In one word it tasted \"dirty\".Tortilla Espanola: another major disappointment. I think they worry about presentation on this one and forgot flavor. We ordered another tapas but I just can't remember much about it...On a side note, the main room in on the 2nd floor and is very opened so it was a little loud but you can still hear your table. Unfortunately, the bathroom is downstairs and it is a very creepy dark bathroom. The bill does not equal the quality of the food and it was a waste since food was basically left on the plates after a few bites. Everything looks so good on the menu and I love trying new things...presentations were great but the food just was blahhh. \u00a0It was one of those nights were you didn't really drink a lot but left drunk because you didn't really eat anything.", "Date": "2014-07-13", "Author_Location": "La Grange, IL"}, {"Author": "Araba O.", "ReviewID": "tdVO1Fbo3JYb32U2w5_ghw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say that our overall experience at Mercat was excellent (despite a little hiccup in the beginning).We planned to have a large party dinner at Mercat as the last night of our family reunion a couple of weeks in advance . Not only was I excited about the menu, but knew that it would be a great experience for a few members of the family who would not otherwise have Spanish cuisine or the seek the variety that tapas offers.The skinny on the hiccup has to do with the reservation and accommodations not being what was previously discussed, arranged or confirmed, but Casey quickly made sure that everything was set right and we had a wonderful time! During the reservation process we were told that the family reunion name could be printed on the menus- Casey came through with that and it was a great little keep-sake as well. For all of that, I could not give less that 5 stars- it was a pleasure dining there!From Casey (extremely nice, intuitively accommodating and professional restaurant manager- a true rock star!), Naomi (our amazing, knowledgable and humorous coordinating waitress- our guide on the tapas trip!), to the additional serving staff and the hostess, we were quickly made to understand that they would care for us and do so well. Casey and Naomi put us at ease and allowed us to trust in the dining experience. SOO happy we did!The food was delicious. I mean- REALLY delicious. We had the La Mesa De Jose Tasting Menu and were pleasantly met with top fresh ingredients, spices and flavors for each and every item. It was a absolute treat. \u00a0In our party we had a couple of vegetarians and pescatarians- easily accommodated with individual adjustments in the menu. Some of the favorites still being talked about days later: Pimientos De Padron, Gambas Al Ajillo, Verdosa (that salad will give you pause- just wow), Pelotas, Veneras and the Ribeye. The desert was the PERFECT closer: Croquetas de Xocolata. A member of the family may or may not have foraged for these on the other end of the table because there were being \"consumed too slowly\". Unconfirmed.The table wine and cocktails well matched the food. The accommodations exceeded our expectations as we had planned to be on the main dining floor. Naomi even brought in a couple of small speakers so that we could enjoy the music during our dinner (a couple of elders hinted they may be moved to even get up and samba!).Cheers and thank you to Mercat for adjusting and hosting us for this pleasurable dinner. The staff is top notch. I highly recommend you go and explore the variety of tapas offered- it's a delight.

Yet, my husband and I found the whole experience to be, on the whole, rather disappointing.The menu is long and a little overwhelming. Lots of things looked tasty, but we were torn between choosing our own selections and going with one of the tasting menus. We asked our waiter, Jerry, about the difference between the standard and \"luxury\" chef's menus and were told that the luxury version featured more \"exotic\" selections. I wasn't sold, but my husband, riding high on a recent dinner during which we had (and loved) beef tongue and frog legs, wanted the more adventurous option. So, we went for it, even though I was nervous about flying blind.Our meal started with the bacon-wrapped dates, which were warm and salty and sweet. and helped get the meal off on the right foot. It was followed by the Serrano ham, Cadi Urgelia (cow's milk cheese with a bacon caramel and thin green apple slices), and a tricolor quinoa salad with pine nuts, raisins, and a lemon yogurt sauce - all very good. Before we received our first course, I ordered the Menta Cidro (Grey Goose Citron, St. Germain, mint, fresh citrus, and soda) - it was fantastic, but I pretty much fall in love with anything that has St. Germain in it. I finished it by the end of the this round of dishes, but Jerry never asked me if I wanted another, or followed up with me about any of the wines. The empty glass sat on our table until right before the check came. Next up, we had some flash-fried peppers (eh), oxtail ravioli with aged manchego in a tempranillo reduction (delicious sauce - one of my favorite bites), grilled baby octopus (surprisingly tender), a flatbread with more Serrano ham, some microgreens, tomato slices, and cheese (good - my husband liked it more than I did). We were given the roasted cauliflower next, which we liked...and then came the proteins.The lamb chops and accompanying sauces were excellent - the meat was super tender and full of flavor. But the half lobster that was served with it was completely overcooked. I'm talking rubber lobster, to the point where we actually sent it back. Jerry apologized (insincerely - he looked at us like we didn't know what we were talking about) and ordered us up another lobster half. This one was inconsistent; in some places, the lobster was cooked fine and in others overcooked again. I have a hard time sending the same thing back twice, so we just picked at it trying to find the less rubbery parts.I should mention that in the middle of the meal I went to use the ladies room and it was a horror show. The room is dark, and by dark, I mean there are literally three small orange lights in the room, one by the sink and one in each stall. The walls are painted black and you can barely see anything. One stall had water all over the floor and two rolls of toilet paper sitting in the water. The other stall's door wouldn't close; I had to force it shut. The sanitary trash can's lid was broken, the sink wouldn't drain, and even the woman who was using the facilities before me remarked, \"This is disgusting. Why is it so disgusting?\"So when the lobster incident occurred, and our waiter Jerry seemed so detached from the whole thing (almost annoyed), I started to feel soured on the experience. Even without the overcooked lobster, I definitely don't feel like I got my money's worth. When you pay that much for a nice dinner, you expect the whole package - great service, perfect ambiance, impeccable food. I've had that at other places with similar price tags, and just last night, I had that to the nth degree at a higher-quality restaurant with a much smaller price tag. When Jerry asked us about dessert, I mentioned the issues with the second lobster. He said, \"You should've told me. I could've done something about it.\" Well, we did tell you about it the first time, and you didn't do anything except give us another overcooked piece of shellfish. We asked for the check and left.If the dinner had cost even half of what we ended up paying (which, for the record, is the most amount of money I've ever spent on dinner for two), I might have been able to overlook the lackluster service, bad dish, and gross bathroom. But I didn't. I forked over a lot of cash for a meal that ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth. literally and figuratively.

Obviously, the happy place involves cheese.So I usually avoid ordering cheese plates at restaurants...not always, but I definitely think extra carefully about it. Mostly, because it's f*cking expensive, and I can go to one of my favorite cheese shops and pay significantly less for a larger portion of fancy cheesy goodness.At Mercat a la Planxa, they made the cheese board well worth my time. Each cheese selection is carefully paired with an accoutrement. Each cheese selection offers its own unique flavor combination. And my happy place? Came in the Monte Crudo paired with truffle lavender quince compote. I seriously wanted to pick up the ramekin and lick every last drop of it. As classy as I am, though...I merely pulled it over to my plate as the busser was taking the mostly empty (save my compote happy place) cheese platter...and then I used bread to swirl the remaining contents into my mouth. I have zero shame. The other cheese and accoutrements were tasty, but the truffle lavender quince? I want to Sinead O'Connor that shit and start singing to it. So the server recommended that we order 3 per person and that we order it all at once. We're not really the type to follow directions, apparently. While three of us waited for two others, we ordered bacon-wrapped dates and our server brought out the tomato bread (which was really good). We also placed an order for the paella, knowing it would take the longest. I'm pretty sure our server was super annoyed at us for not listening to her and for going out of order--basically our paella was going to come out before most of our food, which turned out to be a really good thing. While we were eating the paella, we ordered a few of the tapas, a cheese and charcuterie, and a salad. We did not order 3 per person. We didn't even order 2 per person.

The BF doesn't do seafood, so we went with the chicken and sausage option. OMG. This thing fed an army and tasted AMAZING. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The rice and seasonings were perfect. YUM. Mixto Croquetas - ham and chorizo thingies. Very delish. Patatas Bravas - if I told you they were just okay, would you believe me?Verdosa - this green salad was super refreshing and full of flavor. Queso Mixto - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Or just order 3 of the monte crudo. \u00a0I don't actually know what the other two cheeses were. The were not near the limelight.Charcuteria Mixto - It was okay. The mustard creme fraiche was quite tasty.DESSERTCroquetas de Xocolata - OMFG. I can't accurately describe how sweet and delish these little pots of gold sitting on marshmallow clouds were. Blueberry Creme Fraiche ice cream - tasted like blueberry cheesecakeCarmelized White Chocolate ice cream - my fave of the ice cream trioBlood Orange Cava sorbet - this was nice, but nothing to write home aboutI really wanted to give it 5 stars, but I just couldn't. The food was really delicious, but the service was really rushed. Our server was nice enough, but I feel like all of the items being brought out at one time is a waste. I can't imagine having ordered FIFTEEN dishes that all ended up on our TINY table at the same time. With five of us, crammed around a table that should only seat 3-4, we barely had room for the plates. It was a race to make room at the table. Additionally, I think that the 3 per person recommendation is off. I guess it depends on what you're ordering, but with a paella, we were good for 1 other tapas item each.", "Date": "2014-03-30", "Author_Location": "Downers Grove, IL"}, {"Author": "Cameron B.", "ReviewID": "ih-NAwaOSr-fDeHfqe5RQA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came here with a big group for brunch on a polar-vortex type of day in Feb.

I cultivated a true love for pan con tomate while in Barcelona so I was feeling like this was a good sign of what was to come.

They were out of one thing we wanted and our server had some trouble recommending something to replace it, but we figured it out. Then, inexplicably, our server took a turn from being decently friendly to not giving a crap about us anymore. He could not have been less interested in giving us an enjoyable experience. He obviously cared deeply for the two out-of-town ladies sitting next to us. They were being fawned over by not only our server but basically the entire male staff while Stuart and I are sitting right there feeling like outcasts. Let us in to your revery!

At Mercat they were incredibly bland and the seasoning on it tasted like flavorless seaweed. Not my favorite. For the meat dishes we ordered the 'mari y montanya' and a pork belly dish. The short ribs and scallops in the mari y montanya were to die for - absolutely worth it. Pork belly is usually my favorite, but the texture was not what I am used to. Instead of a crispy exterior the whole thing was soft and was more of a boiled texture. The flavor was great, though, so no complaints there.We washed everything down with a pitcher of rose sangria that was light and refreshing.

Needless to say, I must have had a pretty bad experience to start now.Right off the back, I will say this: the food was delicious and innovative, albeit over priced. My issue was NOT with the food but with the service.I arrived at this restaurant prior to 8 last night. It was busy but I was seated right away. Once seated it took several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge my presence. Eventually someone came over and offered me water. Waited some more. Then my waitress arrived. She was friendly enough so I didn't hold the wait against her. I ordered an iced tea and 3 tapas. And then I waited ......And waited........And waited ........After about 30 minutes, my first tapas came out. It was a clam dish and it was excellent. Unfortunately I didn't have anything to wash it down with because my server never once stopped by to check on me or offer a refill, even though she walked right by me several times. \u00a0So I waited ......And waited. And waited. As plates of delicious looking food whizzed by mean without stopping, for more than 30 minutes. At some point a random server literally tossed a bowl of olives on my table and almost ran. I called out to stop him and told him I hadn't ordered olives. He quickly said they were compliments of the chef and jetted off. So I waited.Finally, someone showed up with the 2nd of my 3 tapas. By then I'd stopped tracking the time. As I shoved the food in my mouth, starving, my waitress magically appeared. For the FIRST time ever she apologized for the wait. Blamed it on the kitchen. The same kitchen that had been cranking out orders for everybody else. Interestingly, STILL NO OFFER TO REFILL MY DRINK.Now here is what sent me over the edge. When the waitress came over, I promptly cancelled my order for the 3rd tapas. Given the wait, that should have been a CLEAR indication to the server that I was ready to get the hell out of there. But rather than applying good common sense, let alone good customer service, and bringing me my bill, the waitress disappeared AGAIN! And there I found myself waiting AGAIN. It took all my self control not to lose it.I spotted her as she came to service the table immediately in front of me and then started to walk off without even looking in my direction. I called out to her and requested my check, handing her my card at that time so that she would get the sense of urgency. She came over with the bill immediately after that and gave me another half hearted apology for the wait. I actually contemplated not leaving her a tip. I've never done that before. But I decided that the problem wasn't just her. I do believe that something went wrong in the kitchen that contributed to the delay. But that was no excuse for her poor service either. I left exactly 10%.In the end, I walked out of that place feeling like an outcast. That is not a good feeling. And I don't care how amazing the good is, if I don't feel wanted in an establishment, I'll never return. I will not pay money to be ignored or abused.To Management: there are many excellent restaurants to choose from in Chicago. Folks on this site consistently complain about your prices. One of the ways you can make them feel that the prices are worth it, is to make them feel like THEY are worth it.

We weren't disappointed. We got there early and they didn't have a table for us yet, so we took a seat at the bar. Both bartenders were very friendly and helpful with the menu. I had the sangria flight, because I couldn't decided. Hub had a gin and tonic with house infused gin and kumquats, which was hands down the drink winner of the night. It might be one of the best gin and tonics I've ever had. I enjoyed it so much that after I finished my sangria flight, I drank gin and tonics for the rest of the night. Hub had a couple of other cocktails as well but we both agreed that the gin and tonic was divine. After hanging out at the bar for a bit, they had a table ready for us. The dining space is really cool and comfy. We were seated in a little rounded booth. The tables are small and space is limited, but since it's tapas, you don't really need tons of room at the table and I didn't feel cramped at all. We knew going in that we wanted the restaurant week menu. It's a great set up. You get three courses of small plates and a dessert. Everything is perfect sized to be shared. The first thing that came to the table was complementary bruschetta. It was deliciously salty and acidic and a great way to start things off. Then there was a salad, with serano ham and figs. And one of my favorite things of the night, the bacon wrapped dates drizzled with fondue. I could eat a whole plate of them! They are the perfect little umami bite of sweet, salty, savory, and yummy. The second round of dishes included my second favorite thing of the night, which was a mushroom flatbread with manchego cheese. The flatbread was a perfect crispy texture and the nutty cheese really complemented the earthy mushrooms. We also had garlic shrimp with the second course that came out sizzling hot. They were garlicky and \u00a0really well prepared. The third round of dishes included lamb chops, prawns, and patatas bravas. All three dishes were really good. The lamb was cooked perfectly and had a tasty romesco sauce with it. I'm not sure I really needed a second shrimp/prawn course, but the prawns were really large, and very flavorful. The patatas were really good too...sort of reminded me of tater tots for grown ups. Now, I'm a dessert girl and honestly, I wasn't super excited about dessert based on the menu. However, when it came to the table and I took a bite, I found I didn't really want to have to share with my hubby anymore haha. The marshmallow was like the stuff in the jar but a thousand times better. and the little chocolate croquettes were a really fascinating texture with the crispy outside and gooey inside. All the flavors really worked together to make a very playful, but grown up dessert. I loved Mercat a la Planxa. Often times we try places and they're good, but with so many other amazing places in the city, it's always more tempting to try something new rather than return to a place we've been. But that said, we'll be going back to Mercat sometime very soon.

There was dessert included in the buffet but it was just a big display of the same items (boring cupcakes cookies and muffins). Also a joke. Most of the dishes were tasty and the bacon wrapped dates were prob my fave.

It was surprisingly empty (just 2-3 other tables), which we didn't mind. I guess unless the patio is open, it's hard to tell there's an awesome tapas restaurant in here from street level! I had heard good things about the brunch, although I didn't realize that the charcuterie/cheese buffet is only available on Sundays. No biggie, Saturday offers a \"Catalan Express\" menu which includes 1 appetizer, 1 main, and a iced tea or fountain drink for $18. Not bad.I had the Spanish omelette -- a classic tapas dish and a good gauge for any Spanish restaurant. It was cooked to perfection -- moist and flavourful eggs and potatoes with spices, with a crispy outer layer. I tried one of my DC's mushroom soup which was very rich and delicious too. Another DC had the jamon serrano over salad -- a very big portion but not the most exciting option (you could easily make the same dish at home). For the main, I had grilled sea bass with spring peas and red quinoa. Everything was very fresh and bursting with flavour, with nothing too overpowering. Service was a little scattered but not so much to distract from the amazing Catalan food. Location is great! 2 of my DC's said it was better than any restaurants they tried in Barcelona! Not sure I would go that far, but I would say the dishes seemed authentic and the quality was on par with some of the better restaurants I tried in Barcelona.

Recently, I threw frugality to the winds and paid a visit. Sorry to say I was disappointed -- the place just didn't deliver value commensurate with the prices.We ordered the $65 tasting menu so we could sample a variety of dishes. On the plus side, there was plenty of food. A few of the dishes we sampled were OK, but none really stood out, with the exception of bacon-wrapped dates, which were quite nicely done. Octopus was tasty enough, but a little tougher than it needed to be. A salami plate and a cheese plate were enjoyable. Prawns had a faint ammonia character (as happens all to often). A steak plate was flavorful, but very gristly. The vaunted spinach with currants & apple was much too salty. (Saltiness was in fact a theme, as can be the case at Spanish restaurants.) Patatas bravas was nicely presented, and tasted fine.Drinkwise, I had the wine pairing, and was underwhelmed by the quality (my suggestion: start with a glass of nice garnacha, then have a glass of tempranillo). There is a fairly comprehensive selection of Spanish wines by the bottle, but they seem a bit pricey -- based on my experience buying Spanish wine at retail, there ought to be a few decent bottles of garnacha and tempranillo in the mid-$30s, not the mid-$40s.Service was admirable in one respect: pacing -- our courses came in a timely fashion and we got out in time to make a show without rushing. The plate runners were courteous, but spoke so quickly that we couldn't really understand what they were presenting. The bussers were similarly courteous. The main server did a decent job of introducing us to the menu, but seemed rushed & brisk.The ambiance was not to my taste. We were fortunate to have a four-top table -- if we had been at one of the tiny two-tops, it would have been miserable trying to fit all the dishes on the table. The noise level was OK when we arrived, but built throughout our visit to the point where trying to converse was unpleasant by the time we left.The whole experience reinforced for me why I'm about done with hotel restaurants: overpriced, so-so food, unrelaxing ambiance, rushed service and an overall \"food factory\" feel.

This was a dramatisation PLEASE do NOT perform any of these acts to myself or others).

Gambas Al Ajillo -Garlic Shrimp. Arroz Can Morels -Morel Mushroom Bomba Rice, Green Asparagus & Lemon Oil. Cepes Y Butifarra -Porcini & Catalan Sausage, Roasted Garlic and Manchego. Patatas Bravas -Spicy Potatoes with Spicy Paprika Aioli. And for desert that has beaten ALL of my other desserts... EVER (Probably going to lose my man card again but this dessert made me close my eyes) Croquetas de Xocolata -Milk Chocolate Croquettes, Banana Marshmallow, Rosemary Carmel, Arbequina Olive Oil.

I recently ventured over to Mercat a la Planxa with 3 others for my birthday, so I knew I would have the opportunity to try a lot of food.FOOD:Tomato bread for the table: basically like pico de gallo on top of buttery bread. Delicious and light, only the ends of it seemed to be at all greasy. Great way to start. I loved this so much.Pulpo con patatas: I love mollusks, they taste delicious. This dish had a lot of paprika in it, with some acid from what I would assume is lemon juice, which together combined for great flavor. I don't know if the potatoes really added anything as the dish itself wasn't very strongly flavored, and not at all salty. However, the octopus was awesome, and would strongly recommend this to anyone.Bacon wrapped dates: My friend told me a few different time about these dates - I'm not sure if it was because she didn't remember telling me about them, or if she just loved them so much. Well, it was probably the latter because these things were my favorite dish of the night. It was a classic sweet + savory combination that worked so well. Get these.Truita de patata: I was surprised at how much I liked this dish - very creamy, well seasoned, and not a lot of saltiness. All good things. I'm glad Chef Garces went with a goat cheese for this one - the subtle and soft flavor went really well with the creamy lentils.Albondigas de venera (scallop and shrimp meatballs): Some might not agree with mushing up scallops and shrimp into ball form, but I think it was genius. I like meat balls, I like seafood, I like this dish. Like scallopballs (not to be confused with scallop testes) with chunks of shrimp in it, if that makes sense.Serrano ham and fig salad: an't go to a Spanish restaurant without getting some of that jamon, right? The jamon de Iberico de bellato (or something like that, basically Iberico pork-belly ham) was a bit much on el dinero side, but we got this ham and fig salad based on a recommendation from a friend. Very good, although I didn't taste much fig until I went digging around looking for it. Serrano ham was delicious, albeit extraordinarily salty. I guess I'm more used to the more subtle flavor of proscuitto.Pinxtos muranos (lamb brochettes wrapped in bacon): Well, this was good. But bacon wrapped anything is good. One point here is that I didn't get much of a lamb taste. I hope this wasn't due to being two pitchers of sangria deep, but I felt like the lamb was overpowered by the bacon + sauce. Sauce was sweet btw.Paella valenciana (chicken & chorizo paella w/artichoke and tomato salad): I love paella. I usually like rice dishes. Good flavors (chorizo in here was great), but the chicken was pretty bland on its own. Probably a good thing considering that my salt sensing 'buds were in overdrive. I prefer paella del mar (I think I can speak el espanol, I really can't though), and I actually prefer Cafe Babareeba's paella to this one. However, I (we) was (were) really full at this point, so maybe that impacted what I tasted.DESSERT: Croquettes de xocolate (chocolate and caramel filled croquettes): So good. Deep fried balls filled with chocolate and caramel? YEA GIMME. Shove one of these with the banana cream into your fat face and wait for a gush of awesomeness and sweetness. There were 6 croquettes and 4 of us, I decided to grab two. Someone else was smart enough to grab the last one.SERVICE: Fast, friendly, and very helpful with recommendations. They also weren't very intrusive, but were around whenever one of us needed a refill or we needed some more sangria. Our server was also very personable and just fun.VALUE/OVERALL:I think that for a tapas place owned by an Iron Chef, Mercat is a pretty good overall value.

Each dish has a wonderful taste and makes you wonder -- \"just what else did they add to this to make it soo darn good?!\"Seafood is important for Barcelona cuisine as it is at this restaurant. The grilled shrimp prawns were superb! Not doused in sauce, but spiced just right and laid right on the plate. The beef entrees are a real treat as well (although not truly a common Catalan staple, but they do it wonderfully). Fillets are cooked just like a great steakhouse.

I was up on North Michigan between work and dinner and I thought \"oh, I'll just walk down for dinner.\" Right. That's a long walk from Chicago Avenue. I ended up arriving wet from the rain, blistered from my shoes, hot, late, and frazzled. My friends were having drinks in the bar and I joined them for one before we headed up for dinner. Nothing like booze to calm the nerves.Mercat a la Planxa's bar is on the first floor, street level. The dining room is one floor up. I didn't realize beforehand that the restaurant is located in the Blackstone Hotel. The interior is really beautiful. Warm colors. Modern touches. I thought it was cool how the kitchen is wide open, making it almost part of the decor, a show of the process.Chef Jose Garces is the the owner of Mercat a la Planxa. I'd heard of him from the Food Network, where he won the Next Iron Chef challenge. Think what you like about the Food Network and it's challenges, but Chef Garces also won the James Beard Award for best mid-atlantic chef.Our waitress that night was a firecracker. And really good at her job. Funny, but not trying too hard. Friendly. And she knew her stuff too. She mentioned to us that Chef Jose Garces was in the kitchen. I commented that I was suprised, since he owns 6 restaurants in Philadelphia and only one in Chicago. Our waitress said Chef is in Chicago a lot and told us that he's from Chicago and attended Lane Tech and Kendall College.For dinner we decided to split 6 small plates and a pitcher of the seasonal sangria. We were first served tomato bread, which was so light and fresh and delicious. Next up we got the chef's selection of 3 cheeses. Each of these cheese were served with a special side. The goat cheese was paired with a garlic dulce de leche. The sheep cheese with a orange marmalade. The cow's milk cheese came with a pistachio truffle side. So good. The pairings were right on and just as delicious as the cheese itself.Next we had some delicious croquetas of potato and cheese with some jamon (ham) inside. We also had pimentos de padron, flash fried padron peppers with salbitxada and sea salt. The croquetas were very rich and salty, but in small little pops, were so good. My friend had a dish similar to the peppers somewhere in New York and ordered them to compare. She said the ones at Mercat were better than the ones she had in NY.We were loving this food so far. So it was no surprise, after eating this deliciousness, pondering over how local the Chef is and how much he's accomplished, we were forming little foodie crushes. We looked up and Chef Garces was standing next to our table talking to a few people. Someone at our table may have made some saucy gestures behind Chef's back and been really embarassed when our sassy waitress called her out. May have happened. Or may have just been a sangria daydream.. but it would be quite a coincidence then when we saw the waitress talk to Chef and then when he came over to our table to introduce himself. Blush blush blush!Ahem. Back to the food....It was coming out fast and furious at this point. We had the pinones con boquerones, which was a flatbread with white anchovies, pancetta, goat cheese and marinated pine nuts. We also had some slow-cooked pork belly with cider glaze, green apples and truffle. There was also a dish with mussels. All very very good.For dessert we had croquetes de xocolata - milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow, rosemary caramel and arbequina olive oil. OMG. These were so good. There were six little croquetes and I remember sitting and talking a bit before eating my first when my friend interrupted me and yelled to just eat it already because she had eaten hers and it was THAT good. My other friend was making a face while she ate hers. I couldn't tell if it was pain or pleasure. Turned out that's just how good they were. Make sure you get this dessert if you visit Mercat.The food at Mercat a la Planxa was really well done. Great dinner. And not too expensive. We were stuffed at the end and including the drinks, the bill was about $45/person.

But that's Mercat's weekly special for their Iron Chef Mondays, where they recreate all the dishes from an episode that Iron Chef Garces competed in.Well, after our dinner, I went home and pulled up the very episode our dinner was supposed to be based on - Battle Truffle. Now, I know truffle's expensive. I know that. But I noticed a few key differences between what we ate and what the judges ate:1) Much less truffle. Ok, some of the dishes on the show had piles of shaved truffle, and there's no way $35 could cover that. But maybe a couple slices at least?2) Straight-up substitutions. We got wild boar instead of veal, and there were places where the IC used some truffle variation of an ingredient that we didn't get.3) Again, I know it was just $35...but the portions were really disappointing. With 4 of us, we had to split either one or two of the sizes that the judges got. Trying to split one egg and four small pieces of steak four ways is both simple and sad.

We went here for late dinner on a snowy evening expecting to be blown away by some good Catalan food. It turned out to be one of the most disappointing dining experiences we've had in a long time. The ambiance: The restaurant is on the first floor and looks like it used to be a club or something. The seating area is in a 'pit' that probably was a dance floor. Everything was too dark and sort of loud for a 'fine dining' restaurant. The tables were too small and too close together. We were easily within a foot of the people sitting next to us and it was uncomfortable to say the least. The Service: Decent enough. Although they brought out everything we ordered at the same time. Which is unacceptable at anytime but especially so because of their lilliputian tables. We spent most of the evening maneuvering our arms and hands around plates and glasses just so we could eat without knocking something over (and probably into the laps of the people next to us). The food: Terrible. Everything was cold. Nothing lived up to expectations. We got a charred green onion dish and it turned out to be something one can make at a campfire. Take a bunch of scallions drowned in olive oil and throw 'em over a fire. Although then you wouldn't have the pleasure of paying 8 bucks for it. We couldn't eat it and had to send it back (but they did not take it off our check). The raw cow's milk cheese wasn't very good either and came with a strange assortment of lavender jam (which tasted like everything but lavender) and sliced stale baguette and apples..not sure how one eats apples, cheese, bread and jam together. The only decent dish was the confit tomatoes and roasted cipollini onions. \u00a0( I dont think its important enough for me to look up the actual names of dishes since they all sucked anyway)The drinks: Simply crap. $10 bucks for a 'caliente' which was supposed to be mango nectar and orange liqueur and soda water and chilli powder. The drink had no taste of its own - the only thing I could taste was the alcohol. The Sangria wasn't great either - had too much ice which diluted it further. They either don't have a dedicated bartender or the bartender they have should be a janitor because he/she definitely can't mix drinks. All in all a mediocre (at best) dining experience at an exorbitant price. This place is an insult to Spanish food, hell - to food in general, to bartenders and more importantly to my taste buds.

The decor was sophisticated and plush with warm glowy lighting that makes everything look lovely. Ceilings are way up there and the main floor is open and airy. When we initially checked in with the hostess, she told us there weren't any tables until 10 and to try the lower lounge. Did that, and the next thing we know, we were being escorted via elevator to the 3rd dining area. It was less glitzy, more secluded with mellow brazillian tunes piped in. It would be the perfect area to dine with kids, but we were satisfied just to get in on such a busy saturday night.While we were waiting on our mojitos to be delivered, the customer service got even better. We were asked if we wanted the best seat in the house--a quaint little spot in the other dining room overlooking the main floor. We took a look and made the move. Stellar!

The prices for these were on the high side but we were willing to splurge hoping it was going to be worth it and unfortunately it was not. Out of the 7 plates we ordered, all but two met my expectations. The seafood croquettes and verdona salad was exceptional, the rest was abysmal. The skirt steak was served rare--almost raw. We expected our waiter to give us the option of how we wanted our meats but didn't care to ask. The arroz congraje was way too salty and I am a person that normally overseasons my meals but this just tasted like I was shoving salt in my mouth. The quail with foie de gras looked better than it actually tasted. The patatas bravas was just smokey and bland. The specialty drinks was extra sweet that by the time we were to the last few sips it was all sugar.The dessert was even more disappointing. I love desserts and practically eat anything with chocolate but the fried chocolates was just too much for me.. It was way to sweet, it tasted like fried sugar. We also tried the Helados (sorbet) and this was okay but not great. I probably would have gotten better quality sorbet from the gelataria at the corner of my place. Anyway, you got the point the food just did not cut it.The service was also pretty bad. We went on a Sat. night and there were only two waiters that were taking orders for all the tables, granted there were a ton of people walking around bringing the plates to the tables but they all had a set task. After the waiter took our order, we did not see him until almost 2 hours later. We wanted to add an additional plate but by the time he came around we just gave up. At one point, our table was full of empty plates that the people that were bringing the plates didnt care to take them (presuming I guess this wasn't their job) and just kept on moving them on the table so they can make room for the new plate.At the end of the night, we ended up with an exorbitant bill and a stomach ache. Although, the actual experience at the restaurant was not the worst part. Let's just say Mercat also stays with you the next day. Well, depending on how you see it.

We were able to arrange breakfast deliveries to our hotel room. Being woken up by Mercat's Blackstone Eggs Benedict was like heaven. The meal consisted of tender chorizo and perfectly poached eggs in a savory, creamy sauce. The toasted brioche soaked up all the deliciousness. The crispy breakfast potatoes were fabulous too. This was one of the best, if not the best eggs benedict dish I have had.For my 3rd Mercat breakfast, this time at the actual, beautifully-decorated restaurant, I decided to try something different.: steak and poached eggs (s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026). The steak was definitely tasty though it could have used some sauce or extra flavor to give it some oomph. I thought it was weird that they didn't have steak sauce. They ran out of biscuits, so I had the delicious brioche again. The sauce for this dish was again, absolutely delicious. The eggs were great except there was a bland, gross, funky tasting extra tiny egg. I'm not sure why they gave me this extra little egg, it made my meal worse.

I thought the glass wall with the etchings of birds (I believe they are birds?), was quite cool and the open kitchen is also nice.They started us off with some bread that took us on our food journey. We each ordered 2-3 tapas and shared what we could, as I don't eat meat, just fish. I ordered the espincas a la catalana - catalan spinach, raisins, pine nuts, apples. It was delish!! Very tasty, a good combination of salty and sweet, which I love. I had the diver scallops which were cooked to perfection and extremely tasty. Of course the patatas bravas had to be ordered because I was craving the ones I had in Malaga, Spain a few years back. Mercats were pretty damn close to those! We had a few varieties of cheese which I cannot recall at the moment.There were a few more things that I ate that I am completely forgetting but I capped it off with a latte and will definitely be making my way back for a longer dinner!!

I was torn on the decor - on one hand I liked it but on the other hand, it was sort of off since it is in the Blackstone Hotel - a recently restored and historic building.I realize they aren't the same but something didn't fit. However, I like the high ceilings, the windows and the bar area. I think it would all look better at night. Then again, I think about other restaurants that are vibrant and I think I'd say the same thing. They offer a lunch special - the Catalan Express where you choose from a soup, salad or sandwich for $18. Online, they listed cured meats and cheeses as an option but I didn't see them on the menu. My dining companions arrived before me and I didn't ask our server about the meats/cheeses as they had already made up their minds. We each ordered salads - they had the serrano ham and fig and I had the ensalada verde. The serrano was a surprising big portion and apparently tasted great too - the combination of the saltiness and sweetness with the cabrales worked well. I really loved my salad as simple as it was - asparagus, fava beans, avocado, green beans and a spanish cheese. It tasted fresh and filling - not like what you normally get in a green lunch salad - usually it's a bunch of greens tossed with a cherry tomato or two and a balsamic of some sort. For the entrees - one had the scallops which were nice and big and freshly seared and the other had a grilled chicken dish. The chicken looked and tasted good, not necessarily an interesting dish but I think that for one who isn't adventurous and wants something straightforward, it was a good choice. Maybe it's just me, but I find that most of the restaurants around the Loop have these \"safe\" dishes on their menu for lunchtime. I assume it's because they get people who work in the area or are tourists that are scared by anything that has any spice or is \"different\". I had steak medallions - small portion over what I think was a potato puree. The server advised me that the meat was prepared medium-rare which I thought would be fine. It was still a little bit to rare in the middle for me but I was pressed for time and didn't want to send it back. The service was fine, our server was a little slow in getting our order compared to how not busy the restaurant was - but not a big deal. Another server saw us trying to get his attention and came over to help. After spending time looking at the dinner menu, I'd definitely want to come back here - I'm curious what it's like on the weekends, I heard it was packed and wonder if it's with hotel guests or people from the neighborhood.

It brings me great pleasure to relinquish Mercat its previous 2star rating and bump it to a 5.A very important business principle IMO is Customer Retention. Smart businesses operate via returning customers who continuously pour money into profits versus the one customer who pays a big bill but is never to be seen again (it's common sense). You know someone is serious about business if they monitor social outlets such as Yelp for any unsatisfactory reviews. Mercat does just that and their loss prevention warrants them a much deserved update. I understand everyone has their off days and \u00a0I'm certain my last visit was probably one of those. But if you don't call attention to these minor slip ups, they could very well become a new model of what's to be expected.. I couldn't bear to allow that to happen to Mercat. Things You MUST Try:- Oxtail Empanadas: the dough is very light, but flavorful. Great texture. The filling had a very great flavor profile. Basically, think of your favorite braised dish stuffed into an empanada shell. Oxtail meat is decadent.- Arroz a la Cazuela: Spanish take on Gumbo. Nice smoky broth accented by the rich unmistakable taste of saffron. Nice accents of spanish chorizo and assorted meats. Very satisfying. Also served with crouton and rouille.- Suckling Pig: Seriously worth the procedure of calling 3 days in advance, etc. Table side presentation, LOTs of pork. If you're a pork lover.. this is for you. I love that they didn't over-complicate anything. The beauteous pig was allowed to shine, and it was not in vain. I would suggest splitting this among 6-8 people. The accompanying sides are very complementary. I used to boast about Chinese Style roasted pork but this has honestly bumped it down a notch on my list. At this point, Mercat's suckling pig reigns.

My gal pals and I also tried the bacon flatbread, spicy potatoes, diver scallops, an amazing rice (almost like a risotto) w/ clams and a short-rib and scallop entree. All of the dishes were amazing and had a pretty presentation. Desserts were also very good. The chocolate croquettes and the butter cake are a MUST try! \u00a0The croquettes come with a marshmallow fluff type sauce- need I say more?!All in all the food was good- small portions, and a little pricey, but a great ambiance.

I knew it would be good, but nothing could have prepared me for what we experienced.We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairings, an amazing choice. The courses aren't exactly one plate, but usually 4-5 in each course. First course amazing appetizers including Mercat's signature bacon wrapped dates and more charcuterie type apps. There were awesome palette cleansers in between like green peppers. Second course was pasta with an amazing rabbit ravioli of sorts. Third course - meat, meat, and more meat. The thing I was most impressed about though, beyond the amazing food, was the service! Matteo, our server, was knowledgeable and so helpful as we planned our dinner. The biggest perk came for my sister-in-law, though. She's pregnant and very conscientious of what she can and cannot eat. They brought her a separate charcuterie plate so that her meats would be fully cooked and a separate meat course plate as well with well done meat.

The variety of tapas is similar to what you may have experienced at other tapas restaurants, but with a little upscale touch or twist to them.Upon arriving I was a little put off by the fact that some of the seats in the small entry-way bar were reserved. To my friends and I it was a little strange that there would actually be reserved seats in such a tiny space. Mercat a la Planxa has an extensive list of specialty cocktails as well as house-made sangria. We all opted for the sangria. It was good and multiples were ordered, but it was not outstanding. Having said that, at the time of our reservation we were escorted upstairs to the dining room which was like a breath of fresh air; two-story, lots of light and fun decor.At first, the menu can be a little intimidating even for someone who has had tapas many times before. Our waiter explained the menu to us and the layout of it made much more sense. The waitstaff was excellent, very attentive and more than willing to answer any questions that we had. I would describe the food as traditional tapas with a twist. An example would be that traditional bacon-wrapped dates are actually bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with almonds. This was definitely a favorite at our table. My table started off with approximately 4 -5 plates and kept one of our menus so that we could order more as we felt necessary. Our waiters recommended 3-4 plates per person and their recommendation was quite accurate. Please keep in mind that these are small plates. Some of them are much smaller than others. The pasta dishes are quite small.All of the food was delicious with a couple exceptions. Of course this is all based on individual taste. Presentation was excellent for all of the items we ordered as well as the items we saw arriving at other tables. One item that stood out as something that may need a little work was the walnut sorbet. After tasting it, I thought it tasted like something, but couldn't put my finger on it. My other half had the best description which I thought was incredibly accurate. They described the sorbet as tasting like Play-doh.My friends and I can't wait to go back to Mercat a la Planxa and try the many other items on the menu.

Even on a weeknight, the restaurant was at maximum capacity. Parched due to the unusual heat wave Chicago was hit with, we ordered the seasonal sangria with rhubarb. The uncommon ingredients married perfectly to create a fresh, fragrant, and chilled cocktail. We simply couldn't get enough of it.Our waiter was professional and polite. One couldn't help over looking his tardiness as the restaurant was super packed and he didn't even have a minute to breathe. Yet, he attended to us with a smile. Tapas, certainly not what you would expect from your local neighborhood joint in Spain. Chef Garces has taken Tapas to a gourmand level with intrinsically prepared dishes and addition of fusion flavors. The community of Catalonia (north eastern Spain) favors garlic and one can surely taste that influence on the dishes here at Mercat; I for one relish garlic in all forms.In between savoring the rhubarb sangria and catching up with friends, we ordered pintxos muranos, patata bravas, morcilla, flatbread, tocino con cidra, gambas al ajillo, cordero lechalel en curry, pimientos, and cheese selection. Aside from the lamb brochettes (kitchen ran out of), we managed to taste everything else we ordered. They even have Roast Pig on the menu which involves advance ordering.The Patata Bravas were presented unlike any of my previous encounters with this classic dish. Crispy tater tots like potatoes topped were adequately with spicy paprika aioli; we ended up ordering seconds.At times, the description of a certain dish tends to evoke fear or disdain in diners; morcilla, blood sausage falls into that category. However, I for one love them; hence I look forward to the signature touches of the restaurant that are bold enough to offer them. Mercat a la Planxa, had one of the best I have tasted in my various travels. It even won the vote of my friends who hadn't tasted them before. With the right amount of sweetness combined with the rice, the morcilla melted in my mouth. Nicely done!The Chef's selection of 3 cheeses was a befitting ending to our delicious meal. The generous portions of cheese were accompanied with finger licking dipping sauces; yet another display of the Kitchen's uniqueness. Mercat a la Planxa seems to serve minuscule portions with higher prices in comparison to average typical tapas fare; however each dish coming out their kitchen is uniquely paired, packed with bold flavors, presented beautifully, and most importantly tasting exquisite.What should have been a casual evening out with friends, turned into a spectacular dining experience commendable of any epicurean's delight.

They hit you from the start with this FREE tapa. \u00a0This was delicious and perfectly executed. \u00a0Great bread (lightly toasted for a bit of crunch) and a very flavorful mix of tomato, garlic, olive oil, etc. \u00a0Bacalao croquetas - These were decent, but not amazing and I probably wouldn't get them again. \u00a0I didn't really care for the peppers served with them. \u00a0Butifarra sausage - This was pretty good. \u00a0I mean, it's pretty basic - just 3 smallish sausages. \u00a0The seasoning was interesting. \u00a0If I was in the mood, I'd get this again. \u00a0Patatas bravas - Eh, honestly I've had better versions of this common dish. \u00a0They weren't fried/crunchy enough and the \"spicy\" paprika aioli wasn't a welcome addition (or spicy).Tortilla - The omelette had potatoes and spinach in it. \u00a0Maybe onion and I think saffron. \u00a0It was a pretty typical take on this dish - it's good, but didn't really amaze me. \u00a0Pork belly - Bull's eye. \u00a0My favorite dish. \u00a0Pork belly with cider, tart apples, and a truffle-y turnip puree. \u00a0It was a fantastic dish. \u00a0All the flavors and textures worked really well. \u00a0I was worried about the truffle being too much (I might be a little sensitive to the flavor of truffles), but it was the perfect amount. \u00a0It was one of those dishes you want to keep eating and eating. \u00a0 \u00a0Chocolate croquetas - How the hell are some of you hating on these? \u00a0I pity the fool...These are ridiculous! \u00a0Chocolate-y, gooey, perfectly-fried little nuggets of awesomeness served with a variety of tasty pairings - banana marshmallow (!!), rosemary caramel (!) , and some exotic olive oil. \u00a0This dish was excellent in terms of texture and flavor and is certainly one of the more memorable, clever and unique desserts I've come across in a long time. \u00a0Can they make them baseball-sized?So while the food overall was very good, there were some additional disappointing aspects of the meal aside from a couple of the actual dishes. \u00a0Well, it's probably obvious, but the portion sizes were too small for the prices. \u00a0The prices were steep and, even acknowledging that they surely use high-quality ingredients and such, I couldn't help but feel a little gypped at some of the tiny portions. \u00a0Also, the odd number of servings in each dish was really wacky - it'd be like 5 croquetas or 7 patatas. \u00a0Why is that? \u00a0It's kinda annoying to split food like that. \u00a0It's a small quibble, but seriously, it seems pretty basic.

We ordered the chef's menu but they tailored it to our exact likes and dislikes, replacing two items with items that were more palatable for my wife (she doesn't eat shellfish). The waiter also kept really close tabs on us, and the food and wine was brought out with pretty flawless timing. * The Serranno Ham and Fig salad was out of this world. So simple, yet such a perfect balance of flavors. * The lamb chops were simply fantastic. Served with two sauces that were completely superfluous IMHO, since the chop was perfect on its own. Minor low lights: * The tuna was only ok, and not up to the standards of the rest of the meal. * The bacon-wrapped dates, which is a classic tapas dish, was prepared with an almond inside the date.

When we were done with the last course, the waiter whooshed by and plopped the desert menus on our table without saying a word.OK, if you don't want details, go down to the the wrap-up.The first course consisted of five dishes, introduced by the waiter as \"strong flavored tapas,\" all paired with a white wine.1) Tortillas with saffron sauce. \u00a0Good taste, could have been stronger on the saffron, but the fact that it was lukewarm was a letdown (you expect food that should be hot to be hot).2) Cheese with fruit spread and apples. \u00a0The cheese was rather ordinary (cabra al vino, similar to a Manchego), and the fruit spread was a pretty good pairing. \u00a0Overall-eh.3) Pan con tomate (bread with tomatoes). \u00a0Honestly? This one tasted like the chef poured a can of diced tomatoes on a piece of bread and served it.4) Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico. \u00a0This is supposed to be the very best dried ham in Spain, similar to an Italian prosciutto only drier and more flavorful, and it was good, but ...I'm not sure... I honestly don't think it was real Ib\u00e9rico. I think they got away with serving regular Serrano ham.5) Dates wrapped in bacon. \u00a0These were pretty good.The white wine that was served with this dish was good. \u00a0Light, slightly acidic, smart pairing. \u00a0But I was thoroughly disappointed at this point. \u00a0I thought we'd see more unique, daring choices.The second course was the best (credit where credit is due) and was served with a fantastic Pinot Noir.6) Grilled chilies. \u00a0Yum.7) Lamb meatballs. \u00a0Double-yum; nice and hot.8) Rabbit ravioli with truffle sauce. \u00a0Very, very good.9) Mini-pizza with mushrooms. \u00a0Given the rest of the dishes in this course, this one was a letdown. \u00a0It was just a mini-pizza.The last course started promising, but then woefully fell apart. \u00a0It came paired with a pretty average-tasting red wine (don't recall the exact type).10) Brussels sprouts. \u00a0Delicious.11) Risotto with truffle. \u00a0Probably the best risotto I've ever had. \u00a0So far so good... but then12) Spinach. \u00a0Ordinary.13) Colorado Lamb chops. \u00a0Ok.14) Half of a small, grilled lobster. \u00a0Looked nice but was -horror of horrors--overcooked.The wine was ok, but the courses took so long we ran out of it before the spinach came out. \u00a0So we had to drink water (or purchase more wine) for the rest of the meal. \u00a0My sense is that if tapas come paired with wine, there should be enough wine to last the entire course.\"Tapas\" means \"tops\" or \"covers\" and it originated in Spain when they would bring out your beer with plates covering the mugs with little bite-sized munchies. \u00a0For me, the thrill of tapas is in a huge way measured by how creatively a chef can serve pretty simple dishes: flash-fried anchovies, braised pig ear cut in slivers, stuffed mini-octopi, shrimp, etc. \u00a0Many of the dishes on this chef's menu simply didn't fit the tapas concept.Then I decided to take another look at the menu online (remember that we didn't look at it carefully at the start of our meal). \u00a0WHAT? \u00a0Turns out they do have exciting, adventurous tapas selections, but none of them made it to the chef's menu. \u00a0My suspicion is that most people don't order that stuff, so that's why the chef's menu is made up exclusively of the bland-palate selections. \u00a0What gets me is that the waiter asked us whether we had any special requests, food allergies or phobias, etc., and I told him \"no, no phobias of any sort, in fact, the more adventurous, the better!\" and I'm willing to bet we got exactly what everyone else got. \u00a0So why ask?I don't like to compare restaurants... too many variables... but in this case I'll say this: fellow-Iron-Chef Mario Batali's Casa Mono in New York City is a FAAAAAAR better place to eat tapas. \u00a0Go there and spend your heart out. \u00a0You won't be sorry.I'll wrap it up by saying that when the bill arrived I was pretty bummed. \u00a0The whole thing cost $340; no extras, except for a \u00a01/2 of a pour my wife had of the white wine during the first course, and a tip. \u00a0I expected to pay that much. \u00a0But I also expected a LOT more quality, variety, courage to serve off-the-wall selection, and--especially with the wine--quantity.", "Date": "2012-12-31", "Author_Location": "Aurora, CO"}, {"Author": "Varsha G.", "ReviewID": "-rSceb_qm0O4IgAVix-wWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a classy, elegant wine bar that I would definitely revisit. \u00a0When it comes to price it is a little on the pricier side but it is worth the experience. \u00a0We did a lot of small plates and thanks to the yelp reviews, I tried the bacon wrapped dates and I am a huge fan.

I never would have thought of doing this and he planned it all out himself. Clever guy, I knew there was a reason to keep him around!We had a special prix-fixe menu with multiple courses that was incredibly reasonable at less than $50 each, with alcohol up to our own choosing. They also allowed us to bring in some of our own wine, which was very kind. We more than made up the difference in cocktails and a generous gratuity which should be standard for those who BYOB in an establishment with a good wine list. Remember that, people, it's only fair to the staff!I should mention first that the space itself is gorgeous. Great energy, high (HIGH!) ceilings, and Spanish music that was at the appropriate volume. Small bar area, which is unfortunate for those without reservations or waiting on their late-comers. And now, the star of the show, the food. Oh, the food:The tapas were delicious and filling. We ordered, ala carte, a cheese course before our menu began and feasted all evening. The cheeses were wonderful and well appointed with pairings of jams and savory tapenades. Plenty of bread. Our first course consisted of pan con tomate, truita de patata con espinacas, and ensalada verdosa. Translated (for your reading pleasure) that means we started with bruschetta, a clever potato/spinach omelette that was delicious and hard to describe, and a green salad. Plenty to go around. Second course was gambas al ajillo, costillas de ternera, and datiles con almendras. Essentially, it was shrimp in a bubbling garlic oil, beef shortribs tapas-style, and bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. OH EM GEE. Those dates and shortribs haunt my dreams.Frankly, by the time we got to our third course which was chicken and chiorizo paella (paella valenciana), we were stuffed and it was actually anticlimactic. I nevertheless ate my share (what can I say, I'm a trooper!) and was very thankful that the kitchen was willing to take care of our non-meat eaters in the group by preparing alternatives to the paella and bringing extra non-meat tapas throughout the first two courses. That's just a major sign of class.Our server (who was the BEST) patiently took photos of our entire group and did an all-around outstanding job. And then they brought us the croquetas de xocolata, which have this marshmallowy banana in them as well as the chocolate, with candles for my birthday boy.

Catalan tapas sound pretty good when you realize mid-quarter that classes are much harder than you expected them to be. Mercat is on the corner of Balbo and Michigan and conveniently accessible by a ton of buses. The entrance to the restaurant is slightly difficult to find, though. You have to go in The Blackstone, and if you enter on Michigan, pass through the bar and ascend a flight of stairs to the main dining area. The dining room is spacious with tall ceilings and an odd beehive theme. We got there a bit earlier than our reservation but were seated promptly in what I consider the best two-person table in the house, at least for a date. We each got the Chef's Tasting Menu and he got the pairings as well. The meal is broken up into three courses, with a couple of dishes each.The first course came out all at once. On the house were a big bowl of olives and a plate of light, airy bruschetta. Three different servers brought our dishes: a plate of cured meats accompanied by crisp bread and various pickles; goat's milk cheese with crisp Granny Smith apple slices and a mango chutney; a spinach and potato omelette. It was a good portion of food to start off the meal, and because the rest of the dishes are brought out more leisurely you get full at a slow, happy pace. The second course began with the bacon-wrapped figs, which are just as divine as everyone says they are. They came out with a plate of butternut squash dumplings accompanied by lamb ragout, beech mushrooms, and truffle which was also wonderful. These are both dishes that I will definitely order a la carte when I go back... probably in multiple portions. We were then served a dish of tender, perfectly cooked shrimp swimming in a garlicky butter sauce. Last was a flatbread of beef shortribs in a sweet barbecue-like sauce with baron, parmesan, and fresh sprigs of arugula. Intentionally or not, a decent period of time separated our second and third courses. This was probably a good thing, as I was starting to get stuffed after the generally portioned flatbread. Our last course began with two vegetable dishes: patatas bravas i.e. spicy potatoes resembling tater tots with a rich aioli, and Catalan spinich sauteed in vinegar with a salad of thinly shaved apple threads on top. I wasn't crazy about either. I thought the aioli was a bit too mayonnaise-like and excessive. The Spinach dish seemed to have a weird aftertaste, but I usually don't like Spinach all that much anyway. The meal then concluded on a plate of medium-rare steak accompanied by two sauces. The steak was cooked well with a crisp edge, but there were some pieces of gristle that I wasn't too fond of. We ordered the Croquetas de Xocolata for dessert and wolfed them down immediately. The banana marshmallows tasted like dollops of heavy whipped cream. Overall we left quite happy and full. One of the reasons I decided to come here, actually, was that most reviews seemed to agree that the Chef's tasting menu was a good amount of food. I think it's a good place to start, but I will definitely order a la carte next time I go, especially since the tasting menu doesn't seem to vary much. I am really not a big fan of Iron Chef America; the Japanese version was overdone in a hilarious way, but there's something about the sanitized and glossy production values of the stateside equivalent that lacks the original's kooky charm. Still, Mercat a la Planxa was pleasant and satisfying.

With a relative paucity of stylish bars and restaurants nearby, Mercat has the potential to be a star attraction in the area. Entry to the restaurant on the second floor is through a curiously small bar which with seats for about ten and a large screen TV, seems incongruous for the whole vibe the Mercat is trying to achieve. The restaurant itself appears to be a very expensive refit of a large two storey space, with a high ceiling, gorgeous arched windows, naked bulbs, and mirrored walls. \u00a0 The food is fine, but to me it was overworked in presentation and just okay for taste. There are no real stand out dishes, save perhaps the diver scallops (the current seafood belle of the ball) and the spinach and prosciutto salad. The flatbreads are expensive, as are the salads and rice dishes. \u00a0We shared the 'sorbets', all three of which were, unfortunately, a disaster: the apple was very fake in taste and colour; the lumpy blackcurrant tasted of raisins and was actually inedible; the third a very weird 'cherry oak' which made us wonder where the 'oak' flavour came from. We didn't finish them.The drinks list is fine, with to me what seems a silly choice of 6 or 9oz wine glass serving sizes (what's the point?) and bottles. The wine list runs predictably heavy on Spanish wines, the verdelho and the syrah I had were fine. There are several run of the mill 'other' wines available, Mondavi etc. Cocktails, sangrias and after dinner drinks are also available but I am VERY suspicious of \u00a0a restaurant that includes a STARBUCKS so-called 'liqueur'. For fear of encountering further Starbucks products we didn't try the coffee or tea.There seemed to be a ridiculous number of wait staff for what was untimely service. When drinks take longer to appear than food, you know there is something wrong... especially when at one point there were 5 staff behind the bar. Odd too was the penchant for two waiters appearing at once, one the big silent type who said nothing until contradicting the other; his partner a really annoying younger person who asked 57 times if we were enjoying ourselves.Having spent several hundred dollars on dinner for three I expect a far better standard of food, wine and service.

Mercat a la Planxa, which features an Iron Chef, is a Catalonia-based Spanish Tapas place. We all went with the prix-fixe menu, which featured an amazing array of food.Our service throughout was exemplary, which is not something I have come to expect from Chicago eateries. The decor was rather over-the-top and somewhat 70's feeling, with a sunken dining room, making the bar and kitchen look elevated. The Chef Jose Garces was walking around, talking to the various tables throughout the night, which was very nice.Course #1: We started with a Bruschetta-esque entree on thick toasted bread. It literally hit all five tastes, and was of a sufficient enough portion that one slice was enough for several bites worth of this. I actually liked it a lot better than bruschetta, because it had an excellent array of spices on it. Additionally, they served very thinly sliced Chorizo sausage along with a light mustard, sliced yellow peppers, and gerkins. The chorizo was flavorful but not overpowering, and sliced so thinly that it didn't end up being filling.Also, they served us little dumpling-sized bits of a \"Spanish Omelette with Spinach, Potatoes, & Saffron Aioli\" -- this was just amazing, and even one of our friends, who truly hates spinach, ate this. It didn't actually taste very spinachy, but it was incredibly savory and while not particularly omelette-y, you could taste the eggs and potatoes very well. The aioli was a small dollop, but enough to be delicious.They also served us Manchego cheese along with a sherry/bacon powder sauce that I personally didn't like, but everyone else adored.Finally, they brought out fried pimientos de padrom, with salbixada and sea salt -- small green peppers with a very, very light mustard sauce. I'm pretty sure I ate half the allotted amount.Course #2: \u00a0We were served dates, wrapped in bacon, stuffed with crushed almonds, and then for the final decadence, a cheese fondue sauce was poured over the top. They then brought out \"Patatas Bravas\" -- spicy potatoes with spicy paprika aioli. Seriously, these were one of the best items of the night -- tiny little bundles of mmmmm. They served us \"Arroz con morels\" -- morel mushroom bomba rice, fava beans, green asparagus & lemon oil. An odd consistency, but seriously delicious.Then, they brought out \"Gambas al Ajillo\" -- simply, garlic in browned butter, served BOILING. The shrimp was hella hot, but sooo good in the simple butter. I used the toast the served it with to sop up the sauce, and would have poured it into my mouth directly if I could have done it and not looked like a TOTAL idiot.They served us a flatbread, \"Costillas de ternera\" -- beef shortribs, horseradish, parmeson and bacon. As one of our friends said in surprise, \"Hey, this has a bit of a bite!\" -- it was an incredibly complex bit of food in terms of taste, with a bit of spicy, a bit of tart, a bit of everything. SO GOOD.Additionally, they served us \"Conill amb chesnut\" -- braised rabbit agnolotti, Rosemary, Truffle-Chestnut Puree, and brandied cherries. This was very ravioli-i, with a very interesting foam on top (the puree) that had a lot more flavor than you'd expect.Course #3: For the main course, which doesn't have the awesome descriptions that the above head but does not take away the amazing quality of the food, we had: \"Colorado rack of lamb\", which I am pretty sure everyone at the table pronounced as the best lamb they'd ever had; Some sort of beef-related product (we can't figure out if it was skirt steak, short ribs, or what; we are pretty sure though that it was the short ribs; and prawns, which were served with heads and tails attached (though I pulled 'em off, 'cause... yeah.)And then there was dessert.Course #4:We had SIX types of sorbet (approximately 2 teaspoons of each): Turkish Fig, Dulce de Leche, Chocolate Peppermint, Milk Stout, Apricot, and Coconut.Chocolate croquettes with creme anglais (AMAZING)A chocolate mousse goopy thing with vanilla ice cream on a waferAn orange creme with some sort of citrus compote (that orange creme was something special)Rice pudding with another sort of creme and a citrus compoteFinally, at the very very end, in a \"just one more little mint, Sir? it's wafer-thin!\" they gave us a pomegranate chocolate cookie thing that was about the size of my pinkie, and it was a wonderful end.", "Date": "2010-03-14", "Author_Location": "Happy Valley, OR"}, {"Author": "Jackie K.", "ReviewID": "Qt2Yx6pIj7YCk_5DiXPJTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The service here was amazing.

It has all the makings for the perfect tapas restaurant - a gorgeous array of cured meats, cheeses, vegetarian, rice, steak and seafood specialties - but it has fallen just short both times I have been. With some simple fixes, Mercat can live up to itself.The high points:1 - The cured meats plate, especially the jamon iberico, is delicious. I consumed my own weight in this stuff in the Basque country several weeks ago, and this was a lovely culinary trip back there.2 - The 8oz filet mignon was perfectly medium-rare. I didn't care much for either of the sauces on the side, but the steak itself was to-die-for.3 - Simple, but the patatas bravas at Mercat are delicious, too. They're always piping hot, a little spicy, and decoratively plated.4 - The cheese plate also has some very interesting accompaniments like olive caramel. Unexpectedly, peculiarly delicious with the sharp sheep's cheeses.5 - Prawns a la planxa. Perfectly grilled and garlicky. They leave the heads on so you can enjoy the best part in the empty cavity.The disappointments:1 - The pulpo. It was chewy. The smoky paprika was lovely, but I had to pick around the plate to find the softest pieces for my boyfriend so he could taste what it should really taste like.2 - The paella, both times, was far too salty and burned on top. It's great conceptually, loaded with seafood and chorizo, but we had to request an additional bottle of water after finishing half the small plate. I also didn't care for the overcooked crust on top.It's important to mention that the service is wonderful - very attentive, courteous and helpful. Decor is also a major plus. The space is innovative, modern and comfortable. Although there are a few too many tables and it can get noisy, it's so visually appealing that I didn't mind. The menus - dinner and dessert alike - are memorable for their mix of classic Spanish fare and very unique flavor blends present in many of the sauces.

In addition, all of the issues that i had noted from my last dining experience there have been corrected and service was even better than before.We started out with the appetizer special, which was an Oxtail Empanada. The dough was nice and light and wasn't greasy at all. The oxtail was delicious and tender.We also enjoyed the Pulpo Con Patatas, which was tender and had a nice smoky taste. In addition, we ordered the Arroz ala Cazuela which was just divine. It was super flavorful and all the flavors were married really well. I would definitely order this again. Now the show stopper-- The half SUCKLING PIG was amazing. It was perfectly seasoned and had tons of umami.The skin was perfectly crisped. The table side presentation was also awesome. The chef neatly separated the parts of the pig while giving us an explanation and even discussed the process of cooking the pig with us, which was really nice. We are the adventurous type so we took advantage of the head and tried the jowl, brain, and ears. The brain was prepared with a cherry gastritis and it was magnificent. If you can try the suckling pig, do so!The pig was accompanied by wilted spinach w/ apples, fingerling potatoes, and rosemary white beans all of which were delicious as well.

We had paella negra, which was very tasty and seafoody, but much too salty. However, when I bit into a big chunk of octopus I felt like I was hanging out in a tide pool in the sun. It was a most delicious feeling, though I got only two big chunks of octopus. We also had some goat's milk cheese with green apple slices and garlic dulce de leche. I know, garlic? Dulce de leche? It was so good that I didn't understand why no one else was putting garlic in their dulce de leche. We also had rabbit in homemade pasta. Mike had to convince me because, you know, rabbits, but this was my favorite dish. It came out with foam (I love that, Mike doesn't), with brandied cherries under (I was worried they'd be too sweet but they were not) and brown butter sauce and pureed chestnuts all over. It was delish. It was so delish that I sat there and ate the sauce with my fork while my boyfriend sat there and judged me. The only issue was that the rabbit was a little tough, though I understand that's the name of the game with... game. For desert I had chocolate mouse with some sort of crackly hazelnut and sugar shell, espresso hanging out in the shell, and sweet cream gelato on top. It was good, but unlike all the other dishes it was too big to finish.So, a good meal but I would have been happier paying about half as much for it, as it had issues.

LAWD this place is delicious! I met my cousin and his gf there for a 5:30 dinner. They had already ordered red sangria, so I had some. Far from the cloying hot mess that sangria is, with generic fruit bits and cheap brandy throughout, this truly tasted like red wine. So far, so good!Almost everything you can order here is tasty - at least everything we ordered was! I like how this restaurant has so many options, too. The ONE negative thing is that the portions are tiny and the prices are sky-high. That much makes the restaurant very much a NOT everyday sort of place. Still, I think the flavors are so good that it's worth it every so often. Helpfully, the service is relaxed and friendly. Our waiter and my cousin had a nice time chatting about scotch.The presentation itself is fantastic, but even the presentation doesn't match the sheer quality and taste of the ingredients themselves. Perhaps the best example is the side of mushrooms - we ordered two in total. My cousin's gf and I thought, \"These look and smell good. I bet we will enjoy them.\" Then we ate them. The intense flavor of the wood-roasted, garlicky (but not overly so) mushrooms - with bits of eggplant and potato chunks - were beyond our expectations. Our cousin wondered if they could be that good. Then he ate them, and you could tell that he agreed. The sizzling gambas al ajilo were perfectly executed, and I'm still drooling thinking about the oil and garlic in which they were cooked.The potatoes are a tiny portion, well plated to boot. Their smokiness is almost overwhelmingly intense! The pork belly was also great - not too fatty, with a nice, light sauce that balanced the dish.

The flights sampler of sangria was totally worth the $13. The cheese and meat platters--- meh. The meat sampler has a good quantity, but the slices of cheese were small. The sauces they come with are fun, but nothing to rave over. Heirloom tomato salad with feta was yummy-- good for sharing.Then comes the paella. The nice thing is that they give you a time it will come out, so you can pace your tapas eating accordingly. However, it had onion!! Ugh. The waitress told us \"so sorry--- I got the message about the paella, but there was no mention of onion.\" Hmm, ok... She said she would check in the kitchen for an alternative, and said that this \"never, ever, ever happens\" but they will make an exception and make me a small paella. She promised it would be quick, so I agreed. Here comes the baby paella-- super, it looks DELICIOUS. I dived in with a big woo hoo--- sausage, crispy rice, fresh tomatoes, a crapload of parsley (wtf?), and... ONION! Seriously?? She confirmed with the kitchen. \"The chef cleared it, but the message didn't get to the cook...\" How big is this kitchen?!!? They said they'd make another. My friends were already done with their food, and my meter was about up. I was embarrassed that this had to turn into an ordeal. I said I didn't need anything else and I just needed to leave. The manager came over to apologize, and brought lamb ravioli. That was nice, since I didn't order it. But I didn't like it (mooshy gravy/stew-like sauce, but great pasta), and again was just embarrassed that this was holding up our check. They also brought out comp'ed dessert. 4 pieces of chocolate covered cinnamon ice cream over a rice krispie. They were good, but awkward to eat-- too big to be bite sized, but not easy to bite into. Luckily the check came afterward, so no one was looking at eachother eat... we were busy bulking at the check.I am REALLY REALLY sad that I couldn't eat the paella.

Really, lady? There are no plates in front of us anymore and now you're concerned about what we might have needed? At one point of our meal I looked in the general direction of the bar area. Our server was walking down the steps with a glass of red wine for one of the tables. I watched in disgust as she PUTS HER WHOLE NOSE AND MOUTH into the wine glass to sniff the wine. Wtf????

\u00a0If you are a skinny European, then this place is PERFECT.As for understanding the food, the staff had little knowledge outside of reciting the ingredients. \u00a0For instance, the first dish (which was complementary) was \"pan con tomate\" - a simple piece of toasted bread rubbed with garlic and crushed tomato, drizzled with olive oil. \u00a0I asked the bartenders where this dish came from, or its origins. \u00a0The only spanish person working mentioned a story of how it was made, but really, it is a Catalan dish - meant to make something special out of day-old bread. \u00a0Here, the interpretation was much more advanced, even for a piece of bread.The rest:Charcuterie Mixta - 3 kinds of meat served with bread and condiments. \u00a0The slices were ultra thin, and the size of a silver dollar.Nice flavor, but that was our protein for the night. \u00a0Setas a la planxa - Nice mix of 3 different mushrooms, perfectly cooked and seasoned. \u00a0This was the best main dish of the night.Paella Negra - Squid ink rice with squid, very good and rich. \u00a0Nice dish, but just enough for 2 to share, for one to finish. \u00a0Protein here too.Croquetas de Chocolate - little fried chocolate balls with marshmallow pillows and caramel. \u00a0Tasty - 6 bites was enough. \u00a0The croquetas were hot and the execution perfect.Datiles con bacon - not much you can do with a date wrapped in bacon, but they put a little frise salad with a light blue cheese dressing (almost a play on a buffalo wing presentation). \u00a0If they had added a bit of heat to the date, it would have been over the top.So, to summarize, expect a great flavor, great food, but make sure you're on a diet, cause you will be wanting a bit more.", "Date": "2009-11-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Brenna M.", "ReviewID": "4zXw45rUKd0mezx2ZyWhEA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A lot of loooong reviews for this restaurant.I'll spare you the heavy reading then:1.

People saying the portions were too small.. it's TAPAS. Know your food. And the price was well worth it for the flavors.. okay, now to my review:Yesterday my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place because we needed something to eat while we waited for someone in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge to be done. We were trying to choose between tapas and sushi, and boy am I so glad we chose tapas. When we entered, after walking up the stairs, we were astounded with the interior of the restaurant. With it's high ceilings, unique lighting and modern decor, I was already happy with our choice.As for what we ordered, the only thing I wasn't 100% happy with was the Red Sangria, mainly because I figured it would be sweet like it usually is, but I've noticed that city drinks are just stronger. I later tried the (and yes, I'm just copy and pasting the names from the menu online) CHARRED PINEAPPLE MOJITO, which was fantastic. It was almost like a pineapple version of a Mike's Hard, haha. But it satisfied my sweet craving.For food, we ordered:TRUITA DE PATATA which was just what I had been craving. I would definitely order this again. The flavors were fantastic!PULPO CON PATATAS which was great! I had never had octopus before so I have nothing to compare it to, but flavor was very unique and the meat was very tender. GUATLA ANEC UVAS Y POLENTA which was quite delicious! The roasted grape glaze on the quail was to die for. But my favorite thing on this plate had to be the goat cheese polenta croquettes. That cheese was to die for! I definitely want to sample their cheeses next time. TOCINO CON CIDRA which was the best thing out of the entire meal. It was to die for! \u00a0If you're looking for something fantastic, get this! Combining all the ingredients on the plate has got to be one of the best flavors I've ever experienced.For dessert we ordered:\"CREMACATALANA\" which has the be one of the best desserts I've ever had! That sweet potato ice cream is amazing! And the combination with the bavarois... YUM!PASTISSOSD'AVELLANA which I didn't care too much for, but that's because I didn't want it in the first place. My boyfriend really enjoyed it though if that's your cup of tea! c:And to top it off, our server was amazing. She was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu and she was of great help when it came to deciding on what we wanted and selling us more food/drinks. I wish I remembered her name though.

I don't know what else they could have done other than weaving magic into this dish. \u00a0The pairing of heirloom baby potatoes and cider braised chorizo was out of this world. \u00a0The potatoes were soft and soaked up the sauce really well while the smokiness of the chorizo complemented them perfectly. \u00a0But the manchego espuma sauce was bowl-licking good! \u00a0Drooling!Serrano Ham and Fig Salad: Fresh with just the right amount salty and nutty. The sherry-shallot vinaigrette laced everything so that every forkful was tasty and tangy but not overwhelming. The serrano ham and fig added character to the dish while the nuts gave it some crunch. \u00a0Pelotas de Calabaza y Cordero: Each item by itself would have made this dish ordinary, but together they could conquer even the pickiest eater's tastebuds! \u00a0The delicate flavor of the butternut squash dumplings matched with the lamb ragout in the most interesting way. Somehow the squash diluted the \"gaminess\" of the lamb and made it into some sort of awesome. \u00a0The beech mushroom escabeche & black truffle rounded out the dish. Trutia de Patata: Playful square packages of yumliciousness. \u00a0These spanish style omelette with spinach, potatoes, and saffron aioli would kick any other square packages and gigantic half-moon shaped omelette's butts. \u00a0The pasta-like skin on the outside was al dente while the inside was mashed potato heaven. It's hard to describe the overall flavor profile of this dish. \u00a0You just have to try it for yourself. \u00a0Too bad it was only one or two bites worth. \u00a0Everything else (the flash fried peppers, the serrano ham & chorizo croquettes, the shrimp asiago-esque flatbread, and the goat cheese & grilled sourdough) were excellent as well. \u00a0We ended a great meal with Croquetas de Xocolat - small fried balls of milk chocolate on top of sticky marshmallow, caramel, and premium olive oil.", "Date": "2012-02-25", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Kristen P.", "ReviewID": "muFAD-drsMfoGfSpDXyZXQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was my second visit to Mercat and I think my first was a bit better.The first time I had gone, I think my experience was better because I had a bigger budget to play with.

Not a fave, but worth trying.Gambas al Ajillo - Garlic shrimp. Good, but expected and... too much salt. [Third course]black angus rib-eye- Good, but It's rib-eye. Perfectly cooked, but could have trimmed the fat.

It worked out that a Wednesday night would be the best for us so my friend made a reservation requesting a window seat, divulging that we are foodies not some out of town conventioneers and foodies who would be reviewing their visit. Not only that, we were there to celebrate a birthday and wouldn't it be nice if they could stick a few candles in whatever dessert we would end up orderingI arrived first, or so I thought, and took a seat at the bar in the Bodega just inside the front door. I ordered a specialty cocktail called the Matador, a Hendrick's Gin based cocktail with, among other things, beets and fresh thyme. The drink I received had neither beets or thyme because, the bartender said, he was out of them. Nevermind. A few moments later one of the other two friends arrived. She poured over the menu and ordered a white-foam topped cocktail that had, again among other things, white wine and basilAs our reservation approached ee made our way upstairs to the dining room and checked in. The hostess assured us that she had reserved the requested table at the main window, until she realized someone else had been seated there. She did note that another window seat was about the empty and that we could have it, but it wasn't really the table my host requested. The other person at the front desk offered us each a glass of Cava while we waited for our friend and our table in the small and tight holding pen a few steps below the hostess standThe space is punctuated by a view of the kitchen, lots of tile, a 70's inspired honeycomb that stretches from the Bodega downstairs to within a few feet of the ceiling from which hangs modern bare-bulb pendant lights. Mirrored walls with caricatures of Iron Chef Garces and his staff working the Bodega and restaurant seemed to expand the space while the warmer tones keep the space exactly that.When the table was ready we were seated and our waiter was quick to approach and walked me through the menu as I was the newbieWe were encouraged to order 3 to 4 things per person and I was assured the portions were big enough to share which hasn't been my experience in other tapas restaurants. But my fears were soon quelled. We each ordered 3 things and before we knew it the food was flying out of the kitchen before slowing down towards the end of the meal. The 2nd flat bread we had ordered was one of the last things to come out. It was considerably more 'done' than the first which was recommended to me: a beef short rib bread with bacon jam and caramelized onion topped with a copious amount of Parmesan cheese that didn't bring nearly the salt the dish needed. The 2nd flat bread had mushrooms and ... allegedly ... sausage, but the sausage was sliced paper thin and only noticed by one in our party who peeled it away from the bread. I still wasn't entirely sure it was sausage as it was overpowered by truffle oil that intensified the taste of the mushrooms. In fact, the running theme of the evening was truffle oilFried dough balls were the most disappointing, including the ham and cheese croquettes that had no ham flavor whatsoever and the, what turned out to be 'free' dessert, of milk chocolate croquettes that simply tasted of fried dough, over-powering the weak milk chocolate. That they were free in honor of my birthday was a poorly veiled insult. Salmon was over-cooked and lacked flavor beyond the crispy skin and I almost forgot the unimaginative salad we picked through and let the waiter clear when it was just over half eatenStand outs included the rabbit in pasta, rillettes (with more bread), the plantain and spinach empanadas (mostly thanks to a very flavorful 'relish' that contained red bell peppers that were beautifully marinated) and the foie gras. The only grilled item (apparently their 'specialty') was the garlic shrimp ... with the heads still attached. I was excited about sucking the head, but they were empty. What is the point of serving a shrimp with the head if the brains have been removed ... and by whom? The shrimp were nice and large, beautifully cooked, meaty, white and redolent with garlic and sauce.There were questions about the quality of the vodka served over the vodka ordered ... and lo and behold, the 2 more Matadors I had both contained beets (a mash in the bottom of the glass that lent a very faint earthiness to the drink) and a soft sprig of fresh thymeFreebies included the garlicky-tomato bread and fresh, mild, green flash-fried chilies with a Romesco sauce ... and the milk chocolate croquettes thanks to my making it through another birthdayWhile this review feels a bit harsh, we did enjoy our time and most of the food.

However, Having had such positive experiences at 2 other tapas restaurants in Chicago, why not go for 3 for 3?I was set up to come here to meet a guest. I left the burbs an hour and some change early, got there 20 minutes late anyway. Word of warning for those who are coming from the burbs...either plan ahead or...plan ahead. That's all there is to it. Traffic in downtown Chicago is brutal (to say the least) and coming during dinnertime is a verifiable nightmare.Anyway, enough about my travels, let's get to the grub.The table \"bread\" is amazing. I think it was some kind of bruschetta, but it was absolutely delicious. I could have gorged myself on just those alone.My dinner companion and I elected to go with the \"Chef's Selection\", which is cornucopia of food. Be warned, however, it because it IS the Chef's selection, you are going to PAY for the chef's selections. Very impressed with the types of flatbread, cheese and spread plate. As well, I loved their dumplings (I think that's what they were). About an hour into our meal, we still hadn't finished anything and the waiter brought out steak knives. At that point, we were both stuffed...but we managed to get some more food down anyway. I think it was more than 7 different types in total, but my memory is somewhat hazy.We also elected to go with a pitcher of the white sangria. However, since they were out of pitchers, our waiter instead promised us 3 glasses of sangria apiece. Since this was an option, we decided to try all three types out and we were very happy that we did. The white was very weak (emphasis on VERY), the red had a very strong wine flavor that didn't overpower and yet still left you with a pleasant tingle, and the seasonal was nothing to write home about. Can you guess which sangria we liked best?Check time came and I realized why we had gotten so much food. I remembered rather suddenly why I don't eat out very often. I'm not complaining though...we had an exemplary meal being served by a top-rate waitstaff. While I'd love to come back often, it's the price tag that makes me realize that perhaps often is a little much. Save up a little and make an occasion of this trip.It's also important to note that it can get a little crowded, making navigation to the bathrooms a little difficult. That and some of the prices \u00a0were the only things that knocked off a star. (Hey, have you SEEN gas prices? How does one afford to eat AND drive these days?)End result: Parking is available through valet, food is pretty pricey, but with good company it's a great dining experience.

This is \"foodie\" stuff! \u00a0And as the selections came off of a tasting menu, I was curious about the dishes. \u00a0That extra moment it takes to describe--briefly, I know you're busy-- what I'm eating makes the experience much more rich and enjoyable. \u00a0Besides, I want to know if you've given me horseradish cream or a butter sauce; there's a huge difference in flavor.3) Food: \u00a0It was nice, some of it outstanding, and delivered at varying temperatures, some of it much too cold. \u00a0I wondered, if I can see the kitchen from here, why are my shrimps cold? \u00a0The spinach dish is unbelievable. \u00a0I could have eaten a pound of it.Everything else was nice...Alas, those low points sure were lame. \u00a0The Gilt City deal made it a nice experience, albeit one that I am unlikely to repeat.", "Date": "2012-05-05", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "N U.", "ReviewID": "LgUv8joaNd27d7eEf-yvfw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The food was great.

I got to sample the meat, cheese, and dessert station located in the center of the dining room. The cheese I think it was gouda was alright - pretty standard. They had chocolate-covered strawberries and super cute tiny raspberry tarts. Our first course consisted of sweet potato-almond milk buckwheat pancakes topped with sliced strawberries, cardamom whipped cream, and syrup on the side. These were most excellent. And then came the bacon wrapped dates. They were amazing and couldn't be any better. Our second course was a salmon benedict and peppers. The beautifully-plated benedict was made of seared skuna bay salmon, a poached egg, a sherry compressed tomato, and maltese sauce atop a potato croquette. The padron peppers, green and shaped like chili peppers were served with a yummy salbitaxada sauce. By the time our third course arrived I was feeling pretty full, but didn't want to miss out on the revuelto de conejo and cochinillo asado. The first was soft scrambled eggs, braised rabbit, brussels sprouts leaves, glazed carrots and truffle chestnut toast. The cochinillo asado was a roasted suckling pig with grilled onions and romensco sauce. I didn't care for this dish so much, but then I probably wouldn't like it no matter who made it. The bloody mary bar had three choices of mixes - a traditional, and then two lighter mixes - one a pale green which was really mild, the other pink which I didn't try. I went for the traditional, and added chili powder, paprika, a pepper shaped like a tiny pickle, and a celery stick. They had one kind of fun addition which was a jalapeno pepper stuffed with sausage and a watermelon ball on either side stuck on a skewer.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. One of the people in my group is a vegetarian, and the cook actually prepared separate dishes for her, which I thought was really thoughtful. For each course, the chef came out to tell us all about what he had made.All in all this is a fantastic choice for brunch and I would definitely come back.

Still not the best location, but at least we had a window on one side and weren't stuffed between two parties.Whatever, it's about the food. The wine was good. We ordered a lovely bottle of Rioja. The short ribs and scallops that I ordered were pretty good. Half of the short ribs were way too salty though. We ordered about 5 more dishes, but I don't remember anymore. In general, very good. Creative plating. That serrano spinach salad stood out though. If I come back, that'll be part of the reason.

It's inevitable, I suppose, that a whole micro-verse is necessary to serve the convention and tourist crowds, but it's also unfortunate that the city's best \"Spanish\" restaurant belongs, and wants to belong, squarely in the realm of the out-of-towners rather than in the cold (and overweight) embrace of area foodies. You gets no love.Ah, air quotes--nature's pretense. But work with me here: this is largely not a Spanish restaurant. Sure, Mercat advertises itself as Catalonian, but it's serving tapas (uh, Madrid), with lots of non-native elements (see: eggplant puree)--definitely not Catalan. That's bourgeois American conceptualization of Spanish food, folks, and that is pretty fascinating to observe...sort of like watching old people run frantically to catch a Blue Line Train that has, in fact, been stalled in the station for the last five minutes. Okay, kidding: watching old people run is much fascinating. But isn't it amazing that what we perceive as contemporary Italian or Spanish is really American, rid of regional dogmas and nationalist preoccupations? Let's have a little more faith, people!Well. It had been a year since my last visit; they did, finally, change the opening menu--which \u00a0must have been in place for a year--but took off the one knockout dish, a squid ink pasta with aioli that was among the better things I ate in 2008. Jose Garces, for what it's worth, is one of the most consistent whole-menu visionaries I've come across--there isn't a single thing on the menu I wouldn't want to eat--but rare is the truly memorable, truly unforgettable dish. That's by design, surely: you come here, max out your per diem, enjoy your meal, and poop it out a day later. Ephemera.But plenty of pop, though. With tomatoes in season, the introductory pan de tomato (Catalan!) sings--so much so, that I'm not sure why Garces serves this the rest of the year. The cheese plates are nice, bowing to tradition with a little contemporary flair: we had a hard goat cheese that came with a garlic dulce de leche, allowing us to make nice little sandwiches of cheese, granny smith apple, and the caramel. Pasta remains a strong point: the squash dumplings were beautifully creamy, a glimpse of fall; I found the lamb ragu and lamb bacon superfluous, however. Of the two surf-and-turf dishes, skip the scallop-short rib dish--over-salted, and the additional parts (eggplant puree, artichoke salad), while tasty, did not cohere--and go for the serrano-wrapped tuna, which is a fun textural experiment thanks to the accompanying foie gras and croquette. Because my father doesn't eat pork, we also ordered a couple of classics--tortilla Espanola, gambas al ajillo--that were entirely inoffensive but were presumably far below what we could have gotten if the, well, 85% of the menu was more amenable.To the part where I get to being an old maid: the pricing is getting obnoxious. This place was never cheap, but the 10-20% per-dish increase over the past year is especially gnawing in light of the steadfastly small portion size. On a per-bite basis, only Spiaggia has more expensive pastas: we're talking three small dumplings (smaller than Urban Belly) for $14. Really. Some of the vegetable sides were also $14. We had the Escalivida, a \"plate\" of marinated vegetables that literally had one small pepper, three grape tomatoes, a cippolini onion, a small mound of eggplant puree, and some figged-out bread--it was great; it was $11. Again, really. We had to prompt our server to get the once customary petit fours. In other news, I've now officially become my mother.Last year I would not have hesitated to bestow a four-star-er on this place, but natural's not in it, no longer. The cooking is (generally) great, but it is not true. It is, in spite of the talent behind it and the consistency within, depressingly corporate. I never thought I'd say this--and apologies for doing so--but this place has no soul.", "Date": "2009-08-28", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Amanda A.", "ReviewID": "Nkkd6OEPqnYspWfY_InuAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great chefs choice menu.

I think I've reached the age where I'm OK with the fact that I don't always visit the \"hot spot\" right after all the hot reviews. (perhaps this is why it took so long to get to 100?)I digress. For more than a year, I've been meaning to visit Mercat, only to have something change at the last minute...With a visiting foodie in town, though, I vowed to finally make it this time, and invited Jenny S. along for the ride.We arrived on time for our 7:15 reservation and the hostess was nice when she told us we'd have a short wait. This proved to be accurate as we were seated in about 15 minutes, but in the interim, the downstairs host stand is next to the bar and we lucked into three empty seats and kicked off the evening with a round of drinks. I went for the Two Brothers draft but the others opted for the merengue--which smelled delicious--and the mojito.Both bartenders provided excellent service while juggling the rather boisterous lounge patrons at the time.Upstairs, once seated, three of us immediately dove into the menu, each choosing two tapas/courses to share. The best of the best: Butternut squash dumplings with lamb ragout. The grilled shrimp were the most traditional thing we tried but that shouldn't count against it. Excellent presentation and nice flavor. The La Peral cow's cheese almost made me weep if only because I was too stuffed to eat or order more of it!The good: Dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with almonds (an always dependable dish but am I being high maintenance wanting more than 4 per order?); Seafood paella--generous servings of fish but a bit lacking in flavor. Still a solid dish. The fennel and white bean salad arrived late in the meal and as a result, we didn't finish it, but it was flavorful and had a nice portioning.The meh: Mango sorbet started out sweet and nearly destroyed my throat at the end. Say what? There's red pepper in there? Put it on the menu please.While the service overall was solid, it's a bit annoying when you have to ask twice to see the wine list. Also, our waiter never stayed put for long and I had to ask him for more water. Not a huge issue, but guests should never have to ask for water. I'd visit again for sure.

As far as tapas go, these are some of the fancier ones I've had, though not among the best. \u00a0The basics and classics, such as bacon wrapped dates, were disappointing- you can get better at a less chi-chi place, like Ba Ba Reeba. \u00a0Fair enough though; this place is geared towards the exotic tapas, and some of them were quite good, like the spinach with green apple, and the short rib with diver scallop. \u00a0Others, like the butternut squash pelotes were weak. \u00a0More on the topic of this dish in a minute though.Service was really the big downside of the experience though. \u00a0Our waiter was weird and irritating, sucky-uppy and constantly doing the not-so-subtle upsell. \u00a0An occasional, \"excellent choice\" after I place my order doesn't bother me, but it's tapas. \u00a0We ordered six or seven dishes and really don't need to be patted on the head for our food selecting savvy after each choice. \u00a0\"That's my personal favorite,\" \"Oh, those are delicious!\" Yep, thanks. \u00a0The more obvious upselling ('What delicious cocktails can I get for you?' \"Which dessert would you like?\" instead of 'Would you like to order something to drink?') was annoying, but it was the covert, sneaky upsell that really bothered us. \u00a0We ordered the butternut squash pelotes ($14) and the waiter said, \"and that dish usually comes with 3 pelotes, but I can do it with 4 for you.\" \u00a0It was close to closing time and there were two of us so we assumed he was doing us a favor, and said, \"thanks!\" \u00a0The dish turned out to be essentially four teeny squash tortellini- \u00a0overpriced for what it was, but it turned out that they had also charged us an extra $5 for the 4th one, bringing the cost to $19 for 4 little squash lumps. \u00a0And if you do the math, you'll also notice that the \"bonus\" one was more expensive than the three that came with the original dish! \u00a0Overpriced already, not very tasty, terrible pricing for the add-on, and truly awful and sneaky upselling.When I brought it up with the manager, he seemed shocked that the waiter had not informed us that there would be a charge, and also said he was surprised that they would have charged $5 for the extra squash tortellini thing, and said he'd talk to the waiter about it. \u00a0But no offer of a refund or anything like that, just said he hoped we'd still consider coming back at some point. \u00a0All things considered, probably not. \u00a0Even if it had been cheaper and the service less sketchy, there are better places for tapas in the city.", "Date": "2009-03-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christa R.", "ReviewID": "3B0AreV1S5ce1HsvIAVvhA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is absolutely fantastic!

The Merengue is the very reason that Absolut Grapefruit has become my vodka of choice. it's blended with fresh strawberries and a mango and lime puree. Yeah, a girly drink, but so what. Turns out it was the best cocktail I've ever had. Then we headed upstairs and had a variety of tapas and cocas: patatas bravas, espinacas a la Catalana, almejas y tocino, costillas de ternera, and lucky for us, one of Jose Garces' iron-chef-winning dishes was on the menu that night: sliced iberico and cantaloupe terrine. The patatas bravas were like grown-up tater tots. they didn't have that hashbrown texture, but were more refined and served with a paprika aioli. Delicious. The almejas/tocino and costillas cocas were excellent Spanish-style \"pizzas.\" a little on the salty side, tho; the former combined bacon, clams, and brandade (which is a like a salt lick all by itself), and the latter consisted of shredded beef shortribs, horseradish, parmesan cheese, and more bacon. Pairing these with salads instead of tapas would have been a better choice. Next time...The terrine was the best thing I had that night. It was simple but had a stunning presentation, with layers of thinly sliced serrano ham and cantaloupe; that classic pork-fruit combination doesn't get any better than this.Mercat is pricey, but well worth it, in my opinion.

\u00a0[Note: Must be ordered 72 hours in advance] I took all my fellow Yelpers advice and ordered the Premium Mesa de Jose's Tasting Menu. \u00a0Our fabulous waitress covered all bases by checking if anyone had allergies or dislikes, explaining the difference between the Premium Tasting and ordinary tasting (the premium basically includes the more expensive menu items; ej. lobster versus shrimp) and was super friendly and courteous to the point of giving me a menu marking down which items were including in the tasting. \u00a0Accompanied by my wino friend, we purchased a bottle of Garnacha/Tempranillo mix to accompany our food versus paying the overpriced wine pairing. \u00a0This was after sipping on a cocktail each of El Bolero and Merengue; both nothing to call home about.On to the Tasting...I will say that our favorite dishes, note that none were disliked, were the following (I included the menu's Catalan names for reference):-Bacon-wrapped Dates Stuffed with Almonds (Datiles con almendras): Best I had EVER had, which says a lot since they seem to have become popular at many restaurants across the city.-Braised Rabbit Agnolotti (Conill amb chestnut): One of my top dishes that was similar to a rabbit ravioli with a delectable truffle-chestnut puree and sweet brandied cherries.-Colorado Rack of Lamb: Easily the best lamb I had ever eaten with a delicious jus poured over the top with tons of flavor.-Colorado Lamb Loin Brochettes wrapped in Bacon with Lamb Jus (Pintxos muranos): Ultra tender with tons of natural juices and tasty bacon.-Serrano Ham & Fig Salad: I have been to the Museos de Jamon [\"Ham Museums\"] throughout Spain and wherever Mercat gets their serrano ham from is outstanding, plus this salad his huge with large, tasty figs hidden within.-Morel Mushroom Bomba Rice (Arrox con morels): Ultra fluffy rice dish with tons of truffle oil; What's not to love about that?!-Green Bean Salad with Serrano Ham (Judias verdes con jamon): I'm not a fan of vegetables but if this is what my mom prepared as a kid I would have quickly eaten my daily portion of greens.-Also included in the tasting were the following: Mixto cheeses and marmalades, Spanish Omelet (Truita de patata), Mussels (Mejillones a la rousillon), Porcini and Catalan Sausage Coca (Coca de cepes y butifarra), and half Lobster.I finished off my meal with the Croquetas de Xocolata which is not to be missed! \u00a0They're little fried balls of dough (croquettes) injected with milk chocolate which are to be dipped in the accompanying banana-marshmallow foam/creme and rosemary caramel. \u00a0The display alone is gorgeous being served on a deviled egg platter, but once you pop into one of those little fried gushers the display is easily forgotten about.My one [easily fixed] complaint is that the dishes came out quickly in the beginning and then became spaced out by 20 minutes or so towards the end. \u00a0My other would be the close proximity of the tables, but that's just how it goes. \u00a0Otherwise, Mercat is the perfect spot for a special occasion like an anniversary and the Chef Tasting Menu is extraordinary with a good variety of dishes and plenty of food. \u00a0So make that Open Table reservation ASAP.", "Date": "2010-11-30", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Phill C.", "ReviewID": "FgVLYcAH2wXvUcZ1i7Ia0A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came last night for the first \"Iron Chef Monday\", which was featuring Mexican chocolate. \u00a0We got the Iron Chef tasting menu for two, but also ordered additional items since those portions were smaller. \u00a0Tooootally didn't have to do that, since I was struggling half way through the meal... or maybe that was because I had huge burger for lunch. \u00a0The Mexican chocolate tasting menu included 3 courses and a dessert (each course having 2 menu items and 1 Mexican chocolate dish). \u00a0I now realize some of our chocolate dishes were substituted with regular menu items. \u00a0The kobe beef tartare never came out and we never got the waffle with chocolate sauce. \u00a0Instead we got a chocolate \"funnel cake\", which was more like chocolate covered rice krispies with a papaya sorbet. \u00a0I was just so full I couldn't think straight. \u00a0But it all makes sense now, since the table next to us was told they had run out of the Iron Chef menu portions. \u00a0Out of the the special dishes I tried, both were okay. \u00a0The smoked duck over the chocolate linguine was perfectly cook. \u00a0The chocolate mole pork loin could've been a bit more moist, but the chocolate tamale was delicious. \u00a0Out of the other dishes from the tasting menu, the only one that I really enjoyed was the serrano ham & fig salad. \u00a0The salad was wrapped by serrano ham, into a salad meat log. \u00a0Filled with figs and large crispy chunks of pork belly. \u00a0Also the bacon-wrapped dates were delicious. \u00a0Crispy bacon, stuffed with almonds, with hot blue cheese poured over. \u00a0Other then that, the rest of the dishes were just okay.Service started out great, with our server informatively describing some of his wine recommendations. \u00a0But as the night went on, the service got much slower, and it took a very long time to get our check. \u00a0I'm glad I tried the Iron Chef Mexican chocolate menu, but nothing I would come back for. \u00a0Maybe just some of those bacon-wrapped dates at the bar...", "Date": "2011-04-05", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mandy B.", "ReviewID": "-3schzm30Zwsd2mnjhKA_g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We came for my mothers 60th birthday.

I didn't know which wine to get and he brought me a couple of wines to try. He was just like a sommelier with his vast knowledge of the liquids. However I should have known he would bring me two of the most expensive wines on the menu to try. $16 for my glass of South American vino.*Not on the Iron Chef Monday menu, we had the Cadi Urgelia which was quite good. It's a cow milk cheese platter but honestly, nothing is cooked so if this was somehow messed up, that would be a big shame.*The Serrano Ham & Fig Salad (on the Iron Chef & the regular menu). This had such a creative presentation and was so tasty. I don't usually like salad but this was encased in the thinly cut ham with just the right amount of sherry vinaigrette, plus tasty spiced almonds to boot. Perhaps my favorite dish of the night!*The bacon wrapped stuffed dates, Datiles Con Almendras (only on the regular menu, we ordered & paid for these separately like the cheese plate). All tapas places seem to have these but the presentation and being topped with the sauce make them top notch here.Mediocre which should probably be under bad but I can't say they were horrible.. :P*Truita De Patata Con Espinacas, Spanish omelette with potato, spinach & saffron. Not much I can on this except it was just okay.*Espinacas A La Catalana...Okay spinach but nothing too appealing.*Gambas Al Ajillo, garlic spciy shrimp. Underwhelming.Now the bad...Dun Dun Dun Dun...*some people had their own nice tables, but if you're a party of two expect to be smooshed next to a bunch of other parties of two. Lame to not have the proper personal space while dining.*Nowhere did they say you need to be very specific in saying you wanted the Iron Chef menu. The table next to us went to try the Iron Chef Monday menu and the waiter informed them that was not going to happen, they only had 20 portions! Really? For your special opening night of this you made enough for 20 people? Errrrr. That really sucks. The guy at that table was quite annoyed because he called and asked about it the menu when he made their reservation and nothing was mentioned about having to secure the menu. Thankfully we did note we wanted the Iron Chef menu in our Open Table reservation so we were granted the privileged. The worst part....they substituted menu items and no one ever told us this was going to happen!!! Um....since when can you just change someone's dishes? Especially one of the special Mexican chocolate items! What in the world!? This was just such a poorly executed special menu for Mercat. We never got the Kobe beef tartare or the Canela waffle with chocolate sauce. Ridiculous when that was the whole point of this menu. Argh!*Costillas De Ternera beef shortribs, horseradish, parmesan & bacon Flatbread...we each had one piece of this and didn't finish the rest....didn't even take it home. The flatbread itself was good but the toppings weren't great.*Mexican chocolate tamale and Mexican chocolate Iberian pork loin. Yay I thought! Something from the special menu! The Pork was good, the tamale was not.*Mexican chocolate linguine with smoked duck.

He told us the kitchen was backed up and I'm understanding of that...but at this point we were just waiting on our dessert.*Dessert. Well this wasn't the dessert we were supposed to get AND we just waited 30 minutes for it to come out...30 minutes for some cocoa puff things and a bowl of sorbet. Argh.*So after we finished our dessert, we waited another 30 minutes for him to ask us if we needed anything else. Then another 10 minutes for our check. We put our CC right in for him to take so we could leave but it was another 5 minutes before he came back to us.

The menu was good and had nice choices. He went with the ham and fig salad and I had another salad with cheese and veggies. Nice. Good sangria, too.

The service was horrendous and we didn't even get served! We went to the bar at 6 and were told we couldn't get an actual table for dinner until 8:15. So we sit at the bar. They told us we could eat at a bar table then. We know what those are like, tiny with little doll-chairs that are so uncomfortable. We passed. We'd wait.We returned at 8:15, promptly. \"it''ll be a few minutes,\" we were told. At 8:30, we are offered the same bar table from 2 hours before. The exact same table!!! I told the woman this so she said we could have another tiny table but with a banquette for seating. Okay, a little better.

Food: \u00a0I think the food is why the restaurant deserves a solid 3 to 3.5 stars. \u00a0The food was okay. \u00a0Nothing spectacular. \u00a0I'd say good but not mind blowing. \u00a0We ordered the $35 chef's choice, \"la mesa de Jose,\" and the $18 express meal. \u00a0The chef's choice came with an assortment of food based on obviously, the chef's choice. \u00a0The $18 express meal allowed us to pick one first course and one second course, along with a soda. \u00a0We chose the Spanish omelette and the burger. \u00a0TRUITA DE PATATA CON ESPINACAS: The omelette was what you'd find at any other restaurant except they have this ginormous hunk of cheesy aioli on top. \u00a0It tasted fine. \u00a0THE MERCAT BURGER: This burger had some sweetness to it. \u00a0Comes with PATATAS FRITAS, basically fries with a bunch of seasoning to it.

My last meal there still stands as one of the best meals I've had in my life. I was looking forward to being able to re-sample some of the dishes I loved last time (espinacas a la Catalana, how I love you!) and trying some new ones. While the experience was not as stellar as the last (we visited on a Friday evening at 7:15, so the restaurant was much busier and service understandably less impeccable), the restaurant maintains its status as my favorite in Chicago - and gives Amada a run for its money as my favorite JG spot. This was my first meal after making it to the city, so I arrived hungry and ready to do damage to the tapas menu. Luckily, my friends can eat, so we were able to try everything I was looking forward to. The menu is expansive and you're not going to want to choose. Come hungry, bring friends, and leave the picky eaters at home (although vegetarians will be perfectly happy - 67% of our table did not eat meat or fish, with me being the notable exception). We started with the cheese mixto, which is very well put together. I have forgotten two of the cheeses, but one was a very good, rich garroxta. The highlight of the cheese plate is definitely the accompaniments, though. The vegetarians were in ecstacy over the garlic dulce de leche (one is coming to visit me in Philadelphia soon and is thrilled to know that she can actually purchase it at Garces Trading Company!). What they don't know is that if they ate meat, they could have had the sherry-bacon caramel, which puts absolutely everything else we ate that evening to shame. I literally licked the bowl. That good. Although the menu is very meat-heavy, there were plenty of dishes to keep my vegetarian friends happy. We ordered one of the specials, which was reminiscent of scrambled eggs - with truffles and truffle oil. It had incredible flavor and depth. The special was intended to include shrimp, as well, but was absolutely great without them. We also ordered the bomba rice. I skipped this dish (you'll see why by the time I get to the end, I can only fit so much at one meal!) but the vegetarians enjoyed it, including the one who is not a particularly big fan of rice. All of us loved the truita de patata, which is a traditional Spanish tortilla (and essentially the same thing as the tortilla Espanola at Amada). The espinacas a la Catalana was just as delicious as I remembered, leaving me wishing that Amada or Tinto would add it to the menu. \u00a0To round out our vegetarian selections, we had the patatas bravas, calcots a la planxa, and llientes i cigrons. The potatoes and green onions were very good and prepared perfectly, although not particularly innovative. The table was split on the lentil and garbanzo bean dish. It arrived at the end of the evening, though, so those of us who did not love it may simply have been too full to appreciate it. It was definitely innovative, though - the texture and flavors were new to me!I was the only one at the table who ate either of the two meat dishes, so you will have to trust my word on them. Don't worry, I have vast meat-eating experience (on this vacation alone I managed to eat 9 different animals) so you can totally trust my opinion. The first dish was the cordero lechal en curry - roasted suckling lamb with chickpeas, broccolini, and served with flatbread. When I first tasted the dish, I didn't love it - I just had the lamb with some sauce on the flatbread and didn't think the flavors were great. \u00a0Then I got smart and tried a bit of everything on a fork. Oh, my! That made all the difference. The flatbread turned out to be absolutely unnecessary; we used the rest to eat the llientes i cigrons. My last dish was the conil amb castanyes - braised rabbit agnolotti. It was absolutely delicious. When I described it to a friend, she was suspcious - rabbit in pasta? The answer is yes. Rabbit in pasta. Thumbs up. Along with the incredible meal, we enjoyed some of the seasonal sangria. It was very refreshing; my only complaint is that, with the addition of Absolut raspberry, it's dangerously delicious! By the end of dinner I was definitely feeling my drinks. We shared the chocolate croquettes and crema Catalana for dessert, although we just nibbled the flavors were great. One friend reported that the chocolate croquette made her feel like a chocolate-eating vampire. Mercat a la Planxa did not disappoint. It is definitely always going to make it onto my list of places to eat when I visit the Windy City.

I'm not looking for what the most popular whites are - I'm looking for crisp, refreshing, minerals . . . didn't we just go through this? \u00a0Anyway, his suggestions were at a very reasonable price point (which I appreciated) and I ended up selecting one of them mostly because he didn't have anything really to say about the other whites. \u00a0It was the 2006 Gran Vinum Nessa Albarino and ended up being pretty good - not as dry as I'd like, but definitely worth ordering again.Moving on. \u00a0We ordered 7 dishes - a number that I thought was going to result in leftovers since there were only three of us. \u00a0One of our choices was the \"mixto\" cheese plate that included a selection of three cheeses. \u00a0When I asked the waiter what the selected cheeses were like, he looked like I'd asked him a ridiculous question, snickered and said \"one's goat, one's sheep, one's cow.\" \u00a0Now I wanted to murder this guy. \u00a0After some prodding, he finally came out with the following: \"Two are more mild and one is a little stronger.\" \u00a0Come on. \u00a0If you're going to devote a whole section of your menu to cheeses, then your waiter better know how to describe them at least a little. \u00a0When our food finally came (I'd say it took about 30 minutes for the first dish to come out - even the cheese plate took that long), the results were as follows:Mixto Cheese Plate: \u00a0Three good cheeses, but all very similar. \u00a0All pretty mild, no soft or semi-soft cheese, all wedged, all about the same off-white color. \u00a0Not much of a \"mixto.\" \u00a0But they were delish and the fruity, tart relishes served with them were excellent.Sopa: \u00a0I can't remember the description of the soup we got - I wasn't part of that decision. \u00a0Suffice it to say the soup was excellent. \u00a0The broth was rich tasting (and green), but felt light and velvety. \u00a0There was some kind of delicious croquette served in the middle of the soup which was to die for. \u00a0And there was definitely truffle oil. \u00a0Enough said.Ensalada de Pulpo: \u00a0I love octopus. \u00a0And I love it char grilled at a Spanish restaurant. \u00a0But this was a big disappointment. \u00a0Despite the name, the dish was a few pieces of octopus sitting on one side of a plate and a small pile of bibb lettuce and frisee on the other. \u00a0The octopus was a little too charred and had pretty much no seasoning. \u00a0It was bland.Tortilla Espanola: This is my fave dish in any Spanish restaurant and I demanded that we order it. \u00a0Again, a very small crabcake sized portion, but delicious and dense. \u00a0Served with some kind of saffron sauce that was good, but was too overpowering a flavor for the eggs and potatoes. \u00a0Bacon Wrapped Dates: \u00a0I fell in love with these things at avec and now when I see them on a menu I have to have them. \u00a0These were very good versions, much smaller than avec (about half the size) and with no chorizo. \u00a0Instead, there were slivered almonds in the center of each date which gave it a nice, satisfying crunch. \u00a0Unfortunately, before I could stop them, they set down the plate of dates and poured some kind of white ranch sauce over all of them. \u00a0Bogus. \u00a0They were delicious, but I wiped off most of the sauce. Porcini, Sausage and Manchego cheese flatbread: \u00a0This was neither Spanish nor flatbread. \u00a0It was pizza and pizza is delicious, hence this was delicious. \u00a0I don't think they used Manchego cheese - tasted like good old mozzarella to me.Grilled Barramundi: \u00a0Tiny portion, not enough seasoning. \u00a0Boring overall.Dessert: \u00a0The croquettes are excellent - like little churros served with marshmallow. \u00a0But go for the homemade helados. \u00a0The cream cheese, rosemary and sweet pea were AMAZING.The bill came to $80 a person and we all felt satisfied, but not stuffed. \u00a0I think in the future, when I want tapas, I'll save my money and go get the real thing at Cafe Iberico.", "Date": "2009-06-19", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Pepe P.", "ReviewID": "uEORWii3-3IwwKf42MC4rw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the third or fourth time I visit this place. \u00a0The food as usual was very good. \u00a0My big complaint tonight was the poor synchronization of the drinks with the food. \u00a0I ordered a martini and the two ladies with me asked for wine. \u00a0My drink arrived over 5 minutes before theirs, with the food. \u00a0I expected better than this. \u00a0This was a Friday night so I guess we excuse more failings on amateur nights.", "Date": "2009-11-06", "Author_Location": "Hinsdale, IL"}, {"Author": "Chilin T.", "ReviewID": "x596BBtKy-ji2S7LKr6Kbw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "food: 4 of 5value: 1.5 of 5decor/ambience: 4 of 5quick review: a forgettable dining experience.food was good - however you do not get what you pay for. \u00a0for example butternut squash which were about 1.5 square inch was ~$4. \u00a0we ordered the following: butternut squash (good), bacon wrapped dates (very good), short rib and scallop (very good), and shrimp/scallop balls (play on their meatballs - ok).", "Date": "2009-11-29", "Author_Location": "Glendale Heights, IL"}, {"Author": "Kerry P.", "ReviewID": "BU4Xg29tfAj6qB814vKccg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me preface by saying I've been here twice. \u00a0The first time was several months ago and I thought it was really good. \u00a0The second time was less than desirable.

Our wonderful server, Sally, toured us through the menu, highlighting some of the more popular tapas options there, as well as her personal faves. She didn't lead us astray on anything. My group of 4, shared a very reasonably priced pitcher of white sangria. It was some of the more flavorful sangria I've ever had, with a lovely peach taste to it. Since we were planning on being up in da club after dinner, we stuck to a few light options. Here is the list: chef's cheese selection (very generous portion), Verdosa salad, bacon-wrapped dates with almonds, butternut squash dumplings (which melted in our mouths), and short rib flatbread. I loved that the dates had almonds; it was a nice change to a tapas staple. And the meat on the flatbread was about as tender as it gets.

The cheeses were tasty, though not anything mind blowing.Following this was an amazing soup, the chicken broth infused with saffron giving it an incredible flavor and color. It had delicious chorizo, chicken, potato, and rice in it. It was topped with a slice of toasted bread covered in their house-made smoked paprika aioli, which paired amazingly well with the soup. This was probably one of the stars of the meal.Next was a skewer of their amazing chorizo, and some tiny omelettes with spinach, onion, and potato (this was the only thing I didn't really care for - but I'm not a big omelette fan anyway - others at the table loved it). Following this we had wilted spinach with black currants and pine nuts topped with shaved apple. Perfectly charred steak (with amazing flavor) over shredded short rib meat, on top of a potato pancake. Gigantic tiger prawns (with the heads still on - that was a little weird for me, had to have someone else behead the beast, haha). And an AMAZING little cast iron skillet filled with a medley of garlicky mushrooms.I was totally full at this point (and worn out thanks to the stupid cold) and did not partake in the chocolate croquettes, which were apparently orgasmically good.My friend who came with me said it was the best meal she ever had.

However, my alarm bells went off because she suggested the Chef Selection for the group because that'd make it easy. I didn't want too...$58 was already $15 more than I wanted to spend on actual food....but, had to...EVERYONE at the table is required if anyone wants to do the chef selection.Ok, fine. I'll do it. Experience right? Splurge. A plus...they accommodated for the vegetarians at the table and brought out some fantastic veggie side dishes when the rest of us had meat.What do I remember that was good? The little chili pepper dipped in mayo sauce was tasty. The lamb was excellent. The veggie dishes that had Murielles (spelling?) were awesome...I adore those mushrooms tho...best fungus of all. The beef...I got stuck with a butt piece so I didn't get to taste the pieces that were cooked rare...I like my meat bloody.

My Chinese self squealed with delight...too bad I wasn't comfy enough around my party to ask for their prawn heads so I could eat the brains. I think I grossed out the vegetarians that surrounded me. Sorry! That's pretty much all I can remember....Chef Selection didn't include dessert. :(As with any large party, there was some discrepancy over the bill, but the waitress was nice about it. I was more embarrassed than anything. Charged a 19% gratuity...that was fine..we had table of 7 and I thought it'd be more along the lines of 20%. The waitress did a great job bringing the bill when I asked for it, and we split it among several cards. Tip: Ask your server for a pen and piece of paper so you can write down the appropriate amounts for each card...make the server's life easy. A+ to Mercat for accommodating. At the end of the day, for me alone, tip+tax+food, I was at $83...I kept having to tell myself...it's a special occasion. We ran a bit late and weren't out of there by 7pm like I wanted but no biggie.Bottom line: I need a side job here. $100 for a table of 7 when I hardly did anything? Jeez, I wish I had food runners, bus boys, water refillers when I was a waitress!!! The food was good...small portions, but there are tapas places that are more worth the $.

Nonetheless, I worked in the food service industry for long enough that I tip 20% standard unless something is *really* wrong. So I did. We had spread the tab equally across 5 credit cards; I quietly tipped a couple dollars more than the others (who, it should be noted, were all tipping at least 15%).

Second course, We order the Mercat Burger and Barri Gotic ( hanger steak). \u00a0 \u00a0 We sip, we chat, we sip some more. It's 12:50pm and still no first course. Ooooooook. We stop a busser and request our waiter. We sip, we chat....we then watch the table next to us receive their 1st course. It's now 1:00pm. But we were seated and ordered before them, what's the issue?!?! We stop another person walking around \"hi, we've been waiting for our food...hmmm... FOREVER, can we speak to our waiter to see what's the hold up?\". \u00a0They come back and say it's coming right out and drop complimentary peppers on our table. I don't want your peppers se\u00f1or, I want WHAT I ORDERED. And I want you to apologize because the reality is, you forgot to enter our order. I'm no fool. Things started picking up a little after we walked in and you were overwhelmed, just say it!!!! \u00a0 \u00a0 Finally we get our first course: a salad and soup. didn't realize salad and soup took 40 \u00a0minutes to prepare. Did you pick this fresh from the lettuce farm? Was the soup flown in from some foreign country prior to? So confused. We annihilate the soup and salad.WAITER: \"would you like us to get your 2nd course started\" US: \"Hell Yea?!\" \u00a0 \u00a0 We received our 2nd course shortly thereafter, thank God. It is now 1:40pm. The waiter comes back to the table and asks if we would like to try dessert. I ask if it will take long? He laughs. I straight face him. It takes everything in me not to say, \"I'm f***ing serious, is it going to take you another hour or can you make it quick\". We decide not to risk it, pay immediately and leave. It's now 1:55pm. \u00a0 \u00a0 I'm not a fan of two hour lunches, servers neglecting tables, and overall \"so-so\" dining experiences. The food was pretty tasty but overshadowed by the service.

If it's Italian, I like dressing up, something tailored by a Milanese man perhaps. If it's Indian, I throw on a tunic and a shawl. If it's Mexican, I won't go so far as to wear a sombrero, but a little color never hurt anyone. So, when I went to Mercat dressed up like a flamenco dancer, I felt like a complete moron. The restaurant was dressed up enough. It needed little help from me or my ruffled shirt. The layout is a big oval with festive-colored walls and deep shades of fuchsia, red, and orange everywhere. The decor a nice complement to the somewhat-dim lighting and somewhat-sophisticated clientele. Needless to say, this is not the place to dress up like a cultural stereotype. Leave the fringe at home.Thankfully, the food distracted me from feeling too self-conscience.This is to say: the food is incredibly good and you really can't stop eating. Instead of navigating the menu ourselves, we (all eight of us in the group) ordered the six course tasting with the wine pairing. It was a smart move. We started with a creamy manchego and honey. The cheese was smoother than most manchegos I've tasted with a slight nuttiness that paired well with the cloyingly sweet honey. We then moved on to a sizzling shrimp that I didn't care too much for (the shrimp smelled fishy - never a good sign). We were then given a salad tossed in an excellent vinaigrette which was wrapped in a casing of serrano ham. It was perfect. Unlike most salads, this one was substantial in volume and taste. The vinegar in the dressing cut the fattiness of the serrano in just the right way. Next course: patatas bravas. These were served in single servings with a great spice paste resting on top. We were also brought a lamb dish and bacon-wrapped dates that were to die for. All in all: an excellent meal.Two complaints: First, we made a reservation two weeks in advance and still had to wait forty-five minutes before we were seated. Second, the wine portions in the pairing are bit austere. If I'm paying an additional $40 for wine, I want to get a bottle's worth.

It was served sizzling hot in a mini black cast iron skillet. \u00a0If you order one thing at Mercat a la Planxa, make sure it is these mushrooms. Unbelievable flavor and if this was served in a giant bucket, I would have no problem finishing it.For dessert we ordered both available options: the Pastissos D'avellana (Hazelnut-Mascarpone Gateaux, Apricot, Dulche de Leche, Salted Hazelnuts) and the Croquetas de Xocolata(Milk Chocolate Croquettes, Banana Marshmallow, Rosemary Caramel, Arbequina Olive Oil). I gave the full descriptions because they read exactly as they taste. We destroyed both of them and left no sauce or crumbs on the plate.

If it were only a matter of the food, my rec would probably be to give it a shot. In fact, we had a number of very tasty dishes. The short rib flat bread, pork belly, mushrooms, and black lentil concoction were all stand-outs. The starter meat plate was very weak (they choose three jamons or something similar for you - none was particularly good); the halibut was not that flavorful nor were the mussels. We did enjoy the desserts a lot. Terrible brewed coffee; the Golden Nugget's is better.However....as a dining experience I wanted to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible, as did everyone at the table. A lot of things to note: * It was a very rainy night and generally S Michigan Ave is a dumpy location for a nice restaurant (maybe all the tourists around don't know better) but no valet parking that we could identify; in retrospect maybe the Blackstone hotel (where it's located) had it but the point is it wasn't in front of the restaurant and we circled for street parking. * As several other reviewers noted, it was way too noisy and pounding house music wore us down through the evening (I actually like house music when it's a great mix; this was really generic). The place was the opposite of hip (if that's what they were going for): it was mostly older couples (guilty!) and a bunch of tourists in shorts and golf shirts (at 8pm on a Saturday, I just don't get that) who probably stumbled over from the Hilton & Towers next door.* The menu was really hard to figure out. I mean, really confusing. Hard to describe without actually seeing it and then having it explained for 10 minutes. Supposedly \"everything\" was small plate and there was supposed to be some sort of progression (we were told three stages, but nothing on the menu would suggest that), but then you had meats at 3-4 different parts of the menu and generally the price range on these small plates was massive, ranging from ~ $6 to ~ $50. We got it but it took too long. It also led to other problems....* The service was very mixed. Oddly the restaurant had very few bus boys so it was our server who was always filling our waters. More importantly, we had dirty plates and silverware (this is small plate tapas with lots of different flavors/sauces coming at us) sitting in front of us with no one coming by for more than 10-15 minutes. At one point I insisted on a clean plate and the helper we found brought just one for me and not the others at the table. Re the menu-related issues, we ordered WAY too much because our server pushed more and more food. Not having any sense from the menu of sizing, we ordered a ton and somewhat predictably walked out too stuffed. She seemed to be going by a script that we had to order a certain amount of food at each stage and was a bit aggressive about it. Most aggravating, she kept pushing that we order the $45 8 oz. wagyu beef dish or the $48 lamb chops (four small chops), which by the way were listed up near the small starters and not near the mains at the bottom (?). If she tried to up-sell it once, but it was more than once and as our wives noted, it was all too pushy.For a bunch of reasons, don't eat here.", "Date": "2010-06-06", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Frank M.", "ReviewID": "XpG0bmDi12uD81XES2qroQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Holy crap is this place amazing! \u00a0The waiter recommended the lamb chops and it came with these two great sauces on the side.

We made reservations for 8pm, we arrived ten minutes early and were told to wait at the bar until our table was ready, no biggie because we were ahead of schedule. We waited until about 8:10 and checked on our table. Still, not ready, and the hostess told us there was one table ahead of us. A table ahead of us?? We're not on the wait list. We have reservations which means there should be no one ahead of us since our reso was for 8pm and its 8:10. Clearly they were behind on wait times, but she didn't seem too apologetic, which was even more annoying. So back to the bar we went. I had some kiwi cocktail which was very refreshing! We sat at the bar until 8:40 when someone finally came to get us. On a positive note our server, wish I remembered his name, was pretty awesome. He knew the menu inside out and was efficient. We had a pitcher of sangria, which was delicious, and ordered 6 small plates: cheese mixto plate, jamon serrano, garlic shrimp, scallops, bacon wrapped lamb, and short ribs on flat bread. Each dish was amazing!...with the exception of the scallops, they fell a little flat, but still edible. For dessert we had chocolate and marshmallows. Sweet and just the right portion, little flavorful bites. Overall, the food was pretty good, but Mercat might want to have a talking to their hosts. If you're behind on times, communicate that. Don't make the guest feel as if its their problem. Maybe check on the guests a few times to reassure them you're working on their table. Apologize! The point of making a reservation is not to wait. 10 minutes, okay, 40 minutes is ridiculous.

We almost always do the Chef's Tasting menu to make it simpler because we are usually a party of 6 to 8. The servers are always attentive and accommodating. They know exactly how much to bring out with perfect timing, and if there is a special request (like someone doesn't eat shellfish) they will bring a substitution for that person. HINT: ask what is new for the season. For example, last winter we had an amazing tapa made from chestnuts, not on the summer menu. The servers will then be sure to incorporate any tapas that you specifically want into the tasting menu.I don't understand the people who complain about the small portions. Um, they're tapas. They are supposed to be small and no one is limiting your order. I've brought some friends here with cave-man sized appetites and even they came away stuffed after the Chef's Tasting.

It's an amazing deal ... for $25 you get a choice of four tapas and that includes bottomless mimosas, sangria or bloody marys. For brunch they have a special section to choose from with 'eggy' selections in addition so to some of their best tapas from the dinner menu. Additionally for an extra $6 (I think) you can go up to the carving station for the suckling pig and charcuterie selection. Trips are unlimited so I suggest some creative ordering if you get my drift. We started with coffee and our 'eggy' selection with mimosas for course. Then had the more savory selections brought out. Service was great. We never ONCE had to ask for our mimosa glasses to be re-filled.

Overall the food was great. \u00a0Some items were disappointing but most were great. \u00a0I could eat the suckling pig and dates every day. \u00a0If I ever saw the shrimp and grits again though I would run away screaming. \u00a0One other little pet peeve was that our water glasses were empty rather often. \u00a0I would like to try this place again, but definitely not for brunch.", "Date": "2012-03-18", "Author_Location": "Arlington, VA"}, {"Author": "Ilir A.", "ReviewID": "Lbxog1rMO25RqrGIuY-SbQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In the beginning we ordered several tapas, but bacon wrapped dates were especially great.

Let me start out by saying that I love Chef Garces. I've eaten at all of his restaurants including my favorite, Amada in Philadelphia. I ate at Mercat for the first time four years ago when I first moved to Chicago. Garces was not an Iron Chef yet, so the place was less packed than it is now! I still go to Mercat any chance I get. The menu changes twice a year and I prefer the Autumn menu. My favorite things on the menu: the mushroom soup with caviar and cr\u00e8me fraiche, Wagyu beef, patata bravas, and the chocolate croquettas. This places is expensive because the portions are so small you need to order a lot to walk out satisfied and the alcohol is also expensive. I've gone to Mercat several times and the quality of the food never changes. The wait staff however is hit or miss. I've had two bad occasions there, once when the waiter wouldn't leave us alone and was being too pushy and the other time when the waiter mocked me for not knowing that the menu changed when I asked for the soup I loved, he was relentless and brought it up the whole time during dinner.

We picked Mercat over several other tapas places in the area because it billed itself as \"Catalonian\" fare. Having sampled many delicious tapas in Barcelona last year, we were pumped. However, I think we would have enjoyed the meal much more if the restaurant avoided drawing that comparison. We made a reservation for 9:30 PM, but when we arrived we were told that there were no open tables. What? There isn't really a great spot to wait upstairs, and we were afraid that if we went to the bar downstairs, we would miss being seated. So, we stood and waited next to the hostess stand for about 20 minutes. The atmosphere was awesome, though. Great interior decorating, house music playing.When we finally did get seated, our waiter was slow to take the order, and seemed very \"pushy\" about getting us to order everything we would want at the beginning of the meal. While in Spain, we ordered tapas a few at a time, eating and drinking slowly to savor the food, so this was a little disconcerting. To start, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, patatas bravas, jamon pato, and a pitcher of the seasonal sangria. To Mercat's credit, the food did come out promptly. The bacon wrapped dates were phenomenal, and we ordered a second helping almost immediately. The jamon was good, but we needed additional bread. The patatas bravas were a letdown, little more than glorified tater tots. We also wondered why the aioli and the spicy paprika sauce were mixed together, and why the portions were so darn small! Still, we are suckers for anything with mayonnaise, so we ordered a second helping of those, too. To finish, we tried a trio of sorbets--- the mango sorbet is a real shocker, I'd advise anybody to try it once. Our chief complaint was our waiter. He clearly snubbed us because he felt that our $100 pre-tip tab was not up to his standards. It was extremely difficult for us to get ahold of him throughout the meal to order more courses, although he doted on the tables on either side of us who ordered the overpriced tasting menu. We are young professionals, and regularly leave a 20% tip for good service, but his nasty attitude cost him. Also, why don't they train their servers to correctly pronounce the names of their dishes? I did not order \"bravo potatoes\" ;-)The seating is very tight, so if you get jerks seated next to you like we did, your experience could be affected. The women next to us were going on and on about how one's daughter just came out as a lesbian, and constantly yelled about how the food was \"horrible.\" So, be aware. Overall, we got much better tapas at a much better price in Spain, even in touristy spots, and even with the crappy exchange rate. I was really expecting something more authentic than this--- if it's not authentic, don't say it is.

The bacon wrapped dates were to die for. It was an explosion of flavor. The \"Mixto\" selection of 3 cured meats was served with tiny peppers and grain mustard. A little different for tapas, but very good. We ordered the goat cheese with the pear coriander jam and we weren't too sure about the cheese. Our server noticed right away and was not only willing to offer us a different cheese at no charge, but he comp'd us the dish and brought us a surprise plate of delicious grilled octopus. It was so wonderful to have someone so astute and courteous serve us on such a romantic and wonderful evening. It really made our night. To end our meal, we had the Chocolate Croquettes - omg. Yum. It's like a warm melty cocopuff surrounded in a gooey marshmallow cream. Unreal. I will not hesitate to come here again. We lucked out. Great experience, great service and delicious food.

If there was ever a dish with one of those proteins featured, she would switch it up for us with a vegetarian option. Needless to say the food was DELICIOUS. We were all saying \"yum\" after each course was served and by the time the end of the meal \"meat and potatoes\" course we were all so stuffed! It's too bad the food was so delicious, we kept on eating anyways!! We all left this restaurant happy, full, and excited to return for another 3 hours dinner at a new favorite :)", "Date": "2010-03-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mary D.", "ReviewID": "3zWaNw03tqfcGsq7S9HlBw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let's start with my basis for comparison, which is Barcelona, however unfair that may be. \u00a0Also, all four of us have pretty high food standards and eat out often and find Chicago to be a great food city. \u00a0Summary of review: \u00a0I was embarrassed that I brought my friends here. \u00a0 We came for the Rioja Wine Dinner (part of the Restaurant Week rioja promotion) - pre fixe with a glass of wine from Rioja. \u00a0Let's start with the wine markup - 400% over retail on the three bottles I checked - norm is 250 - 300%. \u00a0The tasting menu, billed as 4 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert, was all in single bites - 5 tiny bites of appetizers per person (2 were potato, one was deep fried peppers very oily and bland, and the 4th was bacon wrapped dates (which were the high point - just delicious, and for this one we got 2 small dates per person); entrees were one single squash dumpling per person, and one tiny piece of pork belly per person. \u00a0So literally the entire dinner was 7 tiny bites (counting dates as 2 bites) of mostly not their best food items, mostly starches. \u00a0Dessert was mediocre at best (pasty rice pudding, bad Catalan Crema ( here a curdled egg custard), and an OK chocolate mousse thing with a skin on top like it had been sitting for a while, and I forget the 4th because it was declared gross by everyone else so I didn't try it. \u00a0It's not that we're cheap or into huge portions - quite the opposite - we go to good restaurants all the time and happily pay big bucks for quality and little portions, we tip well, plus we each ordered another glass of $21 wine which bumped the bill up considerably. \u00a0This was simply beyond acceptable and even at $35 (of which $12 was wine), it was a rip off. \u00a0If you had told me it would be 7 bites of something starchy plus a glass of wine and a glue-like dessert I wouldn't have ordered it. \u00a0This experience cost them a repeat customer, and I suspect they are hurting for profits or they wouldn't have done such blatant cost-cutting on the food. \u00a0I also think based on my last few visits that the quality in general has slipped considerably since the first year it was opened, while the price skyrocketed (mostly on the wine and drinks). \u00a0The quality is now too uneven for me to bring business clients and quite frankly, Chicago has much better places for the money (like Purple Pig or Province, which also participated in the Rioja promotion). \u00a0For the same price as a regular dinner at Mercat, I could go to Bonsoiree and bring my own (much better) wine, or Blackbird, and get good food and great wine. \u00a0Yes, Mercat has the energy of a cavernous, raucous New York restaurant. \u00a0If you want to pay dearly for energy, this is your place.", "Date": "2010-05-26", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Tiffany G.", "ReviewID": "pQRCsVjYLtnbwwyHEDflCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OMG !!! Anytime you go to a restaurant two days in a row your either really greedy or the food is EXCELLENT!. I'll go with the food is EXCELLENT! I've been here about 3 times in 4 months and will probably go again before the snow melts. It's just that good. I've never had garlic spinach with pine nuts, shredds of green apples sprinkled on top. It sounds very different and it is, but it's very good. I went with my sister on the 1st trip and the chocolate balls we had for desert were soooo good I had to come back the next day with my husband for desert only. I've never had fried chocoalte balls with melted marshmallow and some type of sauce drizzled on top melt in my mouth until eating here. It was the best desert I've ever had in my entire life.....I'm not exaggerating! \u00a0It was a little more expensive than your average tapas restaurant but \u00a0it was worth it. When you go try to get a table next to the window and you'll have a beautiful view of michigan ave. During the weekends Mercat is busier but you can still get a seat in a reasonable amount of time. The only thing that didn't please my palate was a rice dish.
