I arrived 10 minutes early for my 8pm Opentable reservation. Upon checking in, I requested outdoor seating because it was a beautiful night. They said it would probably be about a 20 min wait and that they would text me. I headed to the noisy bar. By the time we got our drinks, the text came that our table was ready (less than 20 min). They had blue cheese stuffed olives which were delicious but my dirty martini was not dirty enough (not dirty at all?); I requested and immediately received a little more olive juice added. My friend's gin martini was perfect. The martinis were served in the old fashioned rounded martini glasses (not cone). Love that!!! The outdoor seating was a whole different world. It was quiet and semi private since there were high walls enclosing the outdoor dining area. I started with the Caesar salad which was amazing- very cheesy and made the way I requested. I would order this again. I ordered the special of the night which was a wild caught salmon. It was so fresh! But I thought maybe a little too done. I mentioned it to the waitress who offered to take it back but I didn't want to bother with all that. The manager also came out and made the same offer and then offered dessert which turned out to be a show stealer! Peanut butter something. I don't know and I don't want to know because I would order that next time! For his main, my friend got the elk which was incredible. I tasted it and made a mental note to order that in the future.

After talking it over with the boyfriend I chose the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. WHICH WAS THE BEST CHOICE EVER! Anyway when the waiter came to take our order, he told me that there was only one Soft Shell Crab Sandwich left in the back and said he'd try and get it for me. My boyfriend chose \"the Regular Burger\" medium rare. After waiting a little bit, we got our food. I was so excited when the my plate was placed in front of me. The sandwich was superb! All the ingredients combined to make a party in my mouth. I have no other way to describe my food. The portion was JUST RIGHT as well. Just thinking about that sandwich makes me super hungry.

Here's the run down: -Great bread and butter to start. -Fried Pickle is also good with perfect texture and crispiness-Smoky Lamb Ribs is perhaps the best dish we ordered, and this is from a guy who avoids ordering lamb in other restaurants. \u00a0The lamb fell off the bone; the sweet and tangy sauce was delicious. -Halibut was pan-seared to achieve the perfect crunch on the exterior while maintaining the moistness of the fish. \u00a0Sauce is light and buttery. While the dish was technically well-executed, it was one to two notes at best. -The Elk was prepared medium-rare and while there is nothing wrong with it, the flavor also fell flat. -Venison burger, juicy and satisfying, was perhaps the second best dish of the evening and definitely worth trying. -Caramelized Lemon Pond Cake and Peanut Butter French Silk Pie (Desserts) also fall into the OK category.

The atmosphere was wonderful and reminded me of what a bar would've appeared like in Chicago in the 1920's/30's. We sat at the bar for a drink while waiting for our table and the bartender was very helpful and created a delicious cucumber martini for my wife. When we were called to be sat down, we asked the bartender for their advice and they shot out two different main course dishes, The Venison Burger and the Elk Chops (I will further explain their excellence shortly). Once we were sat down at our table, our waitress quickly came to the table to see if we needed any drinks. While getting them for us, the bar manager came to the table to introduce himself to us and congratulate us on our recent nuptials (something that isn't often done in the dining industry anymore). After chatting with us, the manager left and the waitress came back with our cocktails and guided us on an appetizer to have, The House Poutine. We ordered that, a dozen oysters, the burger and Elk, as well as a side of carrots served in a chimchurri sauce.First to come out was the House Poutine, and wow is the only word that can describe my reaction. My wife and I gobbled it up due to its deliciousness and were informed by our waitress afterwards that they had won with that dish two years in a row for the Chicago Poutine festival (I believe that 100%). The oysters were extremely fresh and delicious as well, but the real fun came with the main course.The Venison Burger, a first time trying this meat in burger form for my wife and I, was extremely juicy and well cooked and left a great aftertaste in your mouth, the type that makes your mouth water and yearning to have more of what you just ate. The Elk fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. The carrots, (recommendation by our waitress, were so well cooked that they too had that mouth watering effect on the both of us. We finished the meal and needless to say we were stuffed, but we could NOT forget desert :-)We decided on a Peanut Butter French Silk Pie, and one bite made us both look into each others eyes with a feeling of satisfaction. The bar manager returned to see how the meal was and let us know that the dessert was on the house and congratulated us again on our wedding.Fantastic dinner and great service and staff.

It gets a little loud, but the rooms are segregated and it helps.

Perhaps you could request the quieter rooms on Opentable when you make your reservation.As for the food, their menu seems to rotate but we ordered a ton of food and they were all mostly delicious.

Over the weekend, I went to the Art Institute with my mom, starting to get delirious with hunger we knew we needed to get somewhere fast for food, but didn't want to hang around the AI for lunch due to museum fatigue (it's a thing).So, The Gage, being a hop, skip, and a step away from the Art Institute was a great choice. We got in, sat ourselves at the bar, and were able to order and get some drinks quickly. I liked the setup of the bar area, because not only were the stools by the bar up for grabs, but you could seat yourself at any of the bar tables, too. The cocktail menu is pretty small (I think 10 drinks tops). There are a few beers, too, but not as many to choose from as most bars. The wine list is extensive, and so are the scotch and whiskey lists. My mom ended up with a blood orange soda--tasty as well as pretty. Since we decided on curry fries for an appetizer, I felt I had to go with a Guinness. It was a good pour and a good price ($6) so I was happy.The curry fries came in a HUGE bowl. Really, this was a massive serving of fries, and the curry sauce came on the side. My mom and I decided to dip the fries into the sauce, but I think it would have been better if we had poured it over the top of the fries because I wasn't getting as much curry flavor as I would like and as I've had at other bars I've ordered this at.After the fries, my mom feasted on a mushroom and greens warm sandwich with the chicken orzo soup and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. These were so good. I got all the buffalo flavor I wanted from my sandwich and my mom's would be a meal I'd order on a day I wanted something light, but also comforting. These were slam dunks and I ate past the point when I should have stopped because I wanted to be able to fit it all!At the end of the meal, the bill didn't end up being as expensive as I anticipated. The restaurant is probably more expensive for dinner than lunch but I spent no more money here on lunch than I would at, say, DMK (to give an idea, the buffalo chicken sandwich which comes with chips cost $12--at DMK I would get a burger and add on fries for the same price).

For starters, we selected the mussels, oysters, and beet salad. All were superb. The oysters were juicy, and fantastic; the mussels were hearty; the beet salad was crunchy with walnuts, while sweetly paired with sliced apples. We went with the suggested rack of elk, roasted sablefish, and Market Fish of the day, which was Black Cod. My favorite of our entrees is easily the Sablefish. Wow- it was so thick, tender, flavorful, and plentiful. The mushrooms, and greens that accompanied it truly complemented the dish, as well. The rack of elk was very good, and cooked med/rare as preferred. The elk was dense, and satisfying. The Black cod was good, but I wouldn't order it again. I'd recommend trying it for those whom enjoy cod; if you don't prefer white fish, skip it altogether. Lastly, we finished our meals with coffee and lattes (which were decent: neither great or terrible), apple cider doughnuts, and the cranberry spice cake. The doughnuts were my favorite part, sitting beside a melting scoop of maple ice-cream (similar taste to that of butter-pecan-flavored ice-cream). YUM!

We were staying at the Palmer House for a few days and I had read the Yelp raves about 'The Gage' over and over. The menu wasn't tremendously appealing to me, but I saw a few things that caught my eye. Looking for a late-night meal with very few options available, we decided to give it a try. A slight annoyance...I checked their hours online and found a heap of conflicting information. One closing time from Yelp, another from Google, another from their own website. I would generally trust the hours on the restaurant's own website, but the current time was right at their listed closing time. In hopes that perhaps one of the other sources were accurate, I called and found out that none of the sites listing a closing time were correct. Thankfully, that meant we were still able to hop a couple of blocks over for a meal.I worried that we were slightly underdressed (jeans, untucked button-up shirt), but quickly found out that the full spectrum of clientele was being served. Some were in suits and sports coats, others in mangled t-shirts and skinny jeans. We were seated in the main dining area where we might as well have joined another party. The tables were so close together that you could hardly squeeze into the booth side without getting pretty fresh with the folks beside you. The ambience was that of a typical dark, loud, upscale bar in the city. The folks beside us were talking about their Am-Ex Black cards...how exciting! *rolls eyes*From the draft beer menu, I ordered a Blue Moon to drink, but was disappointed a few minutes later when the waitress came back and said they didn't have it. No biggie, I wasn't really feeling like trying something new, so I decided to stick to water. I ordered the Fish and Chips and hubs, who was only in the mood for dessert, ordered the chocolate mousse. The waitress was decent but had a difficult personality to read. It sometimes came across as pretentious, sometimes personable, mostly awkward and sometimes bothered. I'll take the blame and chalk it up to me not feeling super comfortable in with the rich, hipster crowd.My fish and chips came rather quickly (about 10 minutes) in a cute presentation with the fish wrapped in a newspaper cone. The fries were quite good, but the fish wasn't anything spectacular. The fish was moist and flaky and the batter was crispy, but had little flavor. Oddly enough, the cold dessert that hubs ordered at the same time as my entree took considerably longer to come out than my hot entree...they volunteered that the fish and dessert were prepared at different stations (I'd hope so) when they brought the fish out. When it did come out, the chocolate mousse looked great and was served in a mason jar with cookie crumbs layered throughout. Unfortunately, the mousse was very flat and had the consistency of a dense pudding rather than a light and airy mousse. The flavor was that of a brownie batter....you know, when you lick the mixer blades. The ratio of cookie crumbs to mousse was unbalanced, resulting in a very dry dessert.Thankfully, the tables around us started to clear out and we could enjoy a normal conversation. The waitress was very kind to not charge the Am-Ex Black folks beside us for their desserts, making sure they were aware of it before they left their tip. While certainly none of our business, it's hard to ignore in such close proximity...I'm sure they appreciated the favor. When our check came, they tried to charge me for my beer that they did not have. I mentioned it when she took my card and it was removed from the check (no biggie).

The dish came out swimming in a thick orange sauce and the Indian spices hit me right away. The lamb pieces were large, which made it a bit awkward to hack up the meat myself. Also, it seems as though whoever butchered the meat did a sloppy job as many of the bites of lamb were very fatty. The lamb itself had a great smoky flavor to it that was accentuated by the Indian spices in the sauce. There were only a few scant julienned carrots which was also disappointing, and the dish was overpowered by potatoes.

Lots of languid dark wood, polished walnut finishes, traditional nailhead furnishings and dreamy flickering candlelight that all fall within a balanced dichotomy of raucous bar scene in front of the house and sumptuous leather booth filled dining room in back. Take your pick and decide where you want the evening to go... Service in both areas is impeccable, expect to be well taken care of... pampered. From sharp, cheeky bartenders to the knowledgeable yet easygoing waitstaff, The Gage didn't miss a step with my group in either capacity. At the ready to offer up suggestions-a-plenty on the classic gastropub fare menu, I was thankful for assistance... SO. MANY. CHOICES. We went with a smattering of apps, entr\u00e9es and wines (decanted, lovely) and were pleased with almost everything. Allow me to steer you away from the Poached Swan Creek Duck Egg on Mushroom Toast - an over cooked egg combined with thick, meaty mushrooms on utterly uninspiring Texas toast - while offering up the Swan Creek Rabbit P\u00e2t\u00e9 (so lavish) and Scotch Egg (a must try) as far better executed starter options for your tasting pleasure. Fortunately, every single main dish was fawned over... it appears you can't go wrong with any selection. We know the famous Gage Burger with its melty Camembert on a Malt Roll is ooey, gooey fabulosness, but did you know the Braised Lamb Shank with Squash, Fried Artichokes and BBQ Jus is even more delicious?! True! One of the best lamb dishes I've had in some time... Loved it! The only real problem with dining at The Gage was by the end of this veritable feast there was positively no room left for dessert.

You can pick a few small dishes to nibble or do a progression. Having the subtle delineation of first/second/third/fourth to indicate whether a plate is \"snack-sized\" or entr\u00e9e-sized is very helpful when going in a group, especially if the sight of some $40 entr\u00e9es is a bit intimidating.The Gage's wine list begins at a higher price point of around $40. And they have, on occasion, run out of the first wine my group's requested. They have mastered the $12 martini though, especially for a Michigan Ave/Millenium Park spot.There are some perks to being an upscale Elephant and Castle. For starters, they have classic fallbacks that are consistently great. The Gage Burger and Fish and Chips are always satisfying (and on the cheaper end of the entr\u00e9es!) \u00a0The Elk Saddle with ricotta and rhubarb to contrast well as mild salt/sweet, is a superb dinner if you feel like shelling that much out. Unfortunately, saddle's not the only reflection of their elk preparation.Poutine: gravy, cheese curds and fries, with an elk ragout enticing me as a catalyst, disappointed as an oversalted \"snack\". Screwing up salt is always a no-no. As for sides, the brie potato is as rich as it sounds, and nice and crisp. On seconds: I was quickly disillusioned with their Smoked Haddock Cake and Peekytoe Crab. The breading was half salt, while the afterthought of lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche and caviar weren't the best. The mussels with vindaloo are savory and succulent though, and a better seafood pick. Rabbit was seasoned really well, as was the caramelized lobster. Both of these dishes rock this part of the menu.When it came to dessert, the peanut butter beignets immediately drew my eye. I love beignets, and the play on PB&J was charming and effective. French toast? Not so much.With the emergence of so many other gastropubs recently, the Gage has too much volatility in its menu for me to rate it well. It's not even about the unwarrantedly high price point.

I am sad to have to drop The Gage a star. After a wonderful experience last year, I came back for Restaurant Week and I can't say that the menu was its best effort, nor did it impress my out-of-town guest. All the things that wow'ed me the first time came short. The service was rushed and harried. Our server forgot about half the table and brought out food before some had even ordered. I am sure that he was slammed for Restaurant Week, but opportunities like that are ones that get people into your restaurant to become fans. It's not gracious to appear disinterested and bored throughout the meal. I get it. I have a job where I am called to smile and engage even when I am tired or preoccupied. You know what I do? Smile and engage.The Restaurant Week Menu was rather weak. The options were uninspired and definitely not a representation of the best the menu has to offer. I was disappointed to see none of my favorites on the RW menu. The lobster bisque was runny and bland. My fish was 'petitely' portioned... and bland. My dessert was... dessert but entirely unexciting. I found myself wishing I'd just ordered from the regular menu. The thing is, why participate in RW if you're not going to give a d@mn? Offer your good stuff. Impress my guests! Make me look good. As it was, I looked like an idjit for suggesting we come here. I can say that after the service and food at The Gage during RW, there are a few Philadelphians and New Yorkers who will be in no hurry to rush back nor to tell their friends to try it when they come to Chicago. And, that's really too bad because such should not have been the end result.Points to the bus boys, though, for staying the course and being busy bees.

God damnit, this era sucks, I can tell already. So The Gage... it was pricey, with bang up friendly service, but mixed execution on the food. It deserves a 3.5 for a creative menu.Poutine: This was the first poutine I ever tried. I'd get it again here or elsewhere. The Gage's had little bits of elk meat in the gravy, consistent with the rest of the menu's exotic offerings (antelope tartar, saddle of elk, fried bald eagle, braised baby seal, tuna net dolphin carpaccio, etc.)Mussels (in vindaloo sauce): Not bad. Not amazing. Sorry, that's all I got. Scallops: Served with something else that gave them an interesting smoky flavor. I only had a bit of one, but I'm not sure I could eat a whole lot of this dish. The smokiness was a tad overpowering. Risotto of the day: Since I've become a bit of a risotto slut in recent months, I had to ask our server about this dish. Turns out it was broccoli rabe, salsify, and radish. It sounded a bit bitter, but the server assured me it wasn't. He was right, but I'm still not sure it was a proper vegetable pairing for risotto. The plating of the dish was abysmal though, which kind of troubled me. Granted there aren't too many ways to put damp rice on a dish, but this looked like the lunch lady in the cafeteria with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth slopped a bunch of mystery food on a plate and passed it over the counter to me. There was no garnish (outside of the radish which I believe was left raw), nor any grated parmesan offered. Coffee and Doughnuts dessert: Again, a rather original idea that could have been better. Small dark chocolate profiteroles arrived in a dish. The waiter poured the \"coffee\" on top of them tableside. The coffee was a creamy, sweet, coffee-flavored sauce. It sounded excellent, but fell a little short in the flavor department. I also had a cup of real coffee, which was magnificent. I had to ask the waiter what they were brewing. Turns out it was Julius Meinl. Damn you Julius!

Last night, I had the opportunity to cover more culinary ground than on my last three visits combined. We had:Scotch egg: A-. Well done, big and beautiful! I especially liked the coarse mustard as a compliment to the yolk. And pork? Bravo. Chips: A. Classic Irish fries with curry gravy. The fries are perfectly golden with a nice crispy yet chewy inside.

It's not listed on their website menu, but you'll see it under first or second courses on the printed menu when in the restaurant. The meat has a really rich taste despite being low fat. Who knew? And The Gage sources their goat from a very well-respected farmer (wish I remembered the name).Also, I should mention I was really set on trying the glorious poutine but our server had other plans for us. Though our service was top notch and very involved, I was a bit turned off by the pushiness (i.e. we don't want a bottle of wine, so please don't go ahead and order it for us, okay?). What I did want to drink, however, was two different pints of pumpkin beer (both on draught). One was by Dogfish and the other was so new it hadn't made the menu yet.For my main course, I had 'The Gage' burger. Though the Gage has a plethora of beautiful offerings (Elk! Locally crafted sausages! Gunthorp Farms pork chop!), I had a huge craving for beef and knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I ordered it medium rare which I hardly ever do, but knew I could here. It was cooked to my exact specifications (extra, extra juicy) and topped with local Camembert and melted onion marmalade. Brilliant combination! In fact, I liked my burger so much that I ate the whole thing (which, isn't easy).

The Gage made planning for this event incredibly easy and accommodated a group of 20 of us neatly, and with very little notice (and multiple changes even two days before our arrival), all with terrific service and a welcoming disposition. They didn't think twice about breaking their own seating rule by allowing my handicapped mother to sit before our party arrived, and then filled us in as our group slowly made our way in. Food has always been fantastic here, and on this beautiful Sunday I followed my usual pattern by ordering a sandwich. I have never been disappointed by their sandwiches, and this time I had their Gunthorp Farms Pork sandwich. It is massive- served on a ciabatta roll, accompanied by melted brie, cabbage slaw and mustard- it is hardy, yet the flavors come through.

The Gage is classy, lots of dark wood, charming little rooms full of tables, tablecloths and a charming Irishman at the front of the house who can speak a little French too (he made the birthday girl swoon)! Located right across from Millennium Park and the Art Institute it's a great spot to grab a bite; it won't be a cheap meal, but in my opinion it's worth it. I ordered the grilled albacore sandwich and the rest of our table ordered mussels, potatoes with brie, fish and chips, the regular burger, mixed lettuce salad and chicken and giant noodle soup. Everyone seemed very happy with their meals and the portions are very generous. Per my co-workers the fish and chips were very light and fresh. If you order the mussels bring your appetite, they give you enough for two; my friend shared some of her mussels with us and still couldn't make a sizable dent. The mussels were large and tasty, I loved them over the spicy vindaloo sauce.My sandwich, served with fries, was seared albacore with pickled onion, horseradish aioli, lettuce and green beans on a roll. It was quite good, but also quite messy. I think it would've been a lot easier to eat if they eased up on the lettuce; I also think the lettuce distracted from some of the other flavors. Service was attentive and friendly, we never wanted for a refill and our food came quickly. Lunch gets pretty busy so I would make reservations, unless you want to risk a wait.

There's something cozy about it, and it's a great late night spot for drinks. It's great for drinks anytime, really, but late night was my favorite time to be there. The food isn't anything spectacular, but I did love the smoked salmon appetizer and the fish & chips, and the burgers.

I'm guessing they discontinued that dish because diners were immediately rushed to the ER for a bypass after consuming.I really went there for the drinking scene and the drinks themselves.

The Gage doesn't look very large from the foyer; however, the journey to our table revealed a few connected rooms, all crammed to the max with tables and chairs. The decor is rich, dark, and manly - a space you'd expect to see classy 1920 mobster kings smoking cigars.Our experience at The Gage was all about indulgence. We were greeted first by the chef, who discussed their Check Please appearance and also made recommendations of his favorite dishes. We took him very seriously and ordered them all. That made the job of \u00a0Augustus (our server) pretty simple; however, he still shone with poise and kind attention to our every chance eye-contact. In fact, when we asked for more dipping bread for our mussels, we were presented with four more large pieces - far more than we wanted. Augustus accidentally treated us to an extra cocktail for \"the table\" and did not charge us. See? Indulgence.In all, we ordered the following:Basil Escargot - Not your typical escargot. The Gage took those little snails out of their buttery homes and sandwiched them between hazelnut cookies with goat cheese for a dish that completely reconstructed my understanding of escargot. It was a little difficult to share (see my picture) as cutting the presentation in two caused an unsightly mess on the plate.Mussels - M loved them. She said that she caught hints of salty sea water in the savory little bits. I liked the soft texture of the meats and the broth. For the price and quality, we got a HUGE portion. The two of us could not finish all of them.Crisp Rabbit Salad - This was our mutual favorite dish of the evening. It was simple arugula with a light mustard dressing over a bed of shredded rabbit. The greens were topped with crisp, pure white, puffed rice pearls that added a perfect amount of delicate crunch to the salad. We had the chef divide the salad onto two plates for us, which ended up being perfect portions.Maple Leaf Farms Duck Roasted Breast and Confit - This was a surprising comfort-food dish. The clove flavor shone through the pudding and lent a nice spiciness to the richness of the duck. There were actually two types of duck meat: breast and leg. The breast was served in seven thick slices on top and the leg was shredded underneath. M thought that the shredded meat was rabbit at first (after enjoying the Crisp Rabbit Salad), but Augustus kindly explained that it was all duck. I must say that we were both distended by the time we got to this final dish and did not have the hunger to properly enjoy it.We also had wine, the Old Fashioned no. 24, and Irish Coffee. The Old Fashioned no. 24 tasted watery from the generous pour of ginger ale but was still good. I liked the dried cherries at the bottom. The Irish Coffee wasn't sweet enough for me, but I enjoyed the presentation of a thick layer of cream on top of dark coffee. When drinking it, the cream bumped my lip and mixed with the hot coffee on it's path to my mouth.Our entire bill came to about $130 (if I remember correctly). M commented that it wasn't nearly as expensive as she expected it to be, especially considering all of our alcohol. We think our sharing all of our dishes had a lot to do with the final price.The single most reason why neither Melinda nor I would give a full five stars to The Gage is because it was so incredibly crowded. We were there at 5:00 PM and the place became completely full soon afterward. Other tables were very close to us and the physical space was difficult to navigate when entering or exiting or table (when using the loo for example).

I am not really the biggest fan of what the area has to offer. Alas, my girlfriend had a voucher for discounted Amtrak tickets that she had to actually go to Union Station in order to use, which is quite annoying. Oddly enough, she received the voucher due to Amtrak being pretty horrible and delaying her train by some god-awful-ridiculous length of time and her having to call and complain. Their answer, \"Sorry. Here is a voucher for a discount on a future train ticket, but in order to use it you have to come down to Union Station and stand in line forever only to be waited on by our charming staff that we have recruited from a pool of ex-postal employees.\" And so we found ourselves in the Loop on a Friday evening.I did some research to try and find somewhere interesting to go for dinner. We decided upon The Gage, mostly because I love when restaurants use game meats and I am a big fan of things like house-made sausages, rillettes, and most of all foie gras. We did not make reservations and it was a Friday evening, so I did have a back-up plan just in case. We arrived and were told it would be an hour or we could try the bar, which is first come, first serve. Being it was our first time here, I opted to wait the hour and get a table in the dining area. So we went and hung out in Millennium Park for a while to waste some time.We came back to The Gage and were seated fairly quick. The food menu was a little strange in layout, but everything on it sounded delicious. The drink menu was quite nice. Tasty cocktails, good wine, and a pretty good beer list with selections from Three Floyd's, Unibroue, Dogfish Head, Two Brothers, and several more, including a couple of British beers I am unfamiliar with.Getting down to the main reason we came to The Gage, I will discuss the food. It was very good. The House Poutine, which was my first poutine, was awesome. Fries, gravy, cheese curds, elk... Heaven. The fondue was also very delicious. Next, we tried the goose, foie gras, and duck rillettes. It was the best. I have had rillete at my school. I have made rillete myself. And I had the rillette at The Bristol, which was very good, but this was the best. And the presentation was great. To finish off the night, I had the locally crafted sausages, which were very good, and my girlfriend had \"The Gage\" burger, which was also good, but too big. And actually, my only real complaint about The Gage was the portion sizes. I am sure that most people think it is wonderful and a lot of people in this country feel that if they can move after their meal then they got ripped off, but I am starting to disagree, as of late. I much prefer feeling like I could eat a little more, but shouldn't, than feel stuffed to capacity.

I had just helped my friend Mike pick out an engagement ring for his now wife, and after the fact he needed a strong drink. We wandered over to The Gage, having no idea what it was, and bellied up to the bar. It was a Tuesday or Wednesday night around 6:30 and the place was empty. The bartender was friendly, we took a bunch of shots of Jameson, and ordered some appetizers. I had the fondue, he had the infamous egg. The fondue was great--the egg scared me so I did not try it because I thought I would have a heart attack on the spot if I did. I noted that this was a place to definitely come back to for a low key happy hour. But after last night, I am thinking that our experience back last September was because the place was still new and perhaps a bit unknown...Last night (a Friday) two friends and I headed to The Gage, right at 5:00. We walked in and couldn't believe how crowded the place was. The bar area was packed, so much so that we had to slither through one at a time to get to the back area, which was slightly more clear. It took forever to get our drinks ($8 Absolut & sodas that seemed not to have a drop of alcohol in them). The bartender was the kind of asshole you expect at John Barleycorn--did not utter a word, looked at me like my drink order was annoying to him, and did not crack a smile or even make an attempt at making me feel as though I mattered.

I lost my appetite.My partner was not thrilled with his sandwich either, which, while cooked thoroughly, was also extremely greasy. \u00a0And the brie potatoes seemed like they had pretty much been pre-prepared, frozen, and then nuked prior to being served.Kind of like a High Class ... Bennigans!.Again, not being the kind of person who wants to let a bad meal upset my applecart, I called the waiter over, and explained the situation. \u00a0He seemed to be very understanding and called the manager over. \u00a0They did offer to bring me something else, but at this point I politely explained I was no longer hungry and if they wanted to compensate me, it would be appreciated if they took the hamburger off the bill. \u00a0They agreed to this.However, this is where I'm pretty sure the service at Bennigans exceeds Gage.... my partner, who felt bad about my bad meal, offered to pay and grabbed the check as soon as it arrived \u00a0I asked him if I could see the check to make sure the $13 patty of peppercorn and lightly seared ground beef I was served was comped, but he handed the check and credit card were handed back to the waiter on the spot and run. \u00a0The tip was left and we left quickly, a little embarassed by the whole incident (I hate confronting waiters in situations like that and almost never send anything back, but the price was just way too high to deal with poorly prepared food). \u00a0Out on the street I asked how much the check was. \u00a0I was amazed when we realized that on top of everything else, we had NOT actually been comped, and had paid $60 w/ tip for 2 poorly cooked sandwiches, a couple of sides, and one drink.Maybe it's just me, but I've spoken casually with others who have tried this place and experienced lousy service and average food as well. \u00a0All of which makes me wonder how many \"real\" reviews there are here vs. friends and acquaintances of staff (see the review about getting drink tabs picked up).Regardless, I call this one \"OFF THE LIST!\" \u00a0:)", "Date": "2007-05-28", "Author_Location": "Jacksonville Beach, FL"}, {"Author": "P W.", "ReviewID": "W2jH34uAq5HliPUDKGuGFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My friends and I had a pretty wild time in Chicago.

I'm on the fence about that. I've been here twice now, both times for lunch. I think my second experience (which was today with my coworkers) was better than the first back in Feb 2008. Today I had the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich. The beef was very tender and kept falling off my fork. The sandwich is huge and open face, so you have to eat it with a knife and fork. The greens on top balanced out what I thought was possibly over kill on some of the other flavors. Here were the issues:1. You couldn't even taste the bread because it was so hidden under everything else. I think good bread makes a sandwich and adds texture. 2. The mustard, while good (I LOVE mustard) was overpowering and not evenly distributed, so every other bite I got a mouth full of it. 3. There was almost too much cheese (and I didn't think that was possible) but it and the mustard make the bread soggy. It was enjoyable for the most part, and I'm not terribly picky about food, but I'm trying to be more refined with my reviews, so that's my two cents. My boss got the Peppered hanger steak salad and it came with AWESOME presentation and look like it was a little more balanced than my pile of sandwich, so maybe I just picked the wrong thing.

In my previous visit I had the Gage burger, and that was yummy as far as I remember, but suffered from some of the same textural/soggy bread issues as my sandwich did today. That said: OMG have dessert! We got a couple things and shared. The peanut butter beignets were amazing. I was skeptical of the blueberry jam and strawberry ice cream that came with, but it was all awesome together. The pound cake was also good and so is the gelato. The atmosphere, I really like. The green tiles on the walls are cool, and they have adequate space to accommodate large parties. The only thing was that even at lunch it was really loud in there. A busy dinner night may be deafening. The service was good this time around. We had a reservation and were dressed for work, and I honestly think that got us better service. When I was there with a younger friend on a Sunday afternoon I felt a little rushed and treated like I didn't know how to act in a restaurant. I'm hyper-sensitive about being treated like an adult because, duh, I am one. So yeah, it's a good lunch place.

Had the roast \u00a0chicken, wasn't impressed, and said so. I also said I'd never go back, unless someone else was footing the bill.Well, \"never\" is a strong word, one that, once used, usually requires revision. In this case, to \"as often as is feasible.\"The revised Gage review:I revisited The Gage recently with a friend who'd come to town for the weekend. We stopped in for drinks early on a Friday evening, and, intrigued by the menu and enamored of the Ginger Fizz and Belle de Brillet cocktails, decided to return the following day for lunch.I'll gloss over the niceties of interior decor: dark, shiny, well-appointed without being stuffy in the least. Now. Lunch. Repeat Belles de Brillet (me) and a nice rose (friend). Add Scotch egg for first course. \u00a0Hard boiled egg ensconced within sausage meat, breaded and deep fried? Genius. And well-executed by the Gage, served on a bed of greens, with stone-ground mustard on the side. We followed that with the seared scallop salad and a sandwich of rib eye on ciabatta with smoked cheddar and grilled red onion. My gluten-intolerant friend loved her salad. I didn't have the heart to swipe a bite from someone already so deprived, so I had to take her word for it. Now that I've had the Gage rib-eye sandwich, I'm rather inclined to abandon all other meat/bread/cheese combinations as hopelessly inferior. (Given the breadth of my hips and the dearth of my Gage-ready funds, this is undoubtedly for the best.)We finished the meal with coffee and the chocolate torte dessert--brick of insanely rich, bittersweet chocolate ganache, balanced by a salty pub pretzel in a cloud of whipped cream and an artful (translation: more, please!) smear of stout sabayon. Friend's gluten-policing did not, alas, survive this course, and I was forced to share. Our server (Cayden, I think) was wonderful, and I believe the owner was circulating and checking diners' satisfaction, so we always felt attended to, but never rushed. It was a wonderful dining experience.And so The Gage gets another star. I've since recommended it to anyone within earshot, not that they need my word-of-mouth. By now, most of Chicago has realized it's a gem. But I feel guilty for having dismissed it so readily after my first visit. I'm reserving that fifth star for my repeat bout with the Amish chicken, though.***** (Original review below)I firmly believe you can tell the quality of a cook by their mastery of roast chicken, perhaps the simplest, yet most perfect of dishes.Can you tell by the star rating how I feel about the Amish roast chicken at The Gage? (Underseasoned, uninteresting, uninspiring.)The service is friendly and good, the pub itself is rather polished and modern, and the menu indicates the joint is trying to pull off upmarket, gastropub fare, but I wasn't at all impressed with my meal or the prices. If someone else were footing the bill, I'd go to see if the cooks were just having an off night in the kitchen the day I went.

I was nowhere near hungry after those and a couple of beers, but was told that I \"simply cannot leave without dessert\". I'm not one for sweets, but the waitress said that the baklava, fig and Greek yogurt drizzled with honey and almonds basically made the other deserts look like a scoop of vanilla ice cream, so I tried it. For someone who doesn't like sweets, I finished every bite.

I'd never been there myself but was pleased with the choice. Right within reach of the Art Institute, Millennium Park and other attractions in the Loop, the Gage occupies prime real estate on Michigan Avenue. Inside was dim, with glassed-in, separate rooms to make for quieter dining (although one diner in ours felt the need to talk at top volume). Our server, Zachary, was young but polished (though he initially startled me by lighting the tea candle for our table right in the corner of my peripheral vision) and did a fine job accomodating us and the other tables in the area with grace and balance. May I mention the food! The Gage has a whiff of the gastropub about it but isn't pretentious about the food (in other words, it doesn't arrive as a deconstruction or a tower, blasted with CO2 or in miniscule portion). I ordered the red wine roasted Amish chicken with cream-braised salsify (a root vegetable similar to parsnips), which was delicious, though the chicken came with some unnecessary, undressed baby greens on top that were either an overgrown garnish or an unfinished salad. \u00a0The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the salsify a surprise hit, tender and decadent with the cream. My friend had fish and chips, of which I had a bite: serviceable, not soggy, though with all the other wonderful-looking things to choose from on this menu this wouldn't have been my personal first pick.The one issue we had with dinner was the plates. Both of our meals came in oddly-shaped plates that were hard to cut in/on. Mine was an oval ramekin, several inches deep, which held the chicken and salsify; cutting down into this, especially maneuvers like slicing chicken off the bone, was awkward in this setup. My friend had a shallow rectangular dish for her fish and chips, but it had a lip that she kept hitting as she cut, which was difficult not to bump and made for slow going.For dessert we selected orange creme brulee; its sugar surface was perhaps just slightly undercaramelized (you didn't quite get the crisp crack but rather a bit of a bend to the spoon tip), but the intense orange scent and flavor were intoxicating. From the cocktail menu, I sampled the Gage Old Fashioned, which contained candied ginger and (oddly) nuts -- like, whole almonds floating in the glass. The ginger flavor intensified as I got to the bottom of the glass. Intriguing.The Gage was a good find for downtown dining.

I was absolutely blown away by their 3-course Restaurant Week menu. Where many restaurants simply take the event for granted and some actually seem to increase their prices to take advantage of unsuspecting diners, The Gage has simply done the opposite. The $22 lunch menu was superb. I started with a celery root puree served with a light, bite sized biscuit, horseradish gougere, and garnished with pork confit. First off, the serving was surprisingly large. I expected a cup of soup, they served me a large bowl. Often restaurants will prepare this type of soup too densely and attempt to thicken the base with cream, not so here it was a beautifully light with a texture that reminded you of the fresh coarseness of celery. A superb start to our meal.I ordered the whitefish for my entree. The whitefish was pan fried with the skin left on and lightly seasoned with sea salt. \u00a0The fish was served with rye gnocchi, on a bed of whole leave spinach and topped with seaweed with smoked onion cream sauce and garnished with pousse-pied (sea green bean seaweed). I don't think anyone is capable of doing whitefish better, the fish was incredibly fresh and cooked perfectly; tender, but retaining the firmness of the filet. The gnocchi was homemade with a soft texture and added a welcome contrast to the dish. The pousse-pied on top was just a spectacular and creative touch that added a salty, crunchy dimension that, combined with the oils in the crispy fish skin, created a beautiful juxtaposition reminiscent of fine dining, not a urban gastropub. And did I mention this meal was only $22?We finished the meal off with panettone crips with anise caramel sauce and what tasted like cream cheese ice cream. The dessert was simply delicous the panettone crips were displayed a nutty and moderately dense texture and were complimented well with the more caramel than anise sauce. The ice cream was dense with a smooth, richness that lingered after each panettone bite. For lack of a better term, this dessert was like eating cake and ice cream on steroids!On top of that the service was flawless, and we were in and out in a perfect amount of time for a work lunch. Overall, I thought there wasn't a single thing that they could have done better.

Delicious sauce, perfectly cooked, CRISPY skin HELLO! \u00a0Served with white asparagus, which I think is kinda gross, but who cares, The duck was amazing.Also try the whitefish, very light and simple, but flavorful and delicious. The pork chop, I also heard from my dining mate, was delicious, but it has this \"smokey malto-dextrin powder\" on it according to our server, which is supposed to give it a bbq/right off the grill flavor. \u00a0 UMMM, how about you guys just put it on the grill and give it that bbq flavor, that's unsettling. \u00a0Oh well, the guy eating it loved it and loved the maltodextrin-aliciousness of it. \u00a0Go figure.All in all, I would PROBABLY come back, I mean the entrees were super good, if I was in the area, but really wouldn't take extra effort to go there specifically. \u00a0Figure out the kinks in your wait-staff. \u00a0They get thumbs up for the sustainable, local ingredients.", "Date": "2010-10-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jody G.", "ReviewID": "wDHGRRECwmKhmoslexRHbQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Okay.... okay.....before you read any further you must realize that this review was written by ME.... not some wild boar or venison, or even scotch egg eating kind of person. \u00a0I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches off of paper towels at lunchtime and macaroni and cheese right out of the pot with a spoon while I watch the 6 o'clock news. \u00a0I'm just not a fancy-schmancy person.That said, I was very comfortable here. \u00a0The place is warm and inviting without being stuffy. \u00a0And, the lunch menu is quite complete.

My family is quite traditional when it comes to their tastes, so to no surprise the table was littered with Burgers and Fish and chips. I tried everything and thought the burgers were flavorless, as if they took the ground beef, pan fried it and served as is. The fish and chips were nice and flaky and the fires were perfect.We also tried the brie fondue which was forgettable and the mussels weren't anything special. Hits of the evening include the Caramelized Lobster which tasted absolutely decadent, Sweet and savory in a Lemon Quinoa. So yummy I could eat three orders and be happy! Also the Braised Rabbit Salad with crisp rice, spicy robiola lettuce and a very light Horseradish vinaigrette. The rabbit was cooked perfectly and the flavors were exceptional. This was a waitress recommended dish and she also recommended the Elk which I regretfully didn't get.

I want to steal the sink and take it home with me.I ordered the Fish and Chips and they were quite good. Not as good as I've had in Ireland, but very good. There was so much on the menu to choose from, I really think I could have been happy with anything. Other guests found something they like--burgers, salads, seafood, and were happy as well.What I REALLY want to rec is this place for brunch. First off, you can make reservations so you are not waiting outside or for your tiny table for an hour. Second, the food was incredible. We made a reservation and were seated outside on a beautiful Chicago Fall Day. I ordered the seasonal omelette that came with the most amazing crisp brie potatoes I've ever had. Mixing brie with potatoes? GENIUS! My friends had an amazing grilled chicken salad served with cous scous and watermelon. I love an interesting salad at a restaurant. The buckwheat waffles were also delish.I must say the service on this specific day was one of the best I've had. Our waitress was prompt and helpful. And the manager came around to ask us how our dining experience was and was very present in the restaurant during the time we we were there. Our entire bill was under 50$ for 3 people with a drink and the meals, I really think that's reasonable. My entree itself was $10!To those complaining about the price, you can definitely take a jog over to D4 Irish Pub or down the way into the South Loop to Grace O'Malley's for some pub grub. This is indeed a nice step up! Its all about perception. If you go in thinking you're going to get a dollar burger and some drafts for $10, you're going to think its expensive. If you are thinking of it as a grown up version of an Irish pub or better yet a quasi fine dining experience, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "2010-09-13", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Richard O.", "ReviewID": "Z1PK0FErhSp4Ujgd4bwSxA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I met my boyfriend in the bar here after a class I was taking up the road.

The gnudi, sort of like gnocchi but not made out of potatoes, was good, but maybe not $19 good. The mushrooms, fiddleheads, and peas were very fresh though and the parmesan broth generally brought it all together.The beignets were sinful.

My fianc\u00e9e and I went to a wine tasting nearby and decided to grab dinner afterwards. We called the Gage and were able to get a table right away even though they were very busy. I was skeptical about the entire idea of The Gage given that it's on Michigan Avenue. Shouldn't a restaurant on Michigan Avenue either be geared for tourists, or overpriced, or both?! Let's just say I was happily proven to be oh so very wrong. The decor is dominated by dark wood and white and black ceramic tiles which gives it a 1920s steakhouse feel... kind of like Keen's in New York, but without the feeling that it hasn't been renovated since 1920.The drinks were fantastic. I ordered a gin gimlet, a simple drink but one that most bartenders screw up by making it simply a lime juice cocktail where you can barely taste the gin. The bartenders at The Gage would not sink to such levels, their gimlet was delicious. The service was attentive and knowledgeable and the waiter helped us navigate the menu to find dishes that he felt were special at The Gage and that would suite our tastes.So... now we get to the food. We ate WAY too much because it was so delicious. I can't remember the full menu, but our meal focused on the meats. We started with the Poutine with Elk Ragout and the Scotch Egg. I hadn't even heard of either of these dishes before this evening, but thanks to Yelp reviews that suggested both, we went for it. Thank goodness we did. I've never tasted anything like either before and have no idea where we could even get something similar. \u00a0Both were unique and incredibly delicious. If you have to choose though, I'd go with Poutine... but plan a workout for the day after to work off the cheese/gravy/meat/french fry combination. I've already written too much so I'll stop here.

How fancy!!The Irish flexing their culinary skills in a 3 million dollar gastropub = great success. \u00a0For those of you not in-the-know, a gastropub is basically food that you would find in some divey murky pub in the backroads of Ireland, but classier ingredients are used and the food is presented as upscale. [It's where rich people go to eat expensive comfort food, basically] You don't need to be dressed up to be a patron of this fine establishment, but you'll feel more awesome, so throw on a suit or some heels. Most of the people in here during the lunch hours are business men drinking martinis and beer - or the real housewife variety... or college kids like myself, being taken on a hot lunch \"date\" by their rich uncle. HANDS DOWN the best fish & chips you will ever eat out of a roll of newsprint this side of the Atlantic. Fantastic burgers and interesting takes on classic sandwiches [I had the olive oil poached hawaiian tuna sandwich... I was thinking tuna-steak, not tuna salad... but it was lovely. yes, lovely]. ++'s = they have scotch eggs. SCOTCH EGGS. I dare you to find a fancy restaurant with a Scotch Egg. If you're reading this review and you often visit fancy restaurants, you probably don't know what that even is! They have curry chips [fries]... traditional Irish street food.--'s = For my sandwich being 16 dollars, I wish they had done something a little more interesting. High quality ingredients, yes, but not huge on flavor. fun facts : the bar was built in Ireland and shipped overseas by the owner, who's son now runs the bar. Billy Jr will be the one walking around asking about the food... he likes to make the rounds and make sure that everything is quality. So overall, it's a fun place to spend some money on food so delicious you'd have to travel to Ireland to get it.

I dug the old school decor; I felt comfortable in a polo, shorts and high tops; and the crowd seemed jovial enough. Items were a bit pricey, but not obnoxiously so. I got the \"Gage Fizz\" cocktail... I had mixed feelings as to whether I really liked it or if it tasted like a bad scotch and soda with a packet of 'Sugar in the Raw' at the bottom, so I quickly moved into a delightful Sommelier-recommended Grenache/Syrah blend. I'm trying to lose weight, so we had the Scotch Egg (hard boiled egg encased in deep-fried sausage) as an opener. Greasy and good. More Scotch food please!I wanted to get the chicken and giant noodle soup, because I love giant things, but we went straight to main course options: I had the Hangar Steak with Goat Cheese Grits and Cabernet Stilton-Butter.

I suppose we should have assumed/asked, but he struck the Crisp Brie Potato from our tab without being asked to do so then disappeared as unobtrusively as he'd materialized.

When we walked in the restaurant, which was around 5:30pm, we were told it was going to be a 2 1/2 hour wait without reservation! Luckily, we were also told that we could go downstairs where there was a bar and order food. After making our way through the crowded upstairs bar, we found the stairs to the basement bar. I was surprised at how nice it was down below. And how empty. We found a table right away and ordered food and drinks. Apparently, we got there at the right moment because by the end of our meal the downstairs bar was packed. Okay, let's talk about the food. We started off with the Gage Fondue appetizer. According to the menu, the cheese filling was made of butter kaase, brie and spinach. It's served with long strips of toast. And it was fantastic. The folks sitting next to us saw us enjoying ours and ordered one for themselves. There seems to be a lot of recommendations for the Scotch Egg. But if you're with a party where you don't know if everyone is going to be down with eating an egg for an appetizer, you might want to look into the Fondue. For dinner, the wife got the fish and chips. \u00a0Like many others I'm sure, we had seen the Metromix piece about the fish and chips and wanted to try them out. My wife, who has tired multiple fish and chips dishes around the city, ranked them up with the best. If you didn't catch the TV piece, the fish and chips are wrapped in a newspaper. Check out the photo I've added. I got the prime burger with blue cheese, and it was one of the best burgers I have had in this city. And the chips or fries were extremely tasty as well although they give you way more than you could possibly eat. My only complaint for The Gage is the price. $17 for fish and chips?!? $16 for a burger?!? Come on! Still, I knew beforehand of the extreme prices so I wasn't shocked. However, the inflated prices will certainly deter me from making The Gage a regular spot.

I ordered a giant, fancy beer, my date ordered gin on the rocks along with The Scottish Egg and the delicious french fries and elk dish in a rich, goupy sauce. \u00a0Everything was yummy and hearty which was great on that particular rainy day. \u00a0at one point our busser was about to refill my glass of water just at the same time I was about to put my giant beer in the giant goblet down after taking a sip. \u00a0Some how, the pitcher that the busser was holding SMASHED into my beer goblet! \u00a0I was in a brief shock until I found myself soaking wet - beer was all over me. \u00a0I realized that my hand was holding the beer goblet and I fearfully looked down at my hand - IT WAS SAFE! \u00a0not a single cut. \u00a0The server, the management, everyone handled it so well. \u00a0Immediately got us a new table, a new beverage and they comped our appetizers! \u00a0The manager came and sat with us, they were fantastic at handling the calamity. Back to the food! \u00a0I had the salmon, it was a lunch special and it was awesome! \u00a0I usually don't even like salmon but our nice, over sized server convinced me to order the salmon (after some prodding). \u00a0My fearless companion ordered the rib eye sandwich, he was disappointed but I just think it was a bad choice on his part. \u00a0We also had a side of the spaghetti squash with goat cheese which we both enjoyed. \u00a0We ordered dessert, split one dessert, I cannot remember what it was but I know my date liked it more than I did.

Near the top of her list was The Gage. After spending the day at the Shedd, my friend and I figured we'd drop by The Gage for dinner before catching the Metra back to the suburbs.We were not disappointed. I suspected we'd be in good hands when we sat down and our server reminded us that the chef was a recent regional James Beard award nominee. We started with an order of the duck fat nuts and the famous Scotch egg. The nuts weren't anything too special. I guess I had hoped the duck fat would give them a richer flavor, but it was too subtle to really justify the price tag. I'd probably skip these next time.But that Scotch egg was great. The breading outside was light and crispy, and one cut in with my knife revealed the crumbly yolk. The combination of the sausage and the egg was like brunch for dinner. And the accompanying whole-grain mustard was a nice touch. Next, we tried the basil escargot. The snails were lightly fried with basil, giving them a light crispness and unique flavor that paired nicely with the natural earthiness of escargot and the goat cheese fonduta underneath. But the real star of the dish was the light crunch of the hazelnut crisp on top. It gave the savory dish just a hint of sweetness and a unique texture pairing.We also tried the seared scallops. These were cooked perfectly--that beautiful touch of caramelization on the outside and tender meat inside. The accompanying apple and watercress salad was nice, especially when I got a bite with the beet pur\u00e9e. The touch of horseradish was unexpected, but really brought all the flavors together.My friend and I split the special risotto of the day--a vegetarian mix with rapini and cheese. I think we should probably have stuck with appetizers--the risotto felt a little too safe and expected after eating such unique flavor combinations in our appetizers. Plus, the rice was a little undercooked for my tastes. After such delicious savory food, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try dessert, even though I was admittedly already a little stuffed. We ordered the chocolate ganache and caramel tartlet and the gingered beignets. The chocolate tartlet wasn't anything too special--your basic chocolate tart with sweet caramel crumbles on top--but the accompanying toasted milk ice cream was delicious! It was so rich and creamy, with such simple, yet sophisticated, flavor.The gingered beignets were easily my favorite bite of the entire dinner. The dough was light and gently fried. The ginger ice cream and peach jam made for a great pairing, just the right touch of spice and heat.Service was attentive, even with a full house. Water glasses were promptly refilled and our server was ready and eager to answer any questions we had about the menu.

Thus this review is much over due. My bf decided to take me out for a day on the town and to start he wanted me to try The Gage. It was pretty easy to get to as it's right on MI and not too far from the Red Line stop.I really didn't know what to expect as it's an \"Irish Pub.\" This place definitely isn't like a \"typical\" Irish Pub. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! We didn't have a reservation, but got a table right away, although it was 1:30PM on a Saturday... The place was pretty packed and it seemed like every table as filled. Let's get to the best part.. THE FOOD. Even though it was already 1:30 in the afternoon, I decided to order off their brunch menu. I got the eggs benedict w/ rasher (Irish bacon). WOW!!! It was probably one of the best eggs benedicts I've ever had. It was overly salty and the eggs were cooked to perfect - not over done at all! The potato hash that it was served with was also cooked very nicely. I normally don't finish my entire plate, but I was ready to lick this one clean! My bf got got the famous Fish & Chips. The waiter also mentioned that their version of the Fish & Chips was voted the best in the city. I was a bit skeptical when she mentioned that, but when I took a bite I could see why it was voted \"Best Fish & Chips\" in the city! If you have been to restaurant before and didn't try the Fish & Chips, go back to get one! You are missing out! The prices were decent as well since they are on Michigan Ave after all. I thought $12 for Eggs Benedict was very reasonable for a fantastic restaurant located on MI Ave. We also ordered the desert. I can't tell you exactly what it was so needless to say I wasn't very impressed. I think I would skip the desert next time and order more drinks! :) I can't wait for the next time I go back to this restaurant and taste their delicious food!

Bottomline: Surprised, in a good way. I have been passing this place, writing it off as another mag mile tourist hole.

One of the managers (owners) stopped by and chatted briefly without shilling his own place and \u00a0commented that they try to keep the draft list interesting with lots of small or local infusion to the mix.Specifically for brunch, I was shocked to get a reservation on a Sunday morning, given how crowded it was in the afternoon last I had been there. It was pretty empty at 10:30ish, but slowly added people towards noon. So, little worries on getting a seat if you're running into long waits at Yolk a bit further South on Michigan. I had the Buckwheat Waffles + Ricotta Cheese. Oh, and a side of Irish Bacon. Simple, very good, but quite cheesy. Large portion for what you're paying. Had a Bloody Caesar which was not so great. I've been hooked on these for a long time, and while the Gage gets bonus points for bumping up the horseradish, the overall drink was thin and watery. Too much lime juice, too little tomato.

My fiance's sausages were delicious. I had a bite of one and it might have been a spicy chicken?

There are upstairs and downstairs bars and each is bursting with table tops and small tables. The menu is great. Its sectioned up by 'courses', but it appeared that most orderd/shared food tapas style. We ordered the Duck Egg on Mushroom toast, the Fried Chicken Livers and the Mussels in Vindaloo. Everything was absolutely fantastic. \u00a0The portions are quite big. I would say the first course items (\"snacks\" as they call them), are a nice sized apppetizer. The \"first course\" items are a dish in themselves. Other things: service was friendly. Our waitress was also the bar tender so it wasn't the quickest service. However, she did a nice job for being the only employee in that area. I had only ONE thing to complain about. The beer prices for Belgian beers. Okay, I know prices for imported Belgian beers like Kwak and Chimay will be pricey. I'm use to seeing the prices for about $7-10, that's common. But $14 Belgian beer? The house wine prices were also extremely pricey. The high alcohol prices probably correlates with the location of the restaurant, but still, $14? \u00a0So overall, VERY big fan of their food.

I really truly do. Its within blocks from my condo, its got a nice atmosphere, and a very inviting menu. I've gone for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and unfortunately the only thing I truly enjoy time after time is the brunch lox platter - the presentation is wonderful and the pastrami lox is always delicious. As a native NYer I'm most picky about my bagels which in Chicago are pretty bad - the Gage's bagels fit that bad bill as well but the rest of the platter makes up for it. I've switched it up and had the eggs benedict as well, which is my usual go to brunch meal, but they use British style bacon, not the traditional canadian bacon associated with EB and while I'm always open to inventive spins on classic dishes, this misses the mark. As for dinner, I remain underwhelmed. I cant even recall what I ordered the two times I have been for dinner, but I do recall leaving less than impressed. They do have a phenomenal spicy chicken sandwich which is perfect for lunch.As for the restaurant itself - I like that its never too crowded and seating is generally readily available, both inside and out for nice summer days. The service (in general) is REALLY slow - and for meals like brunch and lunch, its generally key to have an accessible server who is attentive throughout the meal and available with the bill when its time to leave. More often than not, I've sat with an empty plate in front of me for what seems like an eternity waiting to pay and leave.The other quip - and although this might seem trivial is their soda. I'm not a big soda drinker, especially with meals, but my fiance LOVES her diet coke. The Gage seems to only use soda from the bar gun which is consistently FLAT. While they do have a nice, extensive bar, the focus is the restaurant and their beverages should be \"drinkable\". It always seems to taste like what you'd get mixed with Jack Daniels at 3:45 am at a dive bar. Disgusting.I'm giving three stars for their brunch, seating availability, and proximity to where I live.

I live in the area and after coming here a few times with friends during the summer I popped in solo on a cold Sunday to have a drink and warm up. It quickly became a occasional Sunday tradition for me. Nice bartenders, a well made old-fashioned (although, on occasion one of the female bartenders tops off the drink with soda, and totally ruins it), and those AMAZING mussels. Bliss. A few weekends ago after attending the Prop 8 rally downtown I went to the Gage with a friend to have lunch. Our waiter seemed to really not give a crap about our table. We were left alone on many occasions for long stretches. The only time the waiter saw fit to give our table attention was when he addressed me by my last name (which he had gleaned from my credit card), asked if I was married, and then hit on me in front of my friend. It was very uncomfortable and not the kind of thing I expect from a restaurant like The Gage. I admit to being a bit conservative (socially, not politically!) but I thought it was totally out of line. But I've been called a little uptight before so I let it go. This past Saturday while shopping with my mother she suggested we go to The Gage since I'm always raving about it. I didn't think a thing of it until we got the same waiter. The waiter who proceeded to stand a little too close whenever he came over, and then again tried to hit on me by asking if he knew me from somewhere. Through the course of the meal my mother, who knew nothing of my previous experience, noticed that he would be standing near the bar, staring at the table. I could not enjoy my food and ended the meal as soon as possible. I was with my mother for chrissakes! If I rate the Gage solely on my summer and solo experiences I would give it five stars. The mussels are amazing, the fish and chips are absolutely yummy. The brisket sandwich is flavorful and tender. The caramel creme brulee with black pepper biscotti is absolutely AMAZING. I'm still dreaming about it. My friend raved about the peanut butter beignets.

Yes! It's an American version of an Irish (or British, depending on how the light catches it) gastro pub, right down to the monumental bar, deep booths, a fireplace, and sausages on the menu. And it's on Michigan Avenue of all places, across the street from Millennium Park and The Art Institute -- two of the most toured spots in this big-shouldered city. Next.No! But wait! We needed a place to eat after an afternoon at the ballet (pronounce it \"ball-ee\" and get a free appetizer!) and it seemed like it could be delicious (friends who work in the area have raved about its lunch) and not terribly expensive.After being seated in a 32-person banquette (we were but three svelte sirs) and arranging ourselves so we could hear one another from across the table, we gazed at the menu. Since we'd had brunch not too many hours before, Daniel and I split the rabbit salad and a plate of \"locally crafted sausages.\"The salad, I thought, was lovely. The arugula was vibrantly green, as though it had something to prove, and sprinkled with crisp rice -- a textural nuance I very much enjoyed. The rabbit, hiding coquettishly under the bush, was warm, appropriately gamey (Daniel found it a bit too gamey), and plentiful. I was a bit put off by the wedge of cheese, which I only found a few bites away from the end of my portion; it was ostentatious and didn't play nicely with the rest of the ingredients.I don't know if you've noticed, but sausage is all the rage right now. That means that if you're going to do it, you'd better do it right. The Gage, alas, overshot. Two links of a basil-infused sausage were much too fatty -- I could barely pick up my knife again after a few bites, thanks to the onset of Food Coma -- and a ruddy meat blend of a third link was only average. What's more, the beautiful, speckled mound of mustard was a total pacifist in its approach to flavor. Next to the heavy sausages was a charming pot of roasted potatoes -- oh wait, not just potatoes, but also BRIE. Really? It was a prelude to gout on a plate, it was. Dessert made up for some of those missteps -- a rich and complex gingerbread came topped with brown sugar gelato and dried fruits. It's too bad we didn't try the peanut butter beignets, but there will be more ballets in the future, I suppose, and the beer selection would beckon me back after touring with the tourists.

We'd never eaten there before, but it has excellent reviews on Yelp, and a few of my friends highly recommended it. It was soooooo delicious.We were seated in the back next to the kitchen, so we got to witness all of the excitement of the restaurant firsthand. A couple at the table next to us were celebrating a birthday with a tasting menu prepared by Dirk Flanigan, the executive chef.We told our waiter, who was extremely eccentric (in a good way), that it was our anniversary. He promptly brought us out some delicious prosecco (my new favorite)!We started with the amazing scallops, which were served with melted onions, orange segments, crispy chicken skin, and a house-made olive tapenade. The chicken skin added an earthy, savory note to the dish, while the orange segments provided the needed acid and freshness to the dish.Following the scallops, which I am totally craving right at this moment, I ordered the duck leg confit and roasted breast, while Josh ordered the fish and chips (which were flying out of the kitchen left and right).My duck came with roasted endive, wilted grapes and a natural jus. Unbelievable. This was my first time eating a duck, and it won't be the last! The confit leg was just encredible, I don't have words to describe it, but I'll try: earthy, crispy, moist, deep (does that make sense?), tender, succulent.....I loved every bite.The roasted breast was also quite delicious, cooked perfectly (so I'm told), and provided a much-needed contrast to the confit leg. The combination of the grapes, which were sweet, with the endive, which was quite bitter, was awesome. And if you succeeded to get a bit of everything into one bite, it was utter bliss.Mr. Flanigan himself asked me how I was enjoying the duck (quite a bit!) and explained to me the balance of the grapes with the endive. It was great to get such personal service - especially at a restaurant that we'd never been to before. Guess that means we'll definitely be going back!The fish & chips - the ones that kept flying out of the kitchen - were the best I've ever had. The batter was appropriately light and crispy, but you could still taste the Guinness. The chips, which seemed to be twice-fried, could have satisfied me as a meal on their own! And even the tartar sauce was unique and delicious. Super good. I'd definitely recommend you try the fish & chips at The Gage.Then we had an amazing desert, which was a play on french toast and espresso. I don't remember the details, sadly, but I do remember it was delicious, and I would totally get it again. Yum!At long last we were finished, and it was time to go. The Gage picked up our prosecco and desert in honor of our anniversary - how nice! And every employee we passed on the way out took the time to say thanks or goodnight, even though the place was busy.

I had originally picked it because it's a pub and I thought in my head that it would be a fun, casual noisy and cozy/friendly place for a meal. Well, I was a little off. The Gage is trendy and kind of upscale in ambiance. The mood they set in the restaurant is relatively formal. I was surprised to see that it was a relatively family friendly restaurant, since it's a pub. The dining area is separated from the bar area, so it has its onw space and atmosphere. The food was pretty delicious and beautifully presented. They had an amuse bouche with the appetizers we ordered (I love when they do that). We were there for lunch. \u00a0Glad because it's a little pricey for what it is, but the lunch menu is less so. The only other downside -- while we all enjoyed our meals, only one of the four of us said we would order the same thing again. That could be partially due to the fact that they have an incredibly fun menu and you want to try everything because it sounds so good.

It's narrow but deep. I feel like there's a dirty joke to be made in there somewhere, but my coffee just isn't working today, so neither is my brain. It's very nice inside. A pleasant shade of green...sort of an upscale pub with tablecloths and cloth napkins. The servers are all smartly dressed. The people at the host station are OK. Not terribly friendly but not exactly unfriendly either.The food is very good. First I had the Gage burger. At a whopping $16 for burger & fries, it's a bit spendy but it's doggone tasty. The waitress recommended it since she said it was the best burger she'd ever had. I wouldn't go that far (about me that is...it could very well be true for her) but I definitely liked it a lot. One word of warning, however: it's messy to eat. This was OK with me, but if you're there as part of a job interview or something, you might not want burger juice or fixins dribbling down your hands while you eat. You will make use of that nice white (at least to start with) cloth napkin. On my second visit I tried the fire roasted chicken sandwich, which is Gage's version of \u00a0buffalo chicken. I enjoyed that as well. It was flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick. There was perhaps just a bit too much blue cheese. This sandwich is just as messy as the burger. I had fries both times and they were good as well. Not blow-your-mind (or something else) good, but a solid accompaniment to your meal.The service is generally good, though at one point the waitress disappeared for awhile when I needed an ice tea refill. Water glasses were kept full by the attentive bus staff. It does get busy at lunch time, and the place fills up with suits. You'd probably feel a bit under dressed in jeans, but if that doesn't bother you then you're fine. It gets quite loud in here, so it's not a good place for a quiet conversation. The prices are a bit high for lunch, but I don't think they're unjustified.This is a good place for a tasty weekday bite, but the price point (and relative lack of healthfulness of the menu options) makes this an \"occasional treat\" lunch spot rather than a weekly thing.

The Gage is a swanky little refuge from the tourists of Millennium park right on South Michigan Ave. They fancy themselves a gastropub and they certainly deliver on that. Their menu is creative, although it may be a bit overwhelming for the less adventurous types. However, there should be some variation of a stock option to suit your palate. They have tweaked their menu since the last time we were in, sadly the snacks have not changed and still seem bunk to me. I took advantage of the new items and got the BBQ turkey sandwich with caramelized onions and grainy mustard on a tasty pretzel roll like you'd find in Bavaria. Pretty damn good. Other noteworthy items on the list are the Fire Roasted Chicken, Fish and chips and the Gage Burger. Please don't cook that past Medium Rare and enjoy it with some of those great chips. The brunch menu looks good too, but I have not had anything from it yet. They have an impressive selection of beers on tap. Usually a few Germans to be had and about the only place I've seen New Belgium seasonals. Why yes, I'll have another pint. The place reminds me of an old bathhouse, which seems fitting.

Not saying that the Gage is a bad place to be. Quite the contrary. My only real problem I had as I entered was that I was actually an hour early for my reservation, and even though I told the girl at the front of house when I checked in that I was willing to wait, since it was my fault -I hadn't expected the Art Institute to dump us out into the street exactly at 8pm, so I made my res. for 9- she was kind even enough to seat us right away. We were shown a table near the bar and what seemed to be the center of the action, I was almost hoping as we were sat and going over our menus was that if maybe we could of waited and got closer to our actual reservation time that, maybe, we could have been seated near the back where it might have been a little quieter. But what the hell, we were seated, and on a night that was looking rather busy.The menu, unfortuneatly, is a little big and slightly confusing even though it's only made up of one page. The meals were laid out in different courses and you almost got the feeling that you have to order from each course. And with their prices could be very costly indeed, and the drink menu, while smaller in size compared to the entrees, was like reading a phone book of alcohol. Not that's a bad thing, but as soon as we were sat it seemed that our waiter, whose name was Kevin (I had thought he said Brian, while my with thought he told us something completely different, that's how loud it was. But I digress) was table side. My wife and I are usually big wine drinkers, and the Gage has a most impressive list (with prices ranging from $16 to over $400), but we opted for beer instead this evening (a list that was also impressive with everything from the usual domestic and imports to a slew of micro-brews, which we went with. The Chambay to be precise).We ordered appetizers, my wife went with the Scotch Egg (how can you go wrong with a large hard boiled egg coated in ground pork and deep fried in a batter served with course mustard?), I went with the Hot Pouched Shrimp. We shared and I found both plates to be stellar. For our main courses we went with the Fish and Chips (wife) and the 16oz Rib Eye (myself), which I ordered \u00a0medium rare and to my delight was made perfectly. It's sometimes hard to get a steak that's till red and juicy in the center. I was hoping that both entrees would live up to the bar set by the appetizers and they far exceeded my expectations in excellence.Kevin brought over the dessert menu, and while everything on the front looked like it would amazing we decided to try a dessert wine from the other side. We settled on a 10 year old brandy that was so smooth that it was like drinking liquid silk.I found the Gage to an incredible dinning experience and can't wait to go back with friends this time around. Nicely situated across from Millennium Park and a half block away from the Art Institute, so if you're in that area I highly suggest that you stop in for at least an appetizer and a nice bottle of wine.(Side note: make sure you eat as much as you can of your order for the Gage does not have take out bags or doggie bags, and be prepared to spend some money if you are doing dinner.

Arriving at 7:30 on a summer Friday evening, our first impression was how much louder it was inside than out on busy Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park. I mean, REALLY loud. The upscale, but rustic charm of the space barely outshined the acoustical challenges, but we were promptly seated at a big comfy half-circle booth near the back of the house. Our server was witty, attentive and on his game despite the fact that he was obviously waiting several busy tables. Only once did he leave me with an empty glass long enough for another gentleman (headwaiter?) to cut in and offer to refresh my empty pint glass. Nice touch. The bottle list was pretty good, but the selection of drafts was a little sparse for a gastropub. Regardless, I loved all three of my Lagunitas L'il Sumpin' Sumpin' drafts and a taste of a friend's very bright and hoppy Imperial IPA selection.I opted for the mussels in vindaloo broth and the fish and chips, both of which I had heard so many good things about. The mussels were $11 and the fish and chips were $17 so I was definitely expecting good things. The mussels were quite tasty and the vindaloo was a nice touch (and wonderful to sop up with the crusty toast provided). They didn't exactly blow my mind, but my idea of perfect mussels comes accompanied with lots of butter and either a white wine or belgian ale broth. I love Indian flavors so I had no problem finishing them.The fish and chips arrived with three chunky filets served inside a paper cone surrounded by a page of the Irish American News (nice touch!) and over a bed of tasty, if not a bit unremarkable chips/fries. The fish filets were perfectly moist and flaky, almost falling apart in perfect sections on my fork. The batter was a perfect balance of \"enough there to know it, but not so much that the fish was in any way overshadowed\". The tartar sauce was amazing and I could have gone through twice as much of that. The curry served with the chips had a wonderful light flavor, but was too runny and slid off the chips as they were dipped. I was yearning for the thicker onion-laden sauce served at our favorite Irish pubs in town.Others at our table enjoyed the prime burger (both said 'good', but no raves), the scallop dish (very good, but gone in a heartbeat at 3-4 pieces), the pork chop special (high marks from the diner and one of the best-looking chops I've ever seen). One diner also had the bacon-laden brussels sprouts side which I tried a bite of and enjoyed quite a lot.As I said above, service was very attentive. Nice touches like premium glassware, salt and pepper grinders and upscale cutlery gave this a high-end feel in a still very laid back environment.As we were finishing up, the proprietor, Billy Lawless stopped by our table and asked us about our meal. My wife and I had known him back when he was running The Grafton in Lincoln Square so it was nice to see him again.Again, overall a nice evening. The menu has selections that are approachable to most anyone with everything from a burger or fish and chips all the way to more daring selections like bison tartare and saddle of elk. The prices are indeed steep and more in-line with those you'd expect at a more formal \"special occasion\" place, but with the perfect location across from Millennium Park and near hotels and theaters, they'll keep packing them in regardless. Me, I'm going to try them for lunch at the bar next time. I bet that's going to be a little more to my liking.", "Date": "2011-06-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "kris S.", "ReviewID": "1_RAPe6SXP2jcQ66dckjnA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gage's mussels stimulated my Kegel muscles last night.

The Gage has a pretty decent beer list, which is always nice. We were also given a few menus, but we were only interested in what they were offering for Restaurant Week. That menu was surpringly light on options--only 2 choices per course. We both ordered the lobster bisque for the first course. I wasn't a huge fan. It was very bitter. It did have a very prominent lobster flavor and there was a dab of shredded lobster in the bowl, but something wasn't quite right about it. For the entree, I ordered the hanger steak and my friend ordered the white fish. The steak was a surprisingly small portion and again the flavor was lacking. It seemed suprisingly dry for a medium-cooked piece of meat and overall it was very dull. The small splash of sauce and salty greens didn't add much either.

I was intrigued by this combination, and decided to check it out last night for Restaurant Week. Overall I had a great time, really liked the atmosphere and was very satisfied with both my food and drinks. At first I was skeptical because it is across the street from Millennium Park. But when I walked in it was crowded, which I take as a good sign, and I liked the overall vibe. We couldn't get a real table but one opened up by the bar which worked out better anyway. The Gage has a fantastic selection of draft beers - not a huge selection but quality offerings - Green Line, Paulaner, Gossamer, Stella to name a few. The taps were unique. I was happy. You also have to respect a bar that pours beer into the glasses made for the specific beer. When we sat down our waitress was very nice and had a high beer-iq, which was impressive. We decided to pass on the \"restaurant week\" deal, as I did not see anyone else indulging and it was pricey. We had a fondue appetizer, which was mediocre, but then had a \"Gage burger\", which was fantastic. Some reviews on here claim the Gage Burger was an overpriced regular pub burger, but they are very very wrong. You could tell the meat was high quality lean ground beef cooked perfectly, and it was thick. The onions were deliciously caramelized, it was topped with gourmet cheese which blended together nicely. The bread brought everything together, and was not your average hamburger bun. Far from it in toastiness, quality, and taste, however still held the burger together like a true bun should. The fun part were the garnishes that you could place on the burger if you were feeling risky. They included miniature spicy pickles, deliciously rich olives, and the standard lettuce, tomato, and red onion. The pickle that garnished the plate was not timid. It was a full-blown huge dill pickle that provided an awesome crunch to break up the greasy bites of the burger. And then the fries. They were tasty and came in their own separate bowl, as per not to disturb the greatness of the burger plate and mix two different types of greasiness. It's the little things that lead to greatness. The burger got a little sloppy towards the end, but that's probably my fault, not the burgers'. The Gage was relatively expensive. And I say relatively because most other places in Chicago are cheap. I paid prices here that I expected to pay when coming to a major city, based on what I was used to in NYC. $16 for the generous burger with fries, $9 for the fondue appetizer, and $6/beer. Well worth it for the quality service/food/beer you are receiving. Those who don't agree I would venture to call cheap. I'm very torn between 4 and 5 stars. I'll definitely stop back in during the Summer when I'm in the Millennium Park area and make the final decision. Note - as it got later the bar did not fill, it emptied.

Unfortunately for them, it's so I can spread how truly bad I thought it was.Let's dive right in. First course we went for the Fondue after seeing some positive reviews here for it. Let me say that I was, right off the bat, throughly unimpressed. Other than the cheese, the only other thing on the plate is 3 very long pieces of toast. Chef's prerogative here, but this hardly seemed like the delicate accompaniment for the brie and it left us feeling bloated and carb heavy, especially after the complimentary sourdough. As for the fondue itself, just not an impressive dish - flavor profile similar to movie theater popcorn, and that's not a good thing.Moving on to the seasonal option, a chilled corn soup. It comes out looking quite beautiful, a number of toppings on top of a mild yellow broth. Unfortunately, despite the presentation, the entire bowl had a singular bland taste with none of the multiple ingredients adding any flavor. Friend got the lobster and while it actually had taste, it was eh at best. So right around this time, despite being rather unimpressed with the kitchen's showing, we do opt to have another beverage. Unfortunately, this was around the time our waitress went MIA for the next 20 minutes of the meal. To her credit (I guess), when she did reappear, after the plate of soup has been sitting untouched for that long, she bothers to ask if I enjoyed it and when I disclose otherwise, she removes it from the bill.So..things are on the upswing...right? Cue another 15 minute waitress disappearance (with drinks still missing) interrupted by the kitchen sending out a busboy with our meal. This consisted of:Fish and Chips - jeez. just not good. ridiculously greasy and the batter's nothing special at all. Fries were an eyebrow raiser due to an alright seasoning, but not worth the price of admission.Gilt \"Get the Burger\" Burger - alright. average. maybe in a smaller city, this would be the talk of the town, but chicago's got some damn good burgers...no hate, well executed, just not nearly enough to save this place. brioche bun was good, tomatoes were nice and fresh. Tomato and Parmigiano Gratin - tastes like can of tomatoes, an indetectable reggiano and a pathetic garnish of breadcrumbs. This lackluster dish was bothersome itself, but it's particularly annoying because I asked the waitress explicitly when ordering if it was good and she insisted it was great. Either she hasn't tried it or she particularly enjoys canned tomatoes.Soon after our food arrives, MIA Waitress comes back and as she does, I think she overhears me complaining to my companion about her spotty service. She then annoyingly circles the table for a while, which, because we were the only ones in the room at this point, was quite obvious. Then, in a quite impressive feat, manages to not be around when we finish our meal and want the check.Ugh. the location may be good, the drinks might be okay (one more round might have been in the cards were the service better) but the wait staff was not and the food was downright bad, not to mention for the price.", "Date": "2010-08-21", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "K Y.", "ReviewID": "UiALq7G2d9w1S7fvZEv6TA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very expensive for the quality.

The food was excellent, and the waiter's recommendations were spot on. We started with braised Swan Creek goat which was incredibly rich and delicious. It was a perfect winter dish and the flavor sticks with me more than anything else we had that evening. Our second course was the tartare of bison. I am a huge tartare fan, so this is always a pleasure to see on the menu. It was among the best that I have had (although it cannot compare to the antelope tartare at East Side Showroom, in Austin Texas). The capers were a lovely addition to the dish. For out main entr\u00e9es we ordered the Indiana duck leg confit and roasted breast, and the Gunthorp Farm's pork chop. The duck leg was perfect, but the breast was undercooked. The problem with duck is that it is either done right or wrong, there is no middle ground. Everything else about the dish was perfect, especially the celery root puree! The pork chop was among the best pork dishes I have ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly, and the meat quality was far above expectation. I will dream about this pork chop. The service was okay. Our waiter was very personable and knew the menu very well. The only problem is that he was so busy that we did not receive the kind of attention that one expects. We waited a long time before we were able to put in our drink order, waited even longer to order our first course, and could have taken a nap in the time it took to get out main course. It wasn't a huge problem, but it did put us off a bit. The noise level in the restaurant was high, and the tables are extremely tight. We don't mind this too much, but some people will.

I wanted to visit you for a friend's birthday brunch earlier this year, but plans fell through and now I seriously regret the decision. We arrived for Day 2 of (epic) Restaurant Week, and after a disappointing dinner last night I was concerned about how lunch would go. On entering, I was happy to see that there were young couples, older couples, and families all here for brunch and a good time. My boyfriend, the wannabe pediatrician, was delighted to see crayons and paper topped tables for the kiddies to scribble on. Read: do not confuse family friendly with screams and cries interrupting your meal, everyone was extremely well-behaved and it was as if the children were not present. We examined the brunch, lunch, and RW menus, as well as the drinks list. There's definitely a mark-up (we call it the Millenium Park tax), but the food we saw around us looked tasty and reasonably-portioned for price. We still opted for the RW prix fixe \u00a0menu ($22), and started with the celery root puree (soup) with pork confit and braised cabbage. Light, creamy, and very, very subtly tart, I loved the contrast of the sprout tendrils with the soft creaminess of the soup, and the rich, buttery shreds of pork that would pop up every other mouthful. For lunch, we opted for both the duck confit, fried egg, and focaccia sandwich and the whitefish with rye gnocchi. I was in love with first bite. The duck confit (purportedly barbequed) was buried in a flash of spicy, bitter greens, an over easy egg, and a pungent, spicy sauce, and I was impressed with the use of toasted focaccia instead of traditional sesame seed buns. I thought it was a better pairing with the duck, but The Boy disagreed and felt it absorbed too much of the oil from the fillings. The whitefish was EXCELLENT, and I am not amused by what much of Chicago considers well-prepared fish. It calls to mind the Chinese tradition of steaming the fish before finishing it with a hot blaze of scalding oil -- tender, flaky (while avoiding being overdone), with a delicate, seared crisp on both the skin and the surface. It laid on a bed of yummy greens that while sweet, interesting, and new, I felt were slightly too greasy to be overlooked, especially when paired with a light fish. The gnocchi was light and savory, without acheiving the chewy rubberiness that is the bane of all gnocchi consumers' existence. And finally....oh, dessert. We usually skip when we dine out, seeing as it's an extra, unnecessary push towards diabetes and we don't see desserts we're interested in anyways. They hit home with homemade fritters and a dollop of butter pecan-y ice cream. I don't think this is included on the menu available online, but if there is a reason to skip breakfast or do an extra mile on teh treadmill, this dessert may be worth it. Served warm, it's best eaten with a smearing of the ice cream and a dusting of the caramel, toffee bits served on the plate. The anticipation, as Phyllis Lapin Vance would say, is exquisite. When you go (and you MUST go), be sure to try their homemade sodas. The grapefruit soda is tart and sweet, the lime soda more obvious about the simple syrup. Be sure to check out the postings on the wall as you go down to the bathroom, as they pay homage to the Gage buildings formerly housing a millinery and what kind of advertisements were popular at the time. One word of caution: drinks are pricier here than even in the Gold Coast, so I would go elsewhere for these. Service: our server was attentive, cleared the table quickly, and knew that we needed more time to muse over the menus without being annoying. I also appreciate her noticing we had not tasted our plates yet when she came over to check on how we liked them -- too often that is a reflex question in the service industry!Score:+1/1 for service+0.5/0.5 for ambiance+3/3 for food+0.5/0.5 for valueFinal tally: 5 stars.

The interior is classy and I was quite surprised at how far down the restaurant stretched. I also noticed on my way to the bathroom downstairs that they have another private party area with a full bar, a good idea for a birthday or other special events. The bathroom itself looked like is came straight out of a Pottery Barn catalog. The food is your typical full Irish or English pub fare: fish and chips, mussels, burgers and sandwiches with a huge selection of beer. I had fried chicken livers along with mussels and both were excellent. The fried chicken livers had a very crunchy batter that didn't make you feel heavy afterwards and the mussel broth was like nothing I tasted before. In my opinion, the key to a good pot of mussels is the broth and some places make it too salty or too bland. The Gage added an extra kick to its broth with a hint of curry and maybe tarragon. Staff was very attentive as well because we sat in a corner booth tucked away from plain view and our waitress always came out of her way to check in on us.

At first glance, it looks like some kind of Irish pub-in-a-box from the street. But it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to forgo this gem based on that mistaken belief. Where to start? How about the bar? It's long, it's beautiful, it's near huge windows and it's stocked. Really stocked. With beers from around the world and around the corner, seasonal cocktails and everything in between. Even the vodka list is respectable and this would seem more of a whiskey spot. The floors are old fashioned tiles and going there somehow feels grown up- almost elegant in some strange, casual way. Also, it's huge- the front restaurant and bar area opens up into a dining room and there is yet more space downstairs, with a second bar. Anyway, onto the menu, which is divided into four sections- Firsts (starters), Seconds, Thirds and Fourths, the fourths being the largest plates. Quite frankly, anything after the Firsts easily makes a satisfying meal but what is most impressive and commendable is the uniquely delicious preparation AND I love the commitment to organic, natural meats and local ingredients. Favorites include the goast cheese tart with escargot, a scallop lunch salad with a citrus vinaigrette, and my favorite thus far, the carmelized lobster with lemon quinoa and fresh basil. Absolutely stunning!!!! I could go on and on (obviously, I already have). The only change they might consider would be to add a simple green side salad to the menu somewhere. All that richness might be better digested with a little roughage! Cheers, Gage.

When the topic of lunch came up I jumped at the chance to finally eat at this place and bring my craft beer loving friends along with me. It being a gorgeous Chicago day, and that it was around 1pm, the restaurant was quite busy with business people and tourists all looking for a bite. We didn't have a reservation so the wait would be 30 minutes unless we did their patio seating. Because it was so hot out no other patron was sitting outside but we didn't want to wait and decided to brave the heat. Really glad we did that. The seats were in the shade so the temperature wasn't too bad and with a slight breeze it was actually quite comfortable. Because we were the only ones out there our server was kind of awkward at first because he talked to us, took our drink orders, came back with drinks, and then just stood there at our table watching us read the menu. Stood there for a good 5 minutes. Just watching. Kind of weird but I guess he didn't have anything else to do. Their libations list, as they call it, is pretty impressive and I had fun choosing a couple craft beers I've never had before. Got the Darkhorse Raspberry Ale and the Dragon Milk Stout with the stout being the clear favorite. For food I had their House Poutine. Never had poutine before. Knew of it. Have been curious to try it some day. Today was the day. With a nice elk ragout gravy, some cheese, and tasty fries, the whole meal was filling and good. Could of used more cheese but still good. Canada is on to something. My wife had a mushroom sandwich which was decent but I was kind of dissapointed in the overall lack of vegetarian options for her. As our meal progressed our awkward at first server grew on me and turned out to be actually quite warm and helpful. Even though our table started with four people it soon went to five and then to six people as other friends joined us late. Our server, even though by now had other tables to worry about, took this in stride, got us extra chairs, put in the late arrivals' orders, answered drink questions, and was charming doing so. Overall I had a good experince here. Other items on their menu, and the ones I saw at other tables while walking to the restroom, look promising and delicious. I don't know if I will come here regularly but I do know I will certainly return if I have friends visiting.
