Everything from the hip wait staff and funk-eclectic interior decor to the tasty legit DINER experience is beyond my wildest dreams for a vegetarian eatery. I came here w/ a vegan friend who also has multiple allergies, gluten sensitivity, and Crohn's disease. He was absolutely blown away by how food friendly the place was for him--he had his first Reuban sandwich in his entire life, and loved every bite.Personally, I'm not vegan or vegetarian--but I have been around the block with vegetarian dining (in lieu of many vegan/vegetarian friends). And I absolutely loved Chicago Diner. I had the SUV sandwich (\"straight-up VEGGIES\") and it was tasty, clean, well proportioned, and a perfect vegetarian diner entree. It came with waffle fries that were DIVINE--wonderfully seasoned, perfectly crisp.We also got the chips and guac to start. The chips were perfectly crisp, a nice texture, and homemade on site. The guacamole was extremely fresh, zesty, and paired w/ a zesty homemade salsa.All around, no complaints with Chicago Diner. It's rad, fab, and I would totally go there again, even without vegetarian friends.", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Tony G.", "ReviewID": "dN4zHzDTAyl2WtdlNclgqQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This place is our go-to eatery in Chicago.

The location is great, the overall attitude of the place reminds of SoCal, which is a good thing, and I can find your delicious desserts at whole foods :) Unfortunately I see dairy ingredients being added while your menu has shrunken :( I'm glad you're still meat free but it's a bit disappointing to see less item on the menu and yet more animal products being introduced.

None of us had ever been to this location but they couldnt be that different right? We decided to visit here over Chilam Balam, which in retrospect was a huge mistake. All four of the people in our party work in the industry, and three out of four in upscale dining, so we know good service. Ours wasnt. First off, our server continued to handle our water glasses by the rim when picking them up to refill, which is really gross and pretty much the first thing you are taught not to do when learning to serve. When our food came out, our server popped up to make sure everything looked good before we started eating but never verbally quality checked us again. My boyfriend got the risotto and it was really gross. It had no flavor beyond the nutmeg (i think it was) and the rice was really undercooked. He took two bites and pushed it away, obviously not satisfied. Since we all work in f&b it was really uncomfortable and we discussed what to do for a few minutes. While we were talking (and the rest of us were eating) our server walked by several times and looked at the dish, and i could literally see her thought process going. Ive been waiting tables for seven years. I know that look. I watched her decide not to give a crap that he was obviously unsatisfied. She avoided our table in a mostly empty restaurant because she didnt want to deal with him sending his food back. Even if he had worked up the courage to say anything we never had an opportunity to do so. She never actually came up to our table again except to start clearing empty plates and just took his full plate without saying anything. By then it was obviously too late, so we \u00a0just decided to suck it up and not say anything. Our waitress dropped check while half of our party was still eating, which also really, really irritated me and my friends.I understand that we all have our off days but there were so many things about our visit that were just really bad habits that bad food service employees have that I do not think I will be back to this location. I live in the neighborhood but in the future when i crave one of your delicious cajun black bean burgers I'd rather make the trek out to Logan than deal with this again.", "Date": "2014-07-04", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jas D.", "ReviewID": "n3ATv6KbzSFvEAzI0uCGLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yum--those thai chili wingz are spicy heaven!

Yes, that's right, 1983. Before you were born. Before the internet. Before Mel Gibson went batshit crazy. The Chicago Diner been the best vegetarian restaurant in Chicago for over thirty years!I live in Los Angeles now, and people often ask me if I miss Chicago? No, not really I tell them. Friends and family, of course, but what I miss most is being able to eat at the Chicago Diner anytime I want.When I visit Chicago every year, I may be there for 6 or 7 days, and I will eat at the Diner at least four or five times. Either Diner is fine, the original location on Halsted street is my personal favorite because it holds so many dear memories for me, but the Logan Square location is just as wonderful.The food is amazing. I can't tell you how happy eating the Reuben sandwich makes me. Or vegan pancakes, vegan cheesecake, or anything on the menu. It's all so good. So fresh and well prepared. As a vegetarian it is so nice to know that my vegetarian food isn't being cooked on a grill next to a hamburger, or other cross contamination issues in \"mixed\" restaurants. I'm glad there are options out there, but non vegetarian restaurants and their workers don't have the same concerns and care that I expect, and that I always get at the Diner. In short, this place is fantastic! If you are a vegetarian and you have never been here, you have to go soon. If you are a meat eater, you will enjoy the experience so much. No one will try to \"turn\" you. You will just have a great meal.In full disclosure, I have to say that I worked at the Diner in 1983. I started as a dishwasher. I was a cook. I was a server. I was a manager. I spent about seven years of my life working at that amazing location at Roscoe and Halsted. For me it's like going home.

No lie.And the dessert with the caramel toffee crunch was absolutely sinful.So thank you, Chicago Diner, for seducing me in a way that I was not expecting. Your non-assuming exterior/interior and 'vegan' options for this meat-eating gal is all a facade.

I've been here a few times and always like the food, but the prices (and frequently the wait times for a table) are almost always sure to keep me away for the next year or so, sending me to Veggie Bite when I want a vegetarian version of a fast food sandwich. Because this is a vegetarian restaurant, they have real eggs, cheese and other dairy in some of the items, which is awesome. Especially when that cheese is all over fake chorizo nachos. Mmmm....seitanrizo....The sweet potato fries are delicious. I had a spicy cocoa cupcake with cinnamon frosting and a margarita flavored cake with lime frosting - both were delicious and would happify anyone, but I dislike that the cakes were served cold instead of being brought to room temperature first, cause cold frosting sucks. Portions of what I got were tiny, but I saw some massive platters of food going to other people, so I'd have to say that portions are somewhat inconsistent. But veggie or not veggie, diner food is meant to be served in ginormous sizes meant for glutenous overindulgence. But the prices, oy! My veg inclined friends are always telling me how much money I could save by not eating meat - they must not eat here all the time. Vegetarian food - especially sandwiches - should not cost more than meat versions, unless truffles are involved. Good truffles, too. Or maybe unless vegetables from other parts of the world that had to be imported are involved. Maybe. 10 chips, a dollop of salsa and a little glop of guacamole? Like $9 with one refill of chips. They have a children's menu (yea!) but charged me $4 for an tiny apple juice for a 2-year-old (boooo!). Veggie enchiladas for $11? I could see the $5 for the (yummy) sweet potato fries, if only the portion was not like as if it was a part of the kids' menu - you should never be able to count the fries on your plate. I want that number un-fricking-countable. The bill for four people was almost $100 - and two of us only shared veggie nachos, fries and cake... That is not what I'm talking about for diner food - that's my freaking grocery bill. I guess I want more than diner ambiance for those kind of prices.

I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble, so I won't say when or who our server was, but I do hope the server sees this post and reflects on his service. We came in when there were maybe 5 other tables. We ordered Wingz and Potstickers, then 2 orders of the mushroom lentil loaf. We got our Wingz pretty quickly, mango habanero, delicious! We thought it odd that our potstickers hadn't come with it, but thought maybe they just brought the food as it was ready. Finished our Wingz and waited. Sat looking around for awhile until my boyfriend got up and asked our waiter about the potstickers. He said he forgot to put them in and he'd do that now. No problem, things happen. As we're sitting and waiting our server comes over and puts 2 dishes in front of us that we didn't order, when we told him he laughed and brought them to the table next to us. Still no big deal, probably just one of those days. We finally get our potstickers, delicious! And our correct dishes, delicious as always! If you haven't tried the mushroom lentil loaf, you really should! That chipotle brown sugar ketchup is to die for! When we're done, the server brings up the bill and I'm a bit surprised to see he didn't at least knock a few bucks off of the $7 potstickers that we waited for and he admitted forgetting. As a server/bartender myself, I know any time I've made a mistake I do something to apologize to the customer. My boyfriend is also a bartender, so of course we would never tip less than 20%. We paid with cash, leaving more than 20% in the book and as we're closing the book and getting our stuff together, our sever drops another check to us. We're thinking, ok maybe it's a discounted check because he forgot? Nope. Same check, same total. He clearly forgot he had just dropped the check less than 5 minutes before. Clearly an off day.

A sandwich with a side of steamed kale can set you back $12.00 and the fact that it tastes like every wrong stereotype of meat substitutes and cardboard is wrong - just plain wrong. Maybe my standards for vegan/vegetarian fare was set too high by places that use salt and creative menu choices. Maybe it's the fact that the menu resembles the Morning Star line of products in the freezer a little too closely to justify paying premium for it. Maybe my expectations for seitan to be used beyond the recipe on the side of the package from Whole Foods is expecting too much.

They are really good at what they do, but that being said, I can understand why non-vegans/non-vegetarians might not be too impressed. Their fake cheese/fake dairy aren't that great...but I'm generally a vegetarian and haven't really tried much fake cheese/fake dairy, so I don't have much of a basis for comparison. The place gets very busy and they don't take reservations. They also charge a 20% gratuity if you want to split the bill 3 or more ways and they ask that you tell them that upfront. We had a 35 min wait. In the winter, they have a big yellow tented heated patio area in the back for you to wait in. It's pretty warm and they have vanilla rooibos tea for free while waiting. 1. Peppermint hot chocolate was very nice on a cold day. Peppermint flavor was great, and I couldn't even tell that it was vegan--the whipped cream on top was pretty convincing.2. Thai wingz were my favorite. Really good texture, very crispy, great sauce with good lime flavor, and also great dipping sauce. Everyone should order this.3. The poutine was OK. The waffle fries they use are pretty standard waffle fries...nothing special or exciting. The vegan gravy and the vegan cheese were underwhelming; they didn't have much flavor (honestly could have just used some salt) and the texture was a little powdery and runny....but again, I've never had vegan cheese before, so I don't have much else to compare it to. Also, came out a little cold--but they were very busy.4. The quinoa chili was disappointing. The hush puppy it came with was cold, there was no spicy flavor, it was too tomato-y and sour, the peppers were flavorless and overcooked, and there should have been more beans. It could have come out of a can. Needed more garlic/chili/onion flavor.5. The mac and teese was also disappointing. The noodles were nothing special and probably a little over-boiled. The 'teese' tasted very bland...but again, I've never had vegan cheese before, so I don't have much else to compare it to. This is really an opportunity for improvement: they could bake the macaroni, they could saute it with some mushrooms or onions or garlic, etc.6. The titanic burger was good. And huge. The french fried onions that came on the burger were a little soggy and didn't have much onion flavor, but the sauce of the burger was good. The fake bacon was unconvincing and honestly, very sad looking...but bacon is really hard to imitate. The tomato slice on the burger didn't have good texture...but since tomatoes are NEVER in season, I don't blame them. The sweet potato fries were good, but didn't have as much sweet potato flavor as I would have liked.7. The mushroom lentil loaf was OK. Came with WAY TOO MUCH ketchup on top. The loaf itself had a very powerful (and kind of strange) sweetness to it--maybe cinnamon? The stuffing it came with was OK-- the sauce it came with was bland and the stuffing itself was a little soggy and tasted too much of rosemary or something. The cinnamon apples on the side were really great, though. 9. The pierogi quesadilla was good. The mushrooms and onions needed more flavor and the sauerkraut was a little too stringy--but it was still good, overall. 10. Hard cider was good--but very standard/nothing special.Service was really good--everyone was attentive and good-humored.

Maybe I had my hopes up too high for this one. \u00a0Maybe I didn't order the \"right\" thing. \u00a0Maybe the bar has been set ridiculously high by Real Food Daily in L.A. \u00a0Or maybe (I hate to think) The Chicago Diner really is just A-OK (and not mindblowing-ly amazing like I thought in my head).I appreciate places like TCD for providing vegetarian and vegan comfort foods to the veg-head and flexible meat-eating masses. \u00a0While mostly simple in design, sometimes a veggie just doesn't feel like cooking. \u00a0Or you want to introduce a friend or family member to something different. \u00a0Or you're looking for your own ideas to try at home. \u00a0I get it. \u00a0But what I don't get is faux-meat and faux-cheese parading around in an attempts to be end-all vegetarian cuisine. \u00a0Honestly, it's just meatless.Like I said, maybe I didn't order the right thing, my stomach deciding for me with the BBQ \"Bacon\" Cheeseburger with mac-n-\"cheese\" for a side. \u00a0And deep-fried seitan chunks tossed in Frank's for an appetizer. \u00a0And truly, my friend's flash-garlic greens (whatever that means) were the best part of either of our meals (in my opinion). \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because it was the vegetable. \u00a0I face this same hang-up with Denver's sole meatless monopoly (Watercourse Foods and City O' City [same company/owners])--that it's mostly salty, fatty stuff that just happens to have no meat. \u00a0And terrible vegan cheese.Perhaps my long-running lacto-ovo status has turned me that far off vegan cheese (because I really only dig cashew ricotta), but the mac-n-cheese was just a little to \"off\" and plastic-y for me. \u00a0The burger was quite good; not going to lie it was exciting to be able to order a \"bacon cheeseburger\" without having to \"sub a veggie patty and no bacon\" (because usually at restaurants the bacon cheeseburger comes with some other toppings that I enjoy). \u00a0We also ordered a chocolate-chile cupcake for dessert that was divine (vegan baking always having a dear spot in my heart). \u00a0But overall TCD just lacked the \"wow\" factor I was hoping for. \u00a0And that bums me out.I will add: I am glad to have tried it. \u00a0If I visit Chicago again I might try again and go for a more vegetable-centric dish. \u00a0I also realize I'm breaking the mold with this review (just like with my stance on Denver's Watercourse) because TCD's less-than-4-star reviews are few and far between. \u00a0But I will review and post with integrity and honesty. \u00a0And that honesty stands at three stars. \u00a0And three stars only. \u00a0Lastly, if I were rating just the walnut brownie that I purchased to take back to the Mile High with me, then that would surely receive four stars. \u00a0So maybe... come for the baked goods and stay for the meatless mains?", "Date": "2012-05-03", "Author_Location": "Denver, CO"}, {"Author": "Molly O.", "ReviewID": "2FffLo4B5NO4XO0Bk7WoDg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was trying to figure this one out...is it a three or is it a four? Vegan friend in town meant lets go try The Chicago Diner! Wednesday night at 8pm, I got there before the two other folks in my party, and they seated me right away...to sit there...to not be offered a drink...for 10 minutes. Look over here!! Yes, me, the back booth, I want a drinky! Maybe they oversaw my text to my friends that said \"I am in the back booth. It smells like hay in here.\" After the rest of my party showed up, we waited quite a bit longer...finally got our orders taken from a super friendly server, and once we initially were waited on, the service was attentive and great from that point. Just had to get the ball rolling I guess. They were out of one of their specials - what I wanted- because they were changing over the menu. Okay, so I went with the black bean burger with a side of miso soup. Vegan friend got the pulled \"pork\" on a pretzel roll with mashed potatoes. Non-hungry partner got sweet potato fries and a side of mac n cheese. We also ordered chips/salsa/guac for an app. It was kind of ridiculously expensive for the chips, but the guac was pretty damned good. My burger came piled high with sprouts and ripe tomatoes, along with a chipotle-mayo dressing that was sooo good. I think it was Veganaise. I love Veganaise. There is always some in my fridge. I could eat it by the spoonfull, but instead put in on carrots so I don't feel as bad about myself:) Soup was blah. My boyfriends vegan mac n cheese was surprisingly good, given that the cheeze dipping sauce for the fries was not that tasty. Vegan friend enjoyed his pulled \"pork\" sufficiently. The Chicago diner had some pretty great beer specials, and my wine pour was generous. I was veg for 5 years back in the day so I really do appreciate this place, but don't really see myself returning unless I am with a pretty strict vegan.

It was very delicious but tad bit dry. The burger came with two different kinds of sauces that were both amazing, I couldn't even tell you what they were, just spicy and tangy. I liked the decor and atmosphere of the place. I also got a soy chai latte to-go. The chai tasted very fresh and not at all like those from syrups versions.

At most places they are greasy, over fried, brown and sad. At Chicago Diner their sweet potato fries ACTUALLY TASTE LIKE SWEET POTATO! Imagine that!!! My boyfriend had their Dagwood Sandwich and loved it, also got the amazing sweet potato fries.Our second visit I ordered the Sweet Potato Quesadilla with gauc. It was very good but the sweet potato on it was a little too sweet, I could have used some onion on it for texture and to contrast the sweet. Still delicious though, their gauc is also great. Boyfriend ordered their Karma Burger, said it was great too. We both decided we liked our first meal better, Gyro and Dagwood Sandwich. First time going was for a birthday party and we sampled our friend's Vegan Cheesecake, it was somehow amazing. I do not know how you make cheesecake without diary taste good but Chicago Diner does it. I love this place, it is well priced, fresh, healthy and natural.

Granted, they are health conscious meat eaters, one a former vegetarian, but their overall approval is telling. Chicago Diner isn't \"weird\".I was highly impressed with the variety of the menu. There are lots of fresh vegetables on hand, as well as meat substitutes, used to create ethnic or American traditional dishes. Sandwiches come with the side order of your choice (12 choices!). Some will cost you a dollar extra, but judging from my dollar side salad, it is worth it. Fresh sprouts galore. Things like vegan potato salad, macaroni and cheeze, sweet potato fries, are no extra cost with your sandwich. This is a great place to visit if one is craving junk food but doesn't want to feel like crap after eating it.I ordered the blackened tofish sandwich (with advocanaisse?) with side salad. My two companions ordered a gyro with Spanish rice and the roasted vegetable lasagna. I must admit, my tofish sandwich was weird. It looked like a blackened, perfectly rectangular slab of tofu, but tasted like Cajun blackened fish (did not have the texture). How did they make the tofu taste like fish? I have no idea, but I would order it again. The multi-grain bun that makes up the sandwich is delicious and very filling.We were all excited to try each others' food. The gyro was great, except a little too salty. The vegan tzatziki sauce will knock your socks off...its different from dairy, but in many ways better. The gyro-eater wanted me to try the Spanish rice \"for my review\". He thought it was \"okay\". I thought it was great since he had already poured a bunch of tzatziki sauce on it. The roasted vegetable lasagna was fresh tasting, and the companion was impressed that it filled him up.I know they have beer and wine, I'm not sure about full bar so check on that. When a waitstaff messed up the drink order they appropriately offered to fix it but the companion decided to have the \"surprise\" drink. It's a pleasant place.

The Chicago Diner takes the misconception that vegetarian/vegan food is \"bland & boring\" to rest. Their food is very flavorful & hearty. Definitely yummy veggie comfort food. The Diner has such a vast menu, which is soooo refreshing for me as a vegan, since at most restaurants, I'm lucky if I can find a handful (if even) of food options to eat. If anything, at the Chicago Diner, It's actually hard to select something to eat here - but - that's not a complaint! More like, can I get one of everything please? ;) And, even meat eaters will not feel left out. I've dined here many times with some of my militant carnivore friends, and even they have wound up loving the food from here - including foods they may not have tried otherwise. I've been going to this restaurant since the late 80's - early 90's & have remained a devoted fan of this place ever since. I cannot express enough what a pleasure it is as a vegan to have so many great choices to choose from on their menu.Although I usually order the same thing every time - my favorite being the \"Tofu Scramble Jubilee\". I have actually overheard strangers on the street talking about how much they love that dish - and I chimed in to agree. It's *that* good. Although since I initially drafted this review - I heard they took that off the menu (* insert Ferris Bueller-esque \"Nooooooooo\"... echo* \u00a0;) \u00a0But other favorites dishes there of mine are their vegan nachos (and the portions are large enough to share with a friend) veggie chili, various soups... And for desserts - their vegan Chocolate Raspberry cake & Blueberry Muffins are to die for! Dang, I'm getting hungry just writing about it. Also, they have great drinks. In particular, I love their blueberry margaritas, which are sweet, very fresh & refreshing. But - they are quite strong. They don't skimp out on the alcohol - so that is always a plus as you're getting your money's worth (unlike most tradional bars) But - as a heads up - these margaritas are very potent (well - from what I recall anyway, after stumbling out of there a couple times. lol :) The actual diner itself is on the small size and tends to be rather busy, especially on the weekends, where it gets even more loud & cramped. I prefer to be seated in the booths - as it is more intimate/private - yet with more room - unlike the tables in the middle where you can wind up dining with complete strangers - or get bumped into all the time. So - I wait til a booth opens up. Or - sit in the back in their patio section - which is nice when the weather permits. The main con however is the service in general. The wait staff tends to be inattentive. I have felt ignored waiting to be seated and the food can take awhile too. Sometimes even just to get a glass of water before you order your food. However, it's not like that all the time, and the past couple times I've been there, the service was better & friendlier. Overall, the food is definitely worth it - delicious, filling, healthy comfort food. And, there is something for *everyone* there to eat... for vegans, vegetarians & carnivores alike - we can *all* get along at the Chicago Diner ;)Pros: Great tasting food, Healthy dishes, Huge diverse menu Cons: Poor service, Long waits , Loud and cramped place", "Date": "2012-07-03", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Dani C.", "ReviewID": "yoPseRp7D5WXEFA4Tx4fTA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Excellent for vegans!

I ate at the Diner many, many times, but with the greater variety of choices in the last several years, my food dollar went elsewhere.Monday's dinner at The Chicago Diner showed that little has changed over the intervening years. Oh sure, they serve alcohol now, and there is no bulletin board or pile of leftie printed publications in the entry, but the place looks just the same.We arrived at 6pm, when the place was only about half full. By the time we left around 7:30pm, there were people waiting on the sidewalk to get in. This is still a small restaurant. I believe there is an outdoor seating area, but that doesn't appeal much in December.I ordered a Portugese red wine and my friend had a pinot noir. Both were vegan and chemical free, each glass cost $7.00, and each was delicious. There was one other red wine we could have tried, a couple of whites, several beers, and a few mixed drinks. If we had gone through that list, I would be in no shape to write this review today.My friend ordered the Bi Bam Bop entree, featuring a lot of Asian-style vegetables and seitan. I tried the Chipotle firehouse wrap, and added a small cup of guacamole for $2.00. We both really enjoyed our entrees. Hardly one speck of food was left. These were filling enough that we did not want dessert. Service was professional and friendly.

Just north of the diner building, there are diagonal spaces where you can park after 6:00pm weekdays. I don't remember what the rules for the weekend are.

Amazing!!!.After a ten minute wait, we were seated, after which it took our server TWENTY minutes to finally come over and ask us for our orders. We ordered the Fiesta Calzones for appetizers, I got the Chiken Parmesan Sandwich with the French Onion Soup and he got some Asian inspired noodles something. FORTY minutes later (no exaggeration), during which we seriously contemplated just getting up and leaving because our waiter did not approach us ONCE for anything- forget telling us something was wrong or that the food was coming, or even to refill our water - our main course comes out. When we ask the waiter what happened to the calzones, he shrugs, and smiles like he couldn't give a damn. I - very politely- ask him if he would go check on it and he flounces off to go figure it out.We contemplate whether to start eating, and finally, because we're so hungry by this time, we do, and the French Onion soup is awful- it tasted like the broth itself was \"off\".

She is getting off work after 6:00 pm and we should go somewhere for dinner. So we all agree on the Chicago Diner. It's a cute little place, looks very clean and everyone that works in Chicago Diner is extremely friendly! We start out our meal with a few appetizers. We ordered the Hummus, the Potstickers and the Taquitos. The Hummus was excellent, I just love Hummus. It was almost as good as the Hummus I had at Semiramis (read an earlier review of mine), which is probably the best Hummus around. The Potstickers, our daughter recommended, she has been here before. She just loved the flavor and taste of the Potstickers. I would have to agree with her, they were very flavorful and tasty. We all thought they were very good. I was the only one who tried the Taquitos and I thought they were very good too. I thought nice and crispy and tasty. The dipping sauces added a little extra punch and flavor to the Taquitos too. For our main courses our daughter ordered the Caesar Wrap, Maria ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. We all sampled each others dishes. We all agreed my Philly Cheese Steak was the best. The faux steak was good, you could not tell it wasn't real meat. Our daughter's Caesar Wrap was good. Again I could not tell that it was a vegetarian dish. We all thought Maria's Mushroom Ravioli dish was just ok. It was the only true average dish of the whole meal. We all ordered drinks too. I ordered a Banana and Blueberry smoothie, I love smoothies. It was very good! It was a dark blue color, from the blueberries and a strong banana flavor. Maria and our daughter both order tea for their drinks. So overall we highly recommend Chicago Diner. Our total bill came to roughly $65 dollars for drinks, three appetizers and three main courses. A lot of food we thought for the price. It is a tough call though because Maria thought for a vegetarian place this was five stars but only four stars for an overall restaurant. Our daughter truly loves this place. I thought this was a four and a half star place, sooo close to five stars though.

When one says the word \"vegan\", the first thing that comes to my mind is \"nope\", so, of course, I was initially skeptical of this Boystown establishment.I could not have been more wrong to doubt in the Chicago Diner.The diner serves various dishes that are found in the stereotypical American diner like salisbury steak, chili, burgers, etc. as it should (it's a diner, what else would it serve?), except with a vegetarian/vegan twist. There's not a slice of meat or animal product to be found anywhere in the diner, and while that may sound terrible to diehard carnivores like me (on most days), it actually isn't the case at all.When I came here with my friends, I had the Salisbury Staek (deliberately misspelled because it isn't actually steak!), which consisted of a nicely sized \"staek\" made of seitan, which is probably the most convincing meat analogue I have ever had, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and potatoes. The dish blew my mind. Had I not known beforehand that the staek was not actually made of meat, I would not have been able to notice the infinitesimally small tinge of gluten aftertaste. Everything on the plate was alive and well with flavor, which I totally did not expect from a vegetarian restaurant. We also ordered the special recipe wingz, which were also made of seitan, and tasted exactly like a batch of delicious buffalo wings from Claim Jumpers, albeit shaped in odd triangular prisms. What really revolutionized my opinions of vegetarian food, however, was the Choc Chip Cookie Dough milkshake, which I still insist could not have been vegan. How can anyone make such an amazing milkshake without any cow milk?Aside from the food, my group found the servers to be relatively amicable and helpful. I have no personal complaints about the ambiance. In fact, I found it to follow the stylistic precedent established by the food of attempting to imitate an ordinary diner, whilst adding an interesting twist with the dim lighting and music.My only complaint for the diner would be the fact that the patio at the back of the restaurant emanates a tinge of the smell of old gym socks and rubber, which is certainly not the most palatable smell, but honestly, it's not that bad.So if you're up for a culinary adventure or simply want to respect your dietary restrictions while simultaneously indulging in some incredible vegetarian food, then do yourself a favor and visit the Chicago Diner (and explore Boystown while you're at it)", "Date": "2013-01-31", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mork M.", "ReviewID": "8JrTTbc81eG6cQ8SwwYYkQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Expensive and the food is hit or miss as of late.

It is not a diner if there are no fries and sweet potato fries absolutely do not count. 2. Avocado tostada- this just wasn't a good idea. I mean, there were flavors... did they intrigue my palate? did they meld? Not really. Are there more delicious veggie/vegan friendly things you can put on a tostada besides quinoa? Absolutely. It didn't add anything to the dish besides grainy texture. And! Tostadas are already messy, try eating on with tiny grains piled on em! Plus, the tortilla was meh.3. Nachos- were tasty, but my (dairy) cheese was burned in the middle...conveniently the burned spot was localized under the guac and sour cream so I didn't realize it until I was half way through the plate. 4.

Chunks of seitan a just barely similar texture to chicken, drizzled with a very flavorful wing sauce, coming with standard sides of dressing and celery sticks.I then had the vegan gyros, which so closely resembled real gyros in appearance, texture, and flavor. Very well done! You definitely get that sort of nuttiness that you always get from fakemeats, but it's easy to ignore with the rest of the gyro flavor present. It's topped with the standard onion and tomato and comes with a very delicious tzatziki sauce.

My friends and I went here on a busy Saturday night in mid-summer. I was expecting a wait, but it really wasnt that long. We waited for 15 mins for outdoor seating and they even came to get us when our table was ready. The outdoor seating, hidden by the kitchen, is absolutely charming. It was beautiful and quiet and had such lovely lighting. We all really enjoyed the outside experience. Our waiter was patient with all of my omni friends who were quiet overwhelmed and I so excited I didnt know what to get. We ended up getting a seasonal appetizer, which I believe was artichoke dip with pita chips. It was really delicious, but the portion was barely enough for a bite each for the 4 of us. More so, the price didn't fit the portion. Now we ordered the Reuben, the Chikn Ranch, and Portabella Caesar Wrap. The Reuben and the Chikn Ranch was by far all of our favorites. We ate every bite, even when our stomach were saying no. The Portabella wrap was a little bland and completely fell apart. Their reuben is absolutely amazing. I never liked Reuben's when I was an omni, but this one was amazing. They make their own sauerkraut, which was a bit crispy making it taste so nice and fresh. And the seitan! Even my omni friends could not believe that it was vegan. The Chikn Ranch sandwich was also so good. We all decided to get cake. Deciding on Cookies n' Cream and Lemon Raspberry. But as a vegan who dies to bake...eh, it doesnt live up to the price tag or the description. Cookies n' Cream was dry and not as flavorful as it could have been. Lemon Raspberry was quite delicious, but again the flavors were a bit dull and the cake still somewhat dry. If you do decide to get desert, I would get their cheesecake, milkshake, or if you really want cake, to get one that is more fruit centered as they appear to be more moist. I went back a few months later and got a Reuben with the mac and cheese. The Reuben was great, aside from the bread having soaked a bit of the juices from the plate, so it wasn't as crisp and toasty as I would have liked. But the mac and cheese. Any vegan who missed GOOD and almost real mac and cheese...order a plateful. I was so taken aback. I had to ask my waiter to make sure that it was the vegan version as it tasted so real. Didn't have any nooch aftertaste that most homemade recipes have. Seriously brilliant.My table then all decided to split a huge peanut butter chocolate milk shake.

However, I was slightly disappointed of the gyoza (dumplings), which was overcooked, and the black bean soup, which would qualify as a stew rather than soup. Although I applauded Chicago Diner's effort of making vegetarian food friendly to non-vegetarians, I thought the food lost the point of being a vegetarian - eating healthy. The fact that most food here are deep fried makes it healthier to eat steak than satin. I may bring my non-vegetarian friends here to change their perception that vegetarian food is plain and boring.

It's a very strange phenomenon. They have a very extensive menu, and perhaps I talk myself into believing that I will order something that is anything better than \"meh!\". I usually leave asking why I went again.First off, I should mention the Chicago Diner is going to move directly across the street soon. Hopefully this will solve some of the seating problems. The restaurant is pretty small and at peak times, the wait can be long for a table. When the weather is nice, the outdoor seating helps out a lot, but if you go during the cold weather season, be prepared to wait out on Halsted. My problem with the Diner is this, it's supposed to be the incredibly well known vegetarian restaurant. Visitors know of it and flock to it, but it just isn't that good! Many of the faux meat items I have had tried are either rubbery (most recently, the chicken style seitan in the stir fry) or overly greasy (chicken parmesan sandwich). I just think that the reputation this place has, coupled with it's long history should lead to much tastier food. They do a few things well, the vegan mac and cheese is pretty tasty, but overall I find this place inconsistent. The only thing that I have \u00a0ever ordered more than once is the biscuits and gravy, which are good... but can't touch the Handlebar's.One good thing about the Chicago Diner (and the thing that got them three stars instead of two) is that the desserts are excellent. They have great vegan cakes and cheesecakes. They also have great vegan milkshakes, they aren't cheap (6 bucks!) but, they are pretty damn good. If you have to go, get a coffee and dessert, that way you won't be disappointed.I almost feel bad, as a long time vegan, giving this place a less than glowing review. I am glad it's there, but I just wish they would work to make it better.

We shared the hot \"wings\" They were in stick form, which was hilarious as no chicken would ever come in a stick (though I did have a star shaped chicken nugget at Hardees once growing up) They had a good amount of spice and a little weird texture but were good. I had the Jerk Chickin with red potato salad which was good (the portions are huge!) but I would have liked more fixings in my wrap. (And less wrap, let's focus on the yummy inside part!) There was just a little tomato and too much onion, I would have liked more with the chicken.

I narrowed it down to two options - the entree Country Fried \"Steak\" or the Dagwood Sandwich.I went with what the waiter suggested, the Dagwood Sandwich - it was a veggie meat smorgasbord (would \"orgy\" have been appropriate?) of seitan, beef and bacon. I also ordered a side of vegan mac and cheese to round out the experience. The sandwich was delicious, and I loved pigging out on the guilt-free meats. The only wish I had was that they used regular lettuce over the shredded lettuce that came on it. Although not as creamy and excessive as it's dairy counterpart, the mac and cheese was a good accompaniment.For dinner a few days later, I came on a Friday night at prime time hours. As expected, it was packed and there were a few parties waiting, but I was seated within fifteen minutes at a table. I immediately knew what I wanted: the Country Fried \"Steak\". I can never pass up anything out of seitan, especially when its fried. As I cut a slice of seitan dripping with gravy and put it in my mouth, I knew I hit jackpot. This was diner food vegetarian style and it was good.It came with mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables - the potatoes were good and the vegetables were okay.To finish the meal off I had the yummy Chocolate Chip vegan cheesecake. Was it required? No. But did I care? No. It was yummy and a nice way to end the meal.I wandered off to the red line to head back to the hotel, in my proper winter coat I had bought a few days earlier to shield me from the cold Chicago nights, with the thought of this restaurant on my mind...", "Date": "2010-01-27", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Natalie F.", "ReviewID": "yasH2uag0OkuhvvcGT1dmg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Look I love meat......seriously........but this places does have fantastic food and when my friends are in from out of town that are vegans I have no reservations about bringing them here for the food.I have to say though the best part of this gem?

Okay, they do serve a lot of omnivorous imitation stuff, but sometimes that's what I want. I wanted to see why they were so well recommended and compare their imitation to what I know. I recommend this place to everyone, but especially to new vegans as you make the transition from animal based to plant. I also find that omnivores actually prefer more of the veggie vegan foods to the imitation meat vegan foods. If you are an omnivore and are going to order imitation meat stuff, go in with the mindset of trying something new, otherwise you may end up a bit disappointed. Some imitations are great, others are yucky. I totally understand as I'm not into everyday imitation food (but it makes a good treat sometimes). :-)Understand that you could be waiting outside a while. When we arrived we were told to wait 20-25 minutes. When we were entering, newly arrived people were being told 40-45. They have a few benches in front and a patio in back (I didn't check out the patio). When you arrive, go in and stop just inside the restaurant. Someone will take your name, the size of your party, and how long a wait you will have.I ordered the reuben with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy along with a strawberry banana shake. My husband ordered the country \"steak\" which came with pesto veggies and mashed potatoes with gravy. He also ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough shake. Break down:*Reuben: I have got to remember to order my food free of cheese. Vegan cheese, at least to me, has a very powerful flavor which can (and did) dominate the flavor. I couldn't taste the thousand island dressing. I ordered the sauerkraut on the side because I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was pretty bland. Sloppy sandwich, but I still enjoyed it. My husband really liked the bit he tried.*Mashed potatoes with gravy: I almost divorced my husband and was ready to marry any employee there who could replicate them. So. Flipping. Yummy. My husband also loved his. Highly recommended.*Strawberry banana shake: Amazing! It doesn't say strawberry banana shake on the menu, but when I saw strawberry I asked if they could make strawberry banana and she said yes. Even my husband, who usually thinks banana overpowers most foods, thought it had the right strawberry/ banana balance of flavors. Highly recommended.*Country \"steak\": It is made with seitan. My husband loved it, and I loved the piece I tried. Reminded me of mock chicken leg only better then the kind they give you in school for lunch. Highly recommended.*Pesto veggies: meh, plain even with the pesto.*Chocolate chip cookie dough shake: My husband almost divorced me and was ready to marry any employee there who could replicate it. His eyes absolutely lit up when he tried it, he said it was the best chocolate chip cookie dough shake he's ever had. I tried a bit and loved it.

After several failed attempts to get here while in the city a few times ,i figured i should make a special trip to get there.It's not like me to make a 40 mile run for food, but i figured this place was special.All of the reviews spoke kindly of this place..(most anyway). Well i finally arrived here today after taking the Metra from the suburbs and then i took the C.T.A. #151(Chicago's city buses),and i was on that about an hour and a half due to all of the traffic rerouting from the Air and Water Show at the beach. I got off on Halsted and something, i cant remember and walked down the street which was about 3 blocks.On the way there i saw a number of gay looking people and an actual couple that were gay.Two men holding hands..It finally dawned on me that the rainbow flags that i had been looking at posted everywhere meant that i was in a gay and Lesbian area of Chicago that i hadn't known anything about. After acknowledging this i felt better because i knew i would be in a tolerable area where discrimination wouldn't be something that would be celebrated but rather frowned upon. I walked up to the restaurant and my first impression from around the place was that it probably was going to be filled with a bunch of gay guys and extra crowded(gay guys were outside hanging out).I got in and found out i was wrong from the start.They had every seat filled and it was men and women in there. I was thinking that i was going to have to get my order to go when the hostess told me their was seating in the back patio area. I said cool and decided to stay.The back patio area is accessible by going through a portion of the kitchen ,and i felt weird going through it since it didn't look that nice..not so much dirty, just old,small and crowded with a few people in it .It would make you think why would they even bring people this way?,this isn't what you want to see before you sit down and eat! I sat down and I had two wait staff people.I noticed that it was only arm room only up in there.I was given a glass of water that had cucumber slices in it.This changed the taste of the water dramatically, but no so much for the worst ,just not as delicious as maybe filtered water with a twist of lemon or lime in it. I decided to order the sandwich combo because i figured that would be easy for me.I got the Gyro with a side of sweet potato fries.Ill just say that they tried their best..I don't think a non-vegetarian would be pleased completly.Since I'm a vegetarian I'll give it 4 stars.This meal would have been given a2 or a 3 by someone that maybe was expecting the comparison to be a little bit closer in taste to a real Gyro.The pita fries weren't the best, but they has a sweet taste and i think they were homemade. I got a second entree to take home with me and i purchased the Reuben sandwich with a side order of mac and cheese.My personal opinions have to be hidden since i think i might not like Reuben sandwiches to begin with.I don't want to hinder anyone from the experience of a great tasting sandwich. I had them add Daiya cheese and the other stuff that comes with it didn't appeal to my tastebuds..This is not to say that i wont finish my sandwich.I'm just saying i wouldn't be ordering this again.The mac and cheese in the \"to go\" tray was just a dollop and not really that much.I was upset since vegan Mac and cheese is tasty..I enjoyed the little of it that i could. That's all for now but i want everyone to know that to me this place is a 4 star but for others i could fairly say that today's entrees would have to be a 3.. But it's really funny the loyalty us Vegetarians have to our restaurants.Even though i wasn't the happiest with todays selection, i refuse to give this place a bad review..I see potential, and i wont give a bad review to an establishment that puts together a good presentation at least. I know i can be weird like that with my reviews.Maybe I'm just an ass-kisser in denial, or a crowd follower that doesn't want to give this place a bad review..Ill let you know next year when i come here again and try a third entree...They do say three times a charm.I wont drop any stars until i know about the third meal..if it's good then ill boost them up a star, if their bad then ill drop them down one!

A note for vegans: everything on the menu can be ordered vegan, with soy dairy (or, for cheese lovers, with the dairy version).I'm not wild about all of that comfort food stuff. You couldn't pay me to eat fake meatloaf; I've never missed the original. So I would give the current menu about 2.5 - 3 stars. The reason I'm giving the place 4 stars is the AMAZING staff. I've been here at least ten times and have never encountered a server or host who was anything less than spectacular. I can't imagine how they find so many wonderfully friendly, attentive people.The menu highlights for me are definitely the milkshakes (the vegan shakes are awesome, even if you're used to dairy) and the wings. We once went twice in one day for wings and shakes; they're that good. There are other items on the menu that are yummy, like sweet potato fries, but I make those at home, so I don't really feel like they're worth going out for.There's a lot I miss about the Chicago Diner of a couple years ago. They had amazing vegetarian pulled pork tacos last year, and those are gone now. They used to have a wider variety of dishes that didn't involve fake meat, but centered around items like polenta, greens, beans... \u00a0inventive combinations with amazing flavor. And you could pick anything on the menu, and it would be guaranteed amazing... Not so much anymore. The dishes that aren't centered around fake meat seem to fall flat or have sort of one-dimensional flavors. So Chicago Diner is no longer at the top of my list for an all-around delicious dinner.

Recently, my boyfriend ordered the panko crusted tofu and it was so yummy I couldn't believe we were at Chicago Diner and they've really stepped up their vegan dessert game. There's even a daily raw special! But honestly, what I really love about Chicago Diner is that they have a few different options with tempeh. My naturopath (a holistic doctor) told me I should lay off of so much tofu, because all the estrogen in the soybean curd may be throwing off my hormones and such. However, fermented forms of tofu, tempeh and miso, don't have as many hormones and are actually considered better for you. So I love that I can get both tempeh strips, a tempeh sandwich or miso soup here.

Actually, we had received the latest issue of VegNews (literally just before leaving for Chicago) whose cover was designated to vegan restaurants in Chicago (what timing) and Chicago Diner was in the list!I think it's only downside is that it's so popular among vegans and non-vegans that it can get really busy and there will be a wait. It is also a little tight inside but still plenty of elbow room to enjoy and eat. The servers were great but the food was AMAZING! It was all very \"American Food\" and was soooo good. We topped it all off with their peanut butter and cookie dough shake. Loved it! We even had a non-vegan friend with us that really loved it! And the best thing about their menu is that it is LONG, full of TONS of options.I would definitely go back to Chicago just for that!

The waiter told me what was vegan to start and what could be made vegan. It must have taken me 25 minutes to decide what to order, since I wasn't used to being able to order ANYTHING off the menu!I decided on the wings appetizer, salisbury steak entree, cheesecake and chocolate chip milkshake. The wings were to die for. Just the right amount of sweet sticky BBQ sauce AND a vegan dilled ranch sauce. I cleaned my plate so well they probably didn't have to wash the dish! \u00a0The cheesecake was good but the milkshake was INCREDIBLE - thick, creamy, rich, chocolately... well worth the price.The 2nd time I had the wings again, the reuben sandwich, another flavor of cheesecake and another milkshake. The reuben sandwich was INCREDIBLE! Tasted just like I remember reubens from delis. If I could place a weekly order of anything off the menu to ship out West, it would have to be the reuben and milkshake.

The food was muuuuch better this time. I ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. AMAZING. It really hit the spot. My husband ordered the philly cheese steak, which was also good, but not as good as my burger. Mmm I am drooling just thinking about it.HOWEVER. The woman who seemed to be the hostess/manager was extremely rude. First she seated us at a table by the door... which I thought was fine because, even though it was cold outside, there are two doors to the outside so there isn't a breeze when people come in. But my dining partners didn't want to sit by the door, so that's fine. When we asked to be moved to, she told us there weren't any other tables opening up. Fine. She then rudely told us once we were \"seated\" we couldn't move. Which I guess means once we got water and stuff we couldn't move to a different table? Ok, whatever, if that's their policy. A booth opened up a minute later, so we were able to move anyway.However, she struck again at the end of the meal, when we were chatting for about 10 minutes after we got our bill. She came over and actually asked us to leave! I mean, really? It's not like we were sitting there for hours reading books. This is a restaurant, not a fast food place. Yes, I understand there is a wait on a Friday night... and we waited for our table as well. But come on... it's just plain rude to ask a customer to leave their table. I waitressed for 10 years through high school and college, and although it's annoying to have your table occupied when there are customers waiting to be seated, you DEAL WITH IT. I have never asked a customer to get up. Just rude. Sure fire way to get someone to never return.

The hostess was super nice and cute. Told us about 45 minutes and directed us to the heated back waiting area. Luckily, there were some menus out so we were able to look over it before actually getting seated. They bring you to your table through the back door, which goes right through the kitchen. At first i thought it was weird, but after thinking about it, i liked that i was able to see the kitchen. The kitchen (and the cooks!) were clean and i was pleasantly surprised. :)When we were seated we got primo seating... table along the wall, right by the front window. We decided that we were going to split everything we ordered, so we could try as many things as possible. We ordered the \"cheeze\" sticks with homemade marinara and they were delicious! They looked like a shorter version of fried asparagus. The marinara was fantastic!!!!! Hugo ordered the \"Barbecue Bacon Burger\" with sweet potato fries and i ordered the \"fried chicken\" sandwich with macaroni and cheeze. I was fully prepared for the sodium filled veggie burger taste but i was pleasantly surprised! The barbecue sauce was thinner than normal sauce, but it was also sweeter.Im not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, so i wasnt to keen on the fries, but Hugo loved them. THE MAC AND CHEEZE WAS SO GOOD. \u00a0I tried making homemade vegan mac and cheeze but it was terrible, so i was still craving it from a week earlier. It was so good, i retracted our agreement to share everything because i could not even think about sharing it.. We got the peanut butter cake for desert and it was decent. The cake was semi dry, but the caramel and peanut butter was soft and gooey. Just a tip- before i came here, i bought a choc chip cookie made by the diner at Whole Foods and it was so good i couldn't believe it! They sell their cookies in packs of 12 (I think) at the diner, and they are much cheaper than at whole foods (and probably fresher!).I am a huge fan.

I've never had anything here I didn't like, and I love being able to pretty much order anything off the menu.I especially like Chicago Diner for brunch (my favorite meal). Their scrambled tofu is the best I've had at any restaurant, the french toast and blue corncakes are awesome, and I really like the steak and eggs with vegan hollandaise sauce.I also like the vegan buffalo \"wings,\" chicken parmesan sandwich, and the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. (I admit, having grown up in Indiana I like faux meat.) And if it's on the menu, the vegan maki is excellent. The two main failings of Chicago Diner are the desserts and the hit-or-miss service. First off, Chicago Diner prides itself on its vegan desserts, but in my experience they are just awful. The cakes are very dense and very dry. The vegan cheesecake is unpalatable, and the cookies are gritty and crumbly.

There was a \"half-hour\" wait to get inside the restaurant so we waited outside in the cold with a bunch of fellow patrons also waiting to get inside. Oh, and, by the way, these \"regulars\" of the Chicago Diner all reeked of musty hippi stank and patchouli and made the cold air even more unbearable. Soooo, we waited and waited for what was much longer than a half-hour. Finally, we were able to be seated, \u00a0but only at the counter. Now normally, I wouldn't mind sitting at the counter. In fact, I think it's quite fun! It brings back warm childhood nostalgia of sipping milkshakes and blowing papers of straws at the passing people.

BIG MISTAKE. The crap smelled like Alpo and, although I've never tried the dog food, I can't imagine this being too far off in taste.Next course: I had the vegetarian gyros and the bf had a vegetarian rueben. Well, the vegetarian gyros probably wasn't all that bad except that I couldn't really tell what it tasted like since I had to chew through a pound of burnt char. Is char a word? I don't know if it is, but it should be one solely to describe this vegetarian gyros. As for the rueben, I think I saw tears well up in my bf's eyes as he tried to choke the sucker down. Poor little guy. I felt bad for him so I rubbed his little tummy and treated him to a coldstone creamery concoction with TWO mix-ins after din-din.All in all, the wait was bad at this restaurant, the crowded ambience was terrible, service sucked (and was a little hipster-snobby), and the food was pretty bad, as well.

I had arrived incredibly excited to finally have the chance to eat at this super-hyped restaurant only to be disappointed to find that it was just comfort food. There isn't anything wrong with that -- I just thought they had more-gourmet offerings. Now that I can take it for what it is, this time I enjoyed it more.The small diner was pretty crowded for a Wednesday afternoon. There isn't much of a waiting area when you arrive so if you need to wait for a table, you usually do so outside the door to the main dining room. In the summer, they also offer outside seating in the back. The decor is 50's diner style with red diner tables and classic diner chairs. After hemming and hawing over the menu choices, I finally placed my order. I started with an Izze and a small bowl of the macaroni and cheeze. The last time I came here, I didn't care for the macaroni and cheeze, but everyone raves about so I gave it another try. It is basically just noodles with Daiya vegan cheese. I thought it was okay, but certainly not exceptional and nothing special. Nothing really compares with the mac 'n cheese at Soul Vegetarian's Exodus in DC, but that is for another post. \u00a0Another patron actually turned around and asked if that was the best mac 'n cheese I'd ever had and I politely told him that it wasn't and told him about Soul Veg. Come to find out that the couple also travels and eats out at vegan restaurants so we engaged in an interesting discussion. I was there by myself so I didn't mind at all.Based upon my waitress' recommendation, I ordered the Titanic BLT Burger. I half knew that this was not going to be a good idea, but I wanted to try it anyway. I also ordered some ginger garlic flashed greens on the side. This burger was humongous. The seitan patty was made with corn, peppers, and onions and it was topped with Uptons Naturals bacon, cheeze, French-fried onions, lettuce, tomato, and vegan BBQ mayo.When I finally put the top on the burger, I couldn't get it into my mouth -- it was that big. I should have taken this as a sign and not have eaten the whole thing, but I did anyway and paid for it dearly. I liked the seitan burger, but it was just way too big. It all went together well -- even the onion rings. The only thing I didn't really care for was the Uptons Naturals bacon. While it is more like bacon than the tempeh bacon I usually eat, I found it to be rubbery and hard. Next time, I'd prefer not to have the bacon.The ginger garlic kale that I had on the side was fantastic. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly.As a side note, I am really glad that my waitress asked if I wanted vegan cheese when I requested cheese on my burger. I keep forgetting that they are a vegetarian restaurant and that they serve milk products. When I asked my waitress why they don't just go vegan she said that if it was up to her, they would, but the reason they aren't is because they'd lose a lot of their regular patrons. She said the breakfast is popular and they serve a lot of eggs and cheese. That is a shame. But, oh well.Chicago Diner is a great place to go for lunch, but it is easy to eat too much there. After my meal, I actually went into a full-on food coma from eating that entire burger. I actually had to take a nap and felt almost sick -- not from the food, but from eating too much.All in all, the service was great, the prices were reasonable at only $10 per entree, and the food was good comfort food. Although I didn't order dessert during this meal, they are very well-known for their desserts and if you can make room, I'd recommend you try them.

Perhaps the 3 star might have said how I feel about this place (It's ok), but if you're curious as for why, and whether or not \u00a0you'd like it, read on.First off, I don't eat meat, and I dislike any form of fake meat. My dinning companion, on the other hand, eats meat. But he can't have gluten, dairy products, or eggs, so basically the two of us eating out is semi-impossible. But we've managed in the past, and Chicago Diner has gluten free, vegan and vegetarian menus that would serve both of us well. I ordered the Bi Bim Bap, and he ordered a grilled cheese with vegan cheese (lame, I know, but his excuse was that he LOVES grilled cheese, and never really makes it himself, so now is one of the few chances). The food took a bit longer to come out, but the place was packed, so I don't blame them. When our waiter finally delivered out food, both were actually quite small in portion. Mine came with a hefty amount of vegetable, but a rather small scoop of brown rice. His sandwich was small too, but came with a side of fries. As for the taste, mine was good, but not out of this world. Truth is, I ordered this so compare it with my own version of Bi Bim Bap, and I think mine is better. In addition, they came with a \"softer\" version of gochujang (korean red pepper paste) that was a bit too sour for my taste and not spicy enough. I was expecting the real deal, or at least something that comes close to it, but the sauce that came with my dish didn't deliver. In fact, it was rather a let down. The fake meat (which is ironically the part I usually hate the most), was my favorite part of the meal, because it at least had some flavor.The grill cheese was good according to my dinning partner. Our waiter was nice, but nothing special. Place was crowded, and you'd feel like you're screaming at the people sitting at the table next to you, while in fact, you were trying to communicate with each other. So, to sum it up, it was an ok for me. I'm pretty good with cooking vegetable and converting all meals to vegetarian. The Bi Bim Bap definitely wasn't a good choice since I can make a pretty tasty one myself. I should have gone with a sandwich or a wrap. If asked, I would say yes, give it a try. It's somewhat of a Chicago-thing (or maybe Chicago vegetarian thing).

I fell in love instantly! There is no greater feeling for a vegetarian then to look at the whole menu and be able to order ANYTHING and EVERYTHING off of it! It's so liberating! :0) And let me tell you, everything on the Chicago Diner menu is wonderful! I prefer to eat there around their brunch hours, because you get the best of both worlds, the yummy breakfast stuff and lunch options as well. I always try different dishes every time I go and I often drag non veggies with me, and we are always pleased with what we get!For the non veggies out there, let me explain something. The Chicago Diner uses tofu, seitan, and tempeh to give the vegetarian meals some bulk and make it more filling and more interesting. They use these soy products to have \"fake\" bacon, Reuben sandwiches, fillet sandwich, gyros, etc. The list could go on and on! It is amazing what they do with soy! Truly!But don't worry not all things have a soy product in them! They use real eggs, and they have stir fries and other things without the \"fancy veggie soy products\". Some things we have tried and loved: For an App. we all loved the nachos with seitan chorizo.For meals: Cowboy Chili, Black Bean Burger, Radical Reuben, Green Eggs & \"Ham\", the home style potatoes, and pretty much all of the desserts are fantastic! If I had to pick I would say Cookies and Cream cake is my favorite!The atmosphere is very much old time diner, it's pretty small but in a cozy way. The staff is always very friendly and it's always busy, but you never really have to wait that long. But if it is right in the middle of a prime time to eat out, plan on waiting, maybe even outside. So dress warm! But it is completely and totally worth the wait. In the summer, they have a great back patio and they also have parking which is free during the evening and I believe on weekends as well. If you don't like something, if it's not cooked right, just send it back or tell them, they are always happy to please. I got a complimentary dessert when I thought my seitan was a little tough. The Diner is always updating their menu by adding great new dishes, which makes it fun for regulars like me! \u00a0Check out their website, it's really fantastic...has pretty much the whole menu with prices etcI just can't say enough great things about the Diner, my husband and I love it so much that he took me there the night he proposed!

The thinnest layers of sliced seitan cozied up with sauteed onions & peppers and melted cheese all atop a multi-grain baguette.

It had been over a year since my last philly cheeze steak experience, but I revisited Chicago Diner last weekend and was so not disappointed. OH. MY. GOODNESS. I always try and save a half for leftovers but can never do it. I washed it all down with a pitcher of their classic margarita and could not say no to a slice of vegan lemon raspberry cake which our awesome server brought out with a bonus scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream for my two friends and I to enjoy. Both of whom I might add said they were just not down with vegan cake and would likely not be sharing any with me. Ha. We all ate up every last bite of it and agreed it was truly some serious yummyness. \u00a0If you haven't tried one of their vegan cakes, please do yourself a favor and try one! They're dense but delicious, the cookies & cream cake being my particular favorite. And the best part, they can be enjoyed practically guilt free.The atmosphere is warm, friendly and inviting. Situated in a small house in the heart of boys town, I prefer the booths, but the back patio's awfully nice as well, especially in the spring. The servers are usually super friendly and eager to make recommendations. The music is equally cool and only adds to a great background to hang with your buds and enjoy amazingly freshly prepared veggie eats. Afterwards, I suggest moving across the street to the Town Hall Pub for more drinks. My friends bartend there and are some of the nicest girls around. Request some homemade watermelon vodka in your soda and munch on some veggie jerky and you will not be disappointed.

Now, we did go at about 3 in the afternoon, so we had no trouble getting a seat or parking, but that part of town is usually a bitch to park in or around, and I can see how if the Diner got even a little rush, it could be incredibly uncomfortable to wait for seating there.I ordered the Reuben, my hubby had the Polenta Lasagna.My Reuben was as good as any real meat reuben I have ever had-- maybe even better than many. As a side, I ordered tortilla soup: FANTASTIC flavor! The portions were tremendous. I was SO SO happy. The Lasagna, on the other hand, was really just a huge chunk of polenta (a peasant food that, for some reason restaurants charge an assload for -- here it was 12.99, kind of ridiculous) with herbed butter, on a bed of greens, topped with squash, zucchini, and purple onions...*yawn*.

If you're a carnivore looking for an appetizing vegetarian dish, this place blows. To be clear, I don't really like meat substitutes. Since I'm not a vegetarian, when I want the taste of meat, I eat meat. I do however really like vegetarian dishes. A solid mix of veggies or a portobella sub-in for chicken or beef in a pasta dish or burger is kind of my style. Unfortunately the diner has hardly any (I don't remember seeing any, but surely there's a few), dishes that are straight vegetarian without bothering with the meat substitute. I got the avocado tostadas, and they were decent, not amazing. They would have been far better without the quinoa and far better if they actually threw a little salt on the veggies. And the veggies on it (aka bell peppers and onions) were kind of limp and pitiful. I was hoping for something a little more interesting out of the \"grilled veggies.\" Not to mention this is equivalent to a dish I eat a lot in Texas where it rarely runs about $8 unless you're putting fajita meat on it. Try $11 something here. I know vegetarian food can taste a hell of a lot better for cheaper. In fact, I think I can probably steam veggies at home with salt and pepper and be more satiated. So I'll leave this place for the \"meat\" seekers and get my fix elsewhere.I forgot to mention, I tried a bite of my SO's \"pork\" tacos. I'm going to say, I just can't judge them because they were so bad I'm not sure what they were supposed to taste like. Not just the \"pork\" but the taste in general was off. I don't know how else to describe it. They weren't spicy, but they wanted to be spicy. And they weren't flavorful, but they were trying to be.

For years people have been telling me how great it is, and how I just absolutely MUST try it. Sure, I'm not a veggie but I do love me some good vegetarian food. So when my girlfriend asked me to take her here for her birthday, I was happy to comply.The menu appears to change seasonally, which is kind of cool. Lots of items looked really tasty, but I finally settled on the veggie buffalo wings. I've had and made all kinds of veggie buffalo wing flavored foods. I've enjoyed all of them, so I figured it would be a safe bet. I also decided to get chips and salsa, just in case the wings weren't enough. My girlfriend had the avocado tostadas. She was going to order the Pomegranate Wheat beer listed on their specials board, but we were told the board was \"really out of date\" and they were sold out. Fail #1.As we waited, I noticed the music they were playing. Well...I really wouldn't call it music, but more of background noise. It seriously just sounded like weird buzzing noises for a lot of the time. Not exactly what I'd like to eat my meal to.We received our food shortly, and I must say I didn't quite know how to respond to what was put in front of me. Brown, almost black, lumpy logs drenched in sauce. I was a little nervous, but I decided to give it a go. I felt even worse when I had a hard time cutting one of the little logs with my knife. But the worst was when I put it in my mouth - horrible chewy dense texture with a disgusting spicy sauce. This was not even CLOSE to buffalo wing flavor. Maybe they mixed up and gave me BBQ sauce, but either way it was horrid. I managed to choke down one and then I couldn't eat any more. It has been a LONG time since I ordered something I couldn't eat, but I definitely could not finish this.Thankfully my girlfriend's food was the saving grace. Tostadas layered with a spicy black bean paste, topped with grilled veggies, quinoa, and avocado. It was pretty tasty. The chips and salsa were good too, but how do you mess that up?Overall, I'd be willing to give the place another try given the previous reviews.

While it's never been much of an issue when my friends and I grab a bite, the one time I took my grandparents there they were not especially pleased. The main complaint I hear most is of how expensive it is (entrees typically hit the $12 +/- mark). While it certainly won't break the bank, I think you get more bang for your buck at Karyn's which is also vegan (and I think better) while capping out at the same dollar amount. Worth checking out (especially if you live in Chicago) however I think there are better vegetarian friendly restaurants that aren't as expensive and also don't require a 20-30 wait for a table in a cramped, loud room.The outdoor seating is lovely when the weather is more favorable. Also check out their cook book and be sure to hit a dessert too.UPDATED 10/29/11I just ate here a couple of days ago for the first time in about a year and was a little bummed out on the buffalo wings which, for $7, were slim strips of seitan with a light coating of seasoning. Maybe I'm just used to more substantial seitan strips from places like Watercourse in Denver (which SMOKE these in every category).. it was a disappointment. I won't get them again. Six slim strips of under seasoned seitan for $7 sucks. The soul bowl was quite good but a bit pricey. These guys continue to get more expensive however I don't feel the quality has increased.

Booths/tables big enough to eat comfortably with all the food. \u00a0We did select the vegan optoins. \u00a0Our waiter was so nice and outgoing! Great service!He even explained how wine is vegan, as we thought it was a joke, never knew any animal product was used for wines/beers. We were educated by our waiter while eating great food!Red pepper hummus, Meat Nachos (meat was seitan and delicious), Enchiladas with rice and beans was very good!Chocolate vegan shake my daughter enjoyed. We split a huge dessert Cookies & Cream vegan cake with a side of vegan icecream, yummy!Definitely recommend giving this place a chance.

I mean burned black on the bottom. Did they think I wouldn't notice when I took a bite?

He may have licked the little container clean, and definitely didn't balk at the seitan sausage. We both agreed that the herb flaked biscuit was superb. Standard breakfast fare is also abound- the portions are large but not too large, if you get my meaning. Coffee comes in huge cups and they're very generous with refills, a necessity for an establishment with \"diner\" in the title. \"Seitan bacon\" (although it's more fun to use the incorrect spelling) tastes nothing like bacon and everything like smoked tofu, just how I like my fake meats. We also tried the vegan cinnamon roll-- OmniBoyfriend said \"this tastes nothing like vegan food.\" I'm pretty sure that means: tasty.

As for sides, I usually get the sweet potato fries, the mac and cheeze, or the kale - very different options, but each delightful. I've also been for brunch once: what I remember most was the biscuit and gravy, which was delicious.As far as I can tell, it's less busy during the week than it is on weekends (natch), and you probably wouldn't want to come with a large group regardless (although I've never eaten on their patio, so it may be a bit more spacious). The food's a little on the pricey side - I don't think I've seen an entree for under $7.99 - but well worth it, and comes up faster than you may expect, even when it's busy.Why not a perfect 5/5? The food's a little inconsistent. Sometimes the mac and cheeze is dynamite, sometimes it's bland. Sometimes the buffalo wings are cooked to perfection, sometimes they're a little on the tough/dry side.

There was no flavor, and for a meat eater maybe its because I believe it so so hard to honestly duplicate the taste. It seemed a little dry. Now for the eggs, to me an egg is an egg, cage free, free range whatever they all taste the same. The potato-tempeh hash was very delicious. It had red pepper, green peppers, and cubed potatoes and tempeh. I must say though the best was the biscuits. They were awesome very fluffy and so yummy. I am not sure what the sauce was that was served on them since it lacked flavor. The coffee was very strong (no complaints here.) My sister ordered the miso corn chowder which she said was pretty good, a large fresh orange juice, and ordered a cobb salad to go which looked huge with seitan meat strips. Our bill was $34.

I would say that if you gave up meat because you dislike the taste of meat, some of these dishes might not be for you. Their chicken fried steak fooled my meat eating friends.

The food is sourced from local farmers. The ingredients used in the food are of exceptional quality and prepared with high standards. The service is always punctual and friendly. The prices are excellent for the quality of food and service one receives. I love the quesadillas and soups. The only bad food experience I had was with the dumplings. I felt that the dumplings' dough was far too thick and \u00a0tasted raw. The stuffing in the dumplings is so bland and boring that no dipping sauce could redeem them. The waitress very kindly exchanged it for me which I really appreciated. In addition, I did not like the coconut cake. It was so heavy in my stomach I felt pretty sick afterwards. It looks so soft and fluffy I thought it was be like sweet air but it tasted more like a sweet tub of margarine. My suggestion is to cull that coconut cake and replace it with a mixed berry tart (no cream) just a mix of seasonal berried in a nice pie crust sprinkled with some stevia or drizzled with a bit of honey.
