Whenever one of them visits, they request 'the best deep dish' in Chicago. I've tried about 15 different pizza places since i've been here and although a lot are close, and ALWAYS delicious; Uno, Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, I have to say, they all lose their shit over Pequod's. The toppings are plentiful and always taste fresh, the tomato sauce is signature and their crust is unlike anything i've had, it's caramelized and impossible not to finish (I usually never finish the crust).* During Peak hours, there's about an hour wait, The Drinking Bird next door to Pequod's has great cocktails!", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Daniel E.", "ReviewID": "p7nxDLxB59bWsTzn1bBQLw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very tasty! Visiting from out of town and given many recommendations of where to get deep dish, but Pequod's was the most recommended from friends. Not disappointed at all. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, but were seated in less than 15. The appetizer combo was not bad - the jalepeno poppers were the best, so I think I would have just gone with those.Our deep dish was super yummy and surprisingly not too heavy. I've had deep dish before that left me feeling \u00a0uncomfortably full, but this deep dish was filling without the gross greasy feeling afterwards. We got mushrooms and fresh garlic toppings that were very fresh and delicious.

After recommending this place to everyone I know who visits my hometown, I'm thinking my endorsements may have been a mistake. I defend this place A LOT against warnings of insufferable service and bad crowd control. I am willing to cut them a lot of slack for their pizza. It is an attraction for which a bad personality is sometimes forgivable. And I've been coming long enough that I know better than to expect reliable service on a Saturday, or to attempt a table during the NBA playoffs. But on a Tuesday night, in the summer offseason with zero sports, you'd think the expectation of actually getting to eat the pizza you called in 20 minutes prior that was put in 'right away' is reasonable. Yeah?We order at 6:30. We get there after a cross-town trek. We think we're fine, since there's no wait when we called, and the order went in awhile ago. We go to check in amid largely vacant tables... and are told it'll be a 40 minute wait JUST to sit. What?Pequods, I get it. Your justification makes sense, it's just not very good. I work in customer service, and I know there's 'technically' no responsibility for you to update patrons (who already ordered and are headed to your restaurant) that an influx of HUGE parties has added 40 minutes to your previously nonexistent wait, but when you are bitchy about it on arrival, and act like it's unreasonable to be taken by surprise by this development, that's what stops fans from endorsing you. Did you have to call? No. If you had? You would've saved your loyal customers $20 in cab fare, a shitload of traffic, respect, and a wasted pizza. My life isn't your problem, I get that, but there's a courtesy in not springing this on a party for whom you've already told you're cooking food for. That's how you become a restaurant whose patron recommendations start carrying warnings.I've happily put up with the unpredictability on weekends or during sports events, but as a loyal recommender of this place, I'm really disappointed. I don't whine. I just want whoever monitors this to know that it's becoming a reputation people are listening to. Also, there were a ton of open tables given parties of 40 and 25 were supposedly occupying the bulk of the place, but given everything else I guess I'm not shocked we have a difference in logic.

There's actually very little tomato sauce and the toppings lie on top (compared to ones I've had before which were filled with a tomato sauce / topping mixture).What I really like is the caramelized cheese edges, so crispy! I also like that despite all the wet toppings on top, the bread on the bottom below the cheese remained completely dry! Not soggy at all! I think that's a huge feat to accomplish. For these two things alone, I give this place 4 stars. Also, the slices are huge! I shared a small pizza ( 4 slices) with one other person, and was pretty satisfied after just 1 slice.

First off I'd have to say that pizza is unusual and different from chicago's most famous deep dish places. Toppings were very generous. Ultimately I was not a fan of the crust or the sauce which was sweeter than average. I've wanted to like this place and gone back a couple of times.

Pequod's is located caddy corner to a fairly new shopping center, with a movie theatre, Barnes and Nobles, etc.Parking 3/5Fairly easy. Found street parking a couple blocks down. There is lot parking across the street, but we didn't want to have to pay.Ambience 3/5The place essentially looks like a long sports bar (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ\u2026). Bar on the left as you walk in, and most or all of the tables are stool height. Restrooms are in the back across from the kitchen and are pretty clean for a sports bar.Service 4.5/5Actually really good. This earned them the fourth star for me. Our server was really nice, and checked in with us pretty regularly. There was a mix up with our order (I'll get to that later), but she fixed it by giving us half off our food bill. She didn't have too, but the fact that she did was pretty awesome of her.Wait time 1/5Seating - BWaited about 20 minutes for seats. Not badDrinks - AOrdered a pitcher of 312 of the menu (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ\u2026) and this came out quick.Food - FExpect to wait longer for deep dish, but this time there was a mix up with our order. The tables around us all got their food before us. We ended up not getting our food for almost an hour and a half. By the time it showed up we were hungry and grumpy. However, we were not as grumpy as we could have been, as the server told us beforehand that she would take half off the price of food for us.Food 4/5Jalapeno poppers - 3/5They didn't suck and they tied us over.....kind of.Large Pepperoni Sausage and Onion (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ\u2026) - ABomb. Very comparable to Lou Malnati's. I'm a huge fan of deep dish, since I don't eat it very often. I'm not a big fan of pepperoni in general (shame on me), but everyone else wanted it.Small Sausage Mushroom and Basil (yelp.com/biz_photos/pequ\u2026) - A-Very tasty but the crust was a bit burnt. Not enough to make it a crappy meal, but then again we had been waiting for over an hour for this. Overall 4/5Food was good, and the service staff did an amazing job trying to make us happy despite of the mix up in the kitchen. Sometimes $h!t happens, but it's all about how they react to it that sets them above other restaurants.

The dense vessel of bread augmented with a vertical growth of irrelevant toppings and something like an inch of cheese is more like pie, or bad lasagna... or some other obscene thing characterized by gross excessiveness rather than a relationship to that majestic food form we call pizza.That said, Pequod's serves up a damn delicious deep dish \"pizza\" (yes, you still need a fork to eat it).The difference between Pequod's and the other, very overrated Chicago deep-dish heavyweights is that Pequod's lines the cast-iron pan with cheese before baking the pizza. The result is a beautifully blackened edge of, yep, fried cheese - that holds the pizza together instead of becoming soggy after a minute and breaking off from the rest of the pie. The crust is also slightly thinner than the refined carb parties of Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, both of whom have totally mediocre deep-dish due to a dry monster crust of solid bread and an avalanche of cheese and too-sweet sauce that slides off the second you lift your slice out of the pan.Our medium \"pan pizza\" (as they call it) with jalapenos and mushrooms cost $20 and was ready for pickup in 30 minutes. The restaurant looks like a regular old Chicago bar: low-key, dirty worn wooden floors, maybe you'd see lots of daisy dukes if it had been warm enough.

Not terrible but as far as a foundation for a pie its nothing exciting.The Sauce - If there were any herbs or spices in the sauce, I couldn't taste them. Pizza suffers the most when the sauce is bad and this was just tomato paste and sugar with maybe a sprinkle of pepper.The Cheese - this was the most disappointing part of the whole meal, there was no flavor and no salt. My professional guess is that they use a cheap skim milk mozzarella, no provolone or whole milk. It reminded me of peal and eat mozzarella sticks from a gas station, but that would be insulting cause at least those are loaded with sodium.The Toppings - the second worst part about this pizza, it was adorned with about 10 pieces of sausage the size of golf balls and what was probably 3 leaves of furiously fine shredded basil.

This place was a serious deep dish pizza spot mixed with a sports bar. If you lived in Chicago, you probably have had Lou Malnati's Pizzeria and Giordano's Pizza which are both GREAT traditional Chicago deep dish pizza however Pequod's Pizza takes it to another level with a caramelized deep dish pizza crust. Do NOT let that crust scare you. The burnt cheese caramelized crust is amazing! Let's not forget about the rest of the pizza! They build their deep dish pizza just as good as Lou Malnati's Pizza and Giordano's Pizza. A small deep dish pizza comes out to be 4 slices of heaven and just right for two people. Throw down on some local beer and your meal will be perfect! The original location is in Morton Grove which still exist today. It is also a smaller place but not as busy as the Chicago location. Wait times at the Chicago location can get up to 2 hours specially when there is a game playing. They do not take reservations but BEST TIP is to call ahead and put your name on the waiting list. The service was great and they were on top of everything even when they were busy with a wait at 2+ hours. Great vibe in the place especially when there is a game on. You cannot even tell they had a fire in the place at one point (January 2006) which they shut down for six months to rebuild.

Also, I've never been to Lou Malnati's so I can't compare the two. I just know that Pequod's was really, REALLY good.We had reservations at 6:30pm. Their version of \"reservations\" is basically priority seating, you still have to wait a bit depending on how many people are there. I'd recommend waiting outside (if it's not too chilly) because it's quite crowded inside around dinner time and you can get bonked on the head or jabbed in the back with some pizza pans. Also while you're waiting, you can start looking at the menu and deciding what you want. You can even order before you sit down! Something I wish we had known..We sat down and ordered a pitcher of Goose Island 312. Great local beer, btw. The three of us also ordered cheesy garlic bread for starters. We were reluctant since we knew there would be a lot of carbs to be consumed with our deep dish, but went for it anyways. It was one of the best decisions ever.A common mistake that people make is forgetting this is deep dish. Usually it would be perfectly fine for 3 people to get a large 14\" NY style pizza, but since this was Chicago style, we downsized to a medium 10\" (sausage, mushroom, onion) and still struggled to finish. There were 6 slices and we all struggled finishing the last one.

There are several reasons why this Lincoln Park treasure, quietly nestled on northeast side of Clybourn dominates the deep.Peqoud's uses a great blend of mild spices to season their crispy, yet soft and chewy dough. The cooking process infuses these flavors that delightfully accent their robust marinara and enhance the flavor of the mild cheese. The secret to their amazingness is actually their crust. A generous layer of burnt cheese that every voluptuous bite tantalized you towards. The first bite of the crust will spiral you into a Peqoud's obsession!My standard topping have become extra cheese, meatball and jalape\u00f1o. It's a great balance of savory and heat balanced by the excessively perfect amount of milky, deLISHous cheese.

The manager was put on the phone and instead of apologizing, \u00a0angrily told me that because we had eaten slices, we would have to PAY for a new pizza to be delivered. When I pointed out that this didn't really make sense, as we had already waited a long time, and the mistake was theirs, she pointed out that \"if we sent you another pizza, then our owner would be out TWO pizzas\" .No apology, no attempt to make it right. Peaquods solution was that we should wait 3 hours for the right pizza and give them back the other pizza so that they could deliver it as well. I don't know what pizza place would be ok with sending a 3 hour old pizza that had been misdelivered and sitting in someone else's house for the night to customers that had been waiting and spending a good amount of money ($30 for one large pizza delivered) for a fresh hot pizza. The manager was beyond rude to me, and insisted that the only way they could get me the correct pizza, was to charge me for it, or have me accept a smaller pizza. We accepted the smaller pizza, and it did not arrive until Midnight, over 3 hours after we initially ordered. I have NEVER been treated so rudely or expected to not only wait on but PAY for a mistake that a restaurant made. I have eaten at Pequods about once a month for years, and as a coach, often take my sports teams there for end of season parties. I hate to say it because I love the pizza so much, but I don't think I'll be going back there again after being treated so poorly and rudely.", "Date": "2014-06-02", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Andrea J.", "ReviewID": "Kfx-QBYT3RAErxOQbxCRAA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've heard so much about this pizza that I was excited when coworkers decided get together and order some. \u00a0They ended up ordering a sausage, bacon and pepperoni pizza.

First you must recognize the difference between pan pizza and deep dish/stuffed pizza. If you're looking for a cheese overdose and are expecting that mozza string that only breaks when you're holding the paddle a foot over your head, that is not this pizza, that is stuffed pizza. I prefer the \"light\" and fluffy crust of pan pizza to the thickly packed, flattened down cornmeal covered deep dish crust. Admittedly no there is not a ton of cheese on here, but I don't think that's too bad of a thing, especially when they offer extra cheese. I remember having Lou Malnati's for the first time and feeling disappointed. I don't like the patty layer of sausage, and with a lot of stuffed pizza places the toppings are under the cheese, which I really don't care for. The toppings should be crispy on top with a little char, not soggy floating around in cheese. Peqoud's took every tweak I would make in other pan pizza formulas and applied the changes I would make to create the perfect pie. LOL @ the review that said the cheesy garlic bread looked like they just added butter, garlic, and cheese to the bread wtf did you think cheesy garlic bread would have on it, foie gras? The caramelized cheese crust, I don't even need to tell you about, you've already heard it. Service is spot on, not in your face every minute, but your glass is never empty. The place is deceivingly larger than you think because they have an upstairs, so don't be discouraged if it looks full when you walk in! Anyway the pizza is also gorgeous, I remember finishing a huge slice and being full, and the table next to us was just getting their pie delivered to their table and I was like \"Ooo I want that.

My friend ordered 4 types of deep dish pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, and spinach). I had a slice of the sausage and mushroom. It was decent. LOTS of crust though.

I've been to Giordano's, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and now this one and Gino's East will be my \"go-to\" places for pizza on my Chicago trips.The wait wasn't terrible - on a Saturday evening, we had a party of 8 call ahead to be put down on the list, and we waited for 5-10 minutes when we got there. Much better than the lines at Gino's East, and I love the fact that you can call ahead of time to get put on a \"priority list\" for faster seating when you get there.As an appetizer, we got wings which were pretty unmemorable, and a fried sampler assortment ($8.95) of mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks and jalapeno poppers. Everything was fried in the same batter, so it was pretty much a guess as to what you were actually eating until you put it in your mouth. I liked the deep fried mushrooms that I had, but I like most deep-fried things. The Cheesy Garlic Bread ($3.95) is just okay. Save your carbs for the pizza. Ditto on the salad - it was good and made us feel slightly better about carb-heavy dinner, but it was nothing to write home about.The pizza on the other hand was phenomenal. The crust was crispy and not soggy in the middle; the tomato sauce was the right proportion and the amount of cheese was just right. I loved both the pepperoni pizza and the sausage & spinach pizza that we got. I think less toppings is more when it comes to ordering, so that the toppings don't completely overwhelm the crust, tomato, and cheese. The large size is pretty generous, and being 8 girls, most people ate 1.5 slices each.The price is affordable too - we paid $25 a piece which included beer, appetizers, salad, and 2 large pizzas (split between 8 people).

That's cool, though. It still tastes pretty good, and I've yet to meet a native Chicagoan who will fight to the death to defend his city's pizza as the finest creation known to man.That said, I've eaten my fair share of deep dish and figured it's always good to have a place in your back pocket for when the family and friends come to visit. I've done the big three gauntlet and Lou Malnati's is my winner. However, I asked around for the best \"local\" spot to grab a deep dish slice, and the answer came back Pequod's.Pequod's is small, grungy, and really looks like half a bar than serves pizza on the side. But aside from all that, Pequod's actually makes a rather nice pie. There's nothing special on the menu, just the basics. Start with a cheese, and ingredient your way up.I was already massively hungry, so we ordered jalapeno poppers to start. I'll take the cheddar/yellow/orange filling over cream cheese any day of the week, so Pequod's already got off the blocks well. Still not as good as Jack in the Box, which makes an incomparable popper. But good.Pequod's deep dish, unlike the Big 3, isn't overzealous with the bread. It's still a chore to eat, but for different reasons. Pequod's says it caramelizes its crust, but what that really means is they char it to a crisp. For a guy that loves blackened anything (especially char on brisket), I loved it. Aside from the char, the breading is thinner than the typical deep dish, and much easier to eat. The sauce is plentiful (another check mark in my book), and although I'd heard that Pequod's goes easy on the cheese, the white stuff was still overkill for me.

The crust: puffy and crispy on the outside, but there's more...Pequod's pan pizza has caramelized (read: burnt) cheese on the outer crust, which is created by laying slices of cheese up against the inside wall of the pan and letting it run down around the outside of the crust as it rises and bakes (there is no \"sprinkling\" involved).This cheesy, crispy outer char-crust is the reason you come here.When ordering, make sure you order the PAN pizza and not the thin crust. The thin, although not bad (I've had better thin crust), does not have this crunchy cheesy goodness on it's outer crust, and you will leave disappointed, like many New Yorkers seem to have already done on Yelp.Keep the number of toppings to a minimum. I recommend only 2 toppings at a time, but I wouldn't go over 3. Don't go overboard or you will lose the greatness of this pizza in all of the toppings. Avoid anchovies at all costs!My fellow Pequod-a-holics and I have come up with a consensus of good combinations; here are a few of our favorites:Pepperoni and Garlic - You really can't go wrong with this one (My personal favorite).Italian Sausage and Pepperoncini (spicy yellow peppers) - for the people who like a little heat.Italian Sausage and ... just about anything - They have great Italian Sausage at Pequod's.Pepperoni / Sausage combo - best of both worlds.Spinach and Garlic - a classic combo (even better with Italian Sausage).The Heartstopper - You could ask for it by name, but they won't know what the heck you're talking about.

Why can't things like cheese and butter be good for you? The pizza is generously drenched in the tomato sauce but I didn't mind because it was thick, robust, and zesty.

Seriously, I do not know how I am going to be able to order and eat pizza in Saint Louis again. I was in Chicago for business and meet up with two local Yelpers, Lupe d. and Damian P. for lunch. If it were not for their hospitality I would have never discovered Pequod's and true pizza.Side note: Meeting up with a fellow Yelper is easier then someone on those Internet dating sites. Yelpers post \"real and current\" pictures. Both Damian and I started out with a Pequot Salad (Half Size). What attracted me to this amazing salad, is that they use no Iceberg lettuce. I have a strong dislike for Iceberg and was thrilled that they use Romaine. They then garnish it a variety of fresh vegetable toppings, pepperoni, pepperoncini and cheese. If it were not for Lupe being a regular and alerting us to take note of the cheese. Damian and I both would missed the detail that the cheese is sliced in the shape of a whale. Another big bonus point is that they always serve the salad dressing on the side in a little cup. Besides the conversation and meeting fellow Yelpers from another city, the piece of resistance was the pizza itself. \u00a0Being a man from Saint Louis, I am use to thin crust and not a fan of \"deep dish pizza\". \u00a0However, when I saw the description how they make their pan pizza on the menu, I was sold. Pizza prepared in cast iron pans that have been blackened by decades of seasoning, is a winner.

My personalized 7\" size pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage and jalape\u00f1o blew me away. I will tell you, Pequod's does not skimp on toppings, the tomato sauce is rich and the mozzarella cheese melted perfectly. The service was friendly.

Well, if you've never had it, here's the straight talk: caramelized crust = burnt cheese crust. They put extra cheese on the edge so that it \"caramelizes\" but it's not really a dark golden char, like maybe a grilled cheese would produce. It's burnt. As in black. As in potentially-cancer-inducing burnt. If you're into that, then this is your place. As for me, um, no thanks.Jet's Pizza is caramelized. Pequod's is burnt. Simple as that.What's more, one of our two pizzas had a burnt crust on the bottom. The servers didn't seem to care a lick about it. When we talked to the manager, he shrugged his shoulders and said the pizza happened to be in a hotter spot in the stove. OK. But we still don't like burnt-bottom-crust pizza. After some more (polite) discussion, the manager gave us a replacement pizza...but of course we had to wait another 20 minutes for it.On the plus side, there was a generous amount of sauce and the sausage had a nice flavor to it.

Even without the burned rim the crust is amazing. \u00a0The fact that there isnt a ton of cheese in their pizza also makes this my favorite. \u00a0I hate when you're eating deep dish and your slice gets cold, which causes the cheese to seize up into this rubbery disk of dairy. \u00a0And every bite you take, you hate yourself more for. \u00a0These kind of shenanigans don't happen when you eat Pequod'sMy best friend who used to live here came to visit, along with his girlfriend. \u00a0So on our \"Chicago exclusive\" touristy day, Pequod's was where we took them for a late lunch. \u00a0My wife got a spinach and tomato personal, and the three of us split a sausage, mushroom and garlic large. \u00a0Holy balls. \u00a0I've had garlic on pizza before, but this was insane. \u00a0When they put the pie onto the whale trivet, the garlic aroma was so overpowering it hit everyone in the face and we all got black eyes. \u00a0I LOVE GARLIC. \u00a0My mouth is watering as I type these words...Giant chunks of sausage, large pieces of fresh mushroom and minced garlic everywhere, and the crust? \u00a0Oh, that crust \u00a0And that smelly garlic. \u00a0I'm glad I'm married and not looking because I felt like you could smell the pizza on me for three days after the meal. \u00a0I guess it didn't help that we had leftovers and I kept topping off my garlic smell level. \u00a0Pequod's is the perfect deep dish, for me and my wife at least. \u00a0In the 12 years that I've known her, never once has she had a craving for deep dish. \u00a0She's a cracker thin crust kind of gal. \u00a0Since we've eaten Peaquod's though, it's about a 4 week interval on the deep dish craving. \u00a0This fact alone is all you need to know how special Pequod's is. \u00a0Now go get some!I'm coming with you...", "Date": "2012-12-29", "Author_Location": "Carpentersville, IL"}, {"Author": "David N.", "ReviewID": "gsEbjJGavw6V62kVqUQYKg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Freaking amazing pizza.

We know it's \u00a0really, REALLY good pizza. But as a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I find myself frustrated with the many ill-informed reviews I read about our city's pizza. So I feel it's necessary to give my two cents on the matter to clarify the situation. Consider this your Chicago Style Pizzas 101. Beginning with the following:Pequod's is NOT -- I repeat -- NOT Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza. People assume that because the sauce is on top and it's cooked in a deep black pan, it must be deep dish. Well, that's incorrect. There are three types that are often labeled as \"Deep Dish\" which, while true they're all cooked in a \"deep dish,\" only one of those types actually qualifies as \"Chicago Style Deep Dish pizza. The difference is really about the crusts. A Chicago Style Deep Dish's crust is not overly thick and not really bready, but more like a pie crust (buttery, flaky). It often has an outer crust that's elevated above the rest of the dough, as if it were saying \"I am your master. WORSHIP ME.\" \u00a0Examples are Gino's East and Lou Malnati's. Giordano's, Edwardo's and Art of Pizza are Stuffed Pizzas -- usually a similar crust as the deep dish, but they all have a really thin layer of dough on top of all of the toppings, which is covered with sauce (the sauce doesn't come in actual contact with most of the toppings in the prep, other than a small hole in the middle of it).Pequod's is PAN pizza. Yes, akin to Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza -- thick, bready-inside, slightly crispy-outside crust cooked in a pan. And that's where the similarities end.Because I've already written a mini-non-fiction here, I will be brief: Pequod's was a breath of fresh air to my tastebuds and could evolve to my new favorite place to get a 'Za in the city, Everything was balanced, and that carmelized cheese edge --- ohhhh man....The wait for a table and for our pizza was long, but as the old adage goes, \"Good things come to those who wait.\"If I want deep dish, I'm going to Lou's.

The place was jam packed and many who didn't have reservations chose not to wait an hour and a half to get a table. \u00a0They allow you to place your pizza order only (no apps,etc.) while you wait to be seated. \u00a0There were roughly 20 people stuffed by the entry door waiting to be seated, which I'm sure was not thrilling to diners sitting at the nearby tables, or to the servers who constantly fought their way through the sea of people trying to do their jobs. \u00a0However, none of that was an issue for us.We ordered wings and fries for apps and a large cheese pan pizza. \u00a0For $8.95 you get 8-10 wing-halves (4-5 full wings). \u00a0For $3.95 you get a small plate of little fries. \u00a0The apps were good but standard. Now, the pizza; it's a huge piece of bread. \u00a0It looked delicious when brought to our table and when we were served the first slice it had the gooey cheesy look you see in commercials. \u00a0A few minutes in however, we realized we were eating nothing but a large crust with a thin slice of cheese on top with a smattering of sauce. \u00a0The sauce is very good and the carmelized crust \u00a0has a terrific texture to it. \u00a0It's very light in the middle with a crunchy bottom, but there's not much more to report. \u00a0My wife loves pizza and was very disappointed given all the rave reviews of this place on Yelp.The overwhelming crust and scant toppings got so bad that by the second slice she had stopped biting into the pie and turned it sideways so she would only get half the dough along with the cheese and sauce. \u00a0I went back to the initial website I saw that named Pequod's as one of Chicago's 'eight best pizzas' and realized that they recommended it be ordered with extra cheese and extra sauce. \u00a0I have to say that is pretty much spot on. \u00a0Ordering their pie any other way gets you nothing more than focaccia bread. \u00a0 I should have checked that site before we went. \u00a0 We plan to try maybe one more of these north side pizza places so many people gush about and that'll be all. \u00a0For the time being however, the next time we go out for pizza, it will be to one of the mainstays, (Lou Malnati's, Home Run Inn on 31st, Uno's downtown, Giordano's in Hyde Park, etc.)We took home half of the pizza and never even bothered to reheat the leftovers; we forgot all about them, then tossed it.", "Date": "2013-12-08", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Josh B.", "ReviewID": "8Tt1j_0I1WrVfULVjvvPOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent food, excellent service, and one hell of a super star delivery gal named Sydney.

And what do you know: it's now one of our favorite pizza spots. Located in a good area with lots of shopping and even a movie theater across the street, this place starts off great. You walk in, there is always a line up so you put your name down and stand with the crowd with a pager in your hand. In the mean time, you can order your pizza so that when it's time for you to be seated, the pizza won't be too long. Since this is a sports bar as well, it is very crowded but lively. Don't let the place fool you because there is another floor upstairs with lots of seating room. We sat upstairs both times that we visited. The appetizers are also fresh and tasty. But let's talk about the thick crust pizza: it's NOT like pizza UNO, like Giordano's, or any other deep dish pizza you might think of. This is in a class of its own. The deep dish pizza is covered with the toppings you want which is one thing I like to see...more toppings than cheese. As you bite into, or cut into the pizza, you notice that even though it is thick crust, it's not too soft or too hard or full of dough. Somehow, the thick crust isn't as dough-like as you would think and therefore, not as filling as you would think. It's perfect! The outer crust area on top has their special touch to it: it is burnt cheese all around the top which gives it more of a different flavor when added to the pizza takes the whole experience to another level.

We ordered two medium deep dish pizzas, one with pepperoni and onion, and one with spinach and mushroom, the latter I had a heavy hand in designing since those are the best veggies paired with ooey gooey cheese. I think I need to expand my vocabulary because \"yummy\" doesn't quite do the flavors justice. Pequod's signature caramelized cheese is a winner, especially if you like burn in a good toasty way. One interesting aspect of their pizzas is that the crust is more crunchy, or crouton-like rather than bread-like. While we chatted animatedly while waiting for the pies, we became quieter upon encountering their deliciousness firsthand and focusing our energies on gobbling slice after slice. Soon our party of five (including three guys with large appetites) were satiated, plus we had a slice leftover. Best of all, it was quite an inexpensive meal at ~$12 per person, considering we got a salad in addition to pizza and that we were in a big city, where I automatically assume everything is pricier. By the time we left the two floors of the restaurant were pretty full, so I believe Pequod's serves excellent true Chicago deep dish pizza more appealing to locals. The only problem with the experience is that now I crave Pequod's when I'm back at home.

The winner goes to Pequod's Pizzeria.This place has the most variety in terms of appetizer selections. I believe appetizers are important for deep dish pizza-serving restaurants largely due to the expectation that these pizzas take longer to make than thin crust ones. In addition, the Pequod's salad is pretty decent (the creamy garlic sauce is clutch). As for the pizza itself, I was astonished. The crust, including the bottom, was crispy and solid. This is difficult to come by. I've always experienced softer/soggier bottom crusts due the way that deep dish pizzas are made in general. In addition, I'm a huge fan of their sausage topping. I definitely think they use a better grade of sausage than other pizza places. The most impressive thing I noticed at Pequod's is the relatively short amount of time it takes to bake the pizzas. I daresay it was the fastest I've seen a Chicago-style deep dish pizza come out. Service is great, the pizza is superior, and prices are relatively cheaper than those at similar restaurants.

It's not the deepest I'm told, but still intimidating for a girl raised on Wolfgang Puck. The atmosphere is fun and raucous, not good for an intimate date but perfect for a catchup with a friend. Our waitress was not incredibly attentive, but it may have been because we were clearly deep in conversation and she didn't want to disturb us, which I appreciate. When the pizza came I was pretty sure even my beer and a half wasn't going to stimulate my appetite enough to tackle my portion of it. Indeed, I only got partway through my second slice because my companion mocked my lack of Chicago spirit. The first bite was exquisite. The crust is lovely and the ingredients were well distributed; fresh tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and an ever-so-slightly crispy bottom. Everyone talks about their caramelized crust, but it's worth mentioning again because it truly does distinguish them.The second time I popped in for their lunch special, I was disappointed, particularly considering my agreeable first experience. My main issue was the service. I waited about ten minutes for my waitress to return after giving me a menu, and the restaurant was not busy by any stretch of the imagination. Eventually I asked the girl behind the bar and she ended up serving me for the most part while my waitress walked past me over and over, completely ignoring me. Perhaps she was blind in one eye and I should be kinder, but my guess is she just didn't care much.The pizza was still good, but didn't wow me like the first time. Perhaps it was that the smaller pizzas don't come in the skillet and therefore aren't protected from the elements, or perhaps it was that the atmosphere contributed heavily to my enjoyment. Whatever the case, I was underwhelmed by the lunch special - $5 is a great deal for a personal pizza, but you have to dine in and the presentation leaves something to be desired.

They don't take reservations but did allow us to register for priority seating at 8:30 - whatever that means. Also - you can put in your order while you wait, which is nice.We ordered a half cheese/half sausage deep dish. They are famous for their caramelized crust. The chef spreads a thin layer of cheese on the outside of the crust, which causes it to have a charred, burned look - and gives it a chewy texture. I liked the texture, but a few pieces were so chewy that it bordered on tough and I had trouble cutting it with my fork.The sausage was flavorful \u00a0- I wished it had more on it because it was so good.

It looks like a a philly bread that's split in half and it has their marinara sauce, great amount of garlic, and cheese. \u00a0You HAVE to try these!! We had a medium size pan pizza with 2 ingredients and it was reasonably priced. Definitely ask your server what their recommendations are as far how big you want your pizza to be because we didn't listen (and thinking we're hungrier than we actually were) and got the medium, instead of recommended small for me, my husband and a baby. \u00a0Service is great and the quality of food is great! I like that they melt mozzarella to their crust that makes that crunchy crust. their home made marinara sauce is really good too!The Bad - I can't say any bad things about this place.

So here is my two cents on the 'Quod's experience:Pequods has the most amazing deep dish pizza EVER!!! Yes, better than Uno's, Due's, Gino's, Malnatti's and your Momma's pie combined. They are known famously for their \"burnt crust\" which is cheesy, crunchy, caramelized and pretty much one of the best things I've ever tasted - I usually work my way around the outside of the pizza and snack on it alone. Good sauce to cheese/ingredients ratio and the sauce itself is also tangy, chunky and delish. Just one side note... if you don't dig the deep dish so much and prefer a thin-crust DO NOT GO HERE. I've had to learn several times through trial and (really bad) error that Pequod's can't do thin crust.

(Dessert only if we felt we could truly handle it.)So here's the experience at Pequod's Pizzeria (our third stop of the two):That's right, we were convinced to add a 3rd contender to our ultimate deep-dish competition. \u00a0Who convinced us? \u00a0Food Network magazine. \u00a0They had a special in a recent issue about the best pizza in every state, and we jumped to Illinois to find out if Food Network chose Uno or Lou, and we read that... \u00a0what the heck is a \"Pequod's Pizzeria\"??We hit the 'net, and found out that on my two recent trips up to Webster to hit up Barnes & Noble and the awesomeness of Five Guys, I was walking RIGHT PAST this place.Well at about 4:30pm on a Sunday, we changed all that and entered the building for supposedly the best deep-dish 'zza Chicago has to offer, complete with caramelized cheese on the crust for that extra-savory flavor.Well, we got ourselves a seat and thumbed through the menu for our fried appetizer. \u00a0Boom! \u00a0Appetizer Combo: sign us up!After Lou Malnati's, my girlfriend had finally come to terms with fried zucchini, and these slices o' veggie were quite good. \u00a0She enjoyed the mozz sticks, since I'm the only fried mushroom fan. \u00a0They were quite tasty as well. \u00a0Poppers on an appetizer platter is just icing on the cake - good choice, Pequod's!And with proper timing, our pizza arrived. \u00a0Now THIS was the kind of deep-dish pepperoni pizza I was expecting. \u00a0The pepperoni had a great flavor and lovely crispiness to them. \u00a0The sauce was a FREAKIN' SAUCE! \u00a0Barely any chunks of tomato to be found! \u00a0I was in heaven! \u00a0And then the crust, with the caramelized cheese (which is a very fancy term for \"we just throw some extra cheese on the crust so it gets burnty/crunchy in the oven\") really does make all the difference, especially with the level of butter you can tell went into the dough.My only qualm with the pizza was the ratio of dough to everything-else-that-isn't-dough on the pizza. \u00a0I enjoy a really hearty and thick slice of pizza when I go for deep dish, but the thickness of the bottom dough/crust was getting to me after the second slice. \u00a0I couldn't even finish the third slice, which is frankly an embarrassment for a man of my rotund stature. \u00a0All that remained of the third slice was a mound of crust and dough with the flesh and sauce stripped off and consumed.Yet another round of deep-dish-pizza hilarity that would not allow room for a dessert.But before I leave you with the score, I have to mention the \"unique\" atmosphere of this place.Pequod's Pizzeria is, in my opinion, an Inside Joke. \u00a0The kind where somebody at the table says something that makes no sense to you, but everyone around you is snickering or cracking up and tells you that \"you just had to be here\" or \"it's a Jersey thing\" or some other excuse as to why you won't understand the joke. \u00a0That's how it felt here. \u00a0And at the center of it all is a mascot whale with a pair of panties on its head, just staring you in the face and DARING you to \"get the joke\". \u00a0And I didn't. \u00a0The metaphor extended to the waitstaff, who seemed to be enjoying conversations with each other more than with the patrons of the establishment. \u00a0I would NOT \u00a0say that we had bad service. \u00a0Not at all. \u00a0But after refilling our soda, our server would hang out at the bar with the bartender or the register with some other staff, making comments to each other and yukking it up in general.(There's also a mysterious second floor, which I believe it just extra seating. \u00a0I was intrigued, but grateful to be on the first floor and not having to entertain the thought of navigating steps with a tummy full of doughy, cheesy 'zza.)Near the end of the meal, I just had to try and get an explanation. \u00a0I pulled our server over and just flat-out asked, \"So why is the mascot a whale with a pair of panties on its head?\"\"I don't really know - I think it was created by the owner or something. \u00a0But it's pretty cool, I think.\"Well, maybe the Inside Joke is just the simple fact that you're not able to know why the punchline is funny. \u00a0I agree it's kind of a humorous idea of putting panties on the head of a whale, but they would either have to be unthinkably-large panties or an unthinkably-small whale. \u00a0I still don't get it...But what I do get is that it's no joke that Food Network magazine made the right choice, because Pequod's Pizzaria hand-down beat out both Lou Malnati's and Pizzeria Uno in our deep-dish pizza competition.", "Date": "2011-10-22", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Joseph H.", "ReviewID": "ql0kdy5QbNzjOaYJdZkNUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got here on a Saturday night around 6-7 PM.

Bartenders and wait staff were super friendly and accommodating. Never took long to get new drinks and our water cups were always kept full, which is a huge plus in my book. *Note when we left around 11 this place was maybe half full, so later you come the better.Ordered the cheesy bread which was good, but nothing to write home about. Might recommend them to start serving it with some nacho cheese sauce.However the deep dish pizza here was some of the best pizza I've had in awhile, makes my top 5 list of pizza places. Ended up with a sausage and mushroom pizza and a spinach and mushroom pizza, both were great. Starting with the fresh ingredients, perfect amount of sauce and then the crust, whatever they are doing, they are doing right. Only issue was on one of the pizzas they had a lot of mushrooms all clumped together, but nothing to really complain about.Being a Blackhawks bar, really want to make it in for a game next time I visit. Could see this place getting packed and a great place to watch it with all their tv's and memorabilia. Note I'd definitely be showing up early to either get a table or a good spot at the bar.Only thing that was a little strange that you could see the bartenders routinely going on smoke breaks and the cashier was wearing a bull ring.

After reading the rave reviews on GrubHub.com, my roommate ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. Usually, when either one of us orders pizza, we try and push the leftovers on the other the next day to avoid the guilt of eating pizza two nights in a row. The next day, I feasted on my first slice of microwaved Peaquod's pizza and it tasted better than most slices from \u00a0freshly baked pies elsewhere.Peaquod's formula for Chicago Style pizza strays slightly from the standard. Traditional Chicago Style pizza has a moderately thinner pie style crust and is layered with cheese, ingredients, and sauce. Peaquod's is essentially a thick pan pizza with no visible crust - just sauce and cheese straight to the edge. Because the cheese isn't in a hollowed crust, there is slightly less than you'd find on a pizza from Giordano's or Gino's East. As much as I love tons of melted cheese, I'm not bothered by the reduction. What they take away in cheese, they give back in ingredients. Holy freaking pepperoni!Now for the famous \"carmelized cheese crust\" that is mentioned in every review. Personally, it's hardly my favorite thing about Peaquod's but it does have an interestingly good taste. It tastes like a parmesan crisp ...only slightly charred with a bit of pizza sauce on the edge. It's kind of like croutons on a salad in that it's a nice crunchy add on, but overlookable in comparison to the dish it complements.Chicago Style traditionalists may not like Peaquod's because it's not like all the others. I love Chicago Style Pizza and thick crust pan pizza. Finding a place that somehow merged the two was a godsend.

Honestly, did someone pour french fry grease ONTO the pizza? It was nauseating. Because we had no food, after pulling off the cheese and using about a half a roll of paper towels to soak up the remaining grease, I did eat a couple of the squares.

The love affair began with caramelized cheese crust and the passion is kept alive by, well, caramelized cheese crust. Because of the bond I feel with Pequod's, I felt confident enough that the pizza would wow my out of town friends and give my Chicago-based friends an alternative to deep dish. Pequod's did not disappoint. I was able to make a reservation for 15 people on a Saturday night 4 days prior to the date (just an FYI, they will charge your credit card $25 if you don't show up for your reservation), which impressed and relieved me. It was extremely hot in the restaurant - I'm guessing that 90 degree temps outside and constantly running pizza ovens aren't helping the case, but I would've appreciated a little extra AC so my white shorts didn't become translucent with sweat. Would I let a little perspiration taint this review? Not hardly. Thankfully our waitress kept the pitchers of beer coming and saved us all from dehydration.

So, to cut to the chase, our friend suggested Pequod's. He said he called and that we could get in, so I tried to calm down (i.e., pounded two beers) after I angered my fiancee by stating that her friends are idiots and that the reservations should have been left in my able hands. We get into to Pequod's and it is fucking PACKED. We can't stand up front, and I got yelled at by some sluttish whore for bumping her at the bar. Seriously, there was no where to go, and we had to wait for 40 minutes. I think this was our friend's fault, but I don't know. Why is it so crowded? Do they over-book or is it just that popular?Now we come to the reason for the 4-stars: the best pizza I think I have ever had. We got a thin crust with hamburger, and two deep dish, one with a lot of veggies and one with pepperoni, mushroom, and onion. FANTASTIC. I nearly shit in my drawers. We really only needed two pizzas.

The carameilized crust was PHENOMENAL and if they made the entire pizza dough with that taste, i would be in heaven. They need to sell the crust and make it an appitizer on its own, with some melted cheese , semi burning. YUM. So, i wont be returning for the pizza.Service: crappy.

When we first walked into the place I thought we would be waiting for hours, but they lead us upstairs and all the way to the other end of the restaurant and sat us immediately. We explained we were in a bit of a hurry and the waitress did great bringing us all our drinks quickly and getting our order in - even with it being packed! They had a great beer list (something that is very important to me) and also had a pretty great special on a shot of whiskey with a beer - can't go wrong there! The pizza is absolutely delish! All the ingredients so fresh and the best sausage I think I've ever had on a pizza. The warm gooey cheesey meaty combination made the walk in the freezing rain a distant memory and all my troubles were gone. Yes. Its that good. The sauce? Phenomenal! the crust being made partially out of caramelized cheese??? ohhhhh my goodness! My advice is not to get anything bigger then a medium because it is SO filling. We couldn't really take it with us either because we didn't want to take it around to all the bars that night - it was pretty heartbreaking. A medium would have easily fed 4 people - we had two four the for of us (mostly because one of us was a vegetarian and we didn't want to miss out on this heavenly sausage - \u00a0but still two smalls would have been more then fine!). I saw that someone wrote so not worth the wait. I know I didn't have to wait at all (thank goodness because we would have had to leave), but I would not be angry to wait an hour or two for this goodness!

I prefer traditional deep dish which is a thin crust that is high on the edges and filled with cheese, sauce and toppings (like a pie). Pequod's has way too much dough and not enough substance for my taste. It's all about personal preference so if you enjoy it then great BUT it is not deep dish pizza. If you do not agree with my analysis of what deep dish is please by all means visit Wikipedia and maybe they will help you understand better.

Hey--it's freakin' cold outside! The pizza arrived warm and still caramelized at the edges, the salad was well-chilled, and the garlic cheese bread arrived toasty.Working from most disappointing to favorite part of the meal, here goes:The garlic cheese bread was cheesy, but at two pieces, it didn't seem like much. I also could not taste any garlic at all. Out in the 'burbs, if you order garlic at most restaurants, you don't have to search for it in the food. Dunno if the city was misnamed a long time ago, but \"place of the wild garlic\" doesn't apply to most restaurants recipes downtown.The Pequod salad was very large (definitely enough for two people to share as a dinner salad). I don't usually like a lot of vegetables, but the dressing was just enough to mostly hide the flavor of the black olives from my tongue.There was plenty of pepperoni on top, and everything blended together well as far as taste.The pizza was tempting looking as it was thick, juicy, and covered with pepperoni as well. Couldn't even see the other ingredients (sausage and garlic). Now this time, Pequods did not disappoint with the garlic. It was visible, and could be tasted too. I would've preferred a little more, as the sauce is a bit sweet. Not too sweet, as some reviews state. The dough was just about the right thickness and consistency for a deep-ish dish pizza, and there was plenty of each of the ingredients. I didn't taste the caramelized edge as I was expecting...maybe it's an acquired taste, but I just didn't see it as a big plus. It added some flavor, but it was just kinda' crunchy and burnt...but then again, I like my toasted marshmallows golden, warm, and gooey, not black and flavorless. To each his own taste!

There are a lot of seats in this place but they all seemed to get full before we left on a Friday night, and I say if you have to wait on one of the benches conveniently located just outside the door the pizza you will soon enjoy will be worth your wait.The only complaint I have is that their beer list is a little short.

A bold and ballsy statement to make, I know, but there is no other place I'd turn to (except maybe Burt's Place in Morton Grove) for true, fresh, and delicious Chicago deep dish pizza.I came here last night for a work outing with nine other people, and Pequod's was extremely accommodating and attentive to our party. Our drinks were never empty and they were quick to take our order and brought the food out promptly after the excruciatingly long wait of 45 minutes for the pizza to bake.The pizza:The pizza here is always consistent and I've never experienced any flukes with their pizza. What makes this pizza so much better than Lou's, Unos, or Giordanos is their caramelized crust. Sure, it sounds weird, but trust me, it's what seals the deal with this pizza. It'll turn any non-crust eater into a believer.They offer a range of different toppings and you can build your own creations. Last night we went with one sausage, one pepperoni, and one \"supreme\" that had mushrooms, peppers, onions, sausage, pepperoni, and black olives. The supreme pizza was annihilated in a matter of minutes, which I chalked up to be due to the extremely fresh and plentiful ingredients that they pile on. I feel that it's worth mentioning that their sausage here isn't the disgusting \"sausage patty\" that lines the pizza, much like what they do at other pizza places. It's real sausage that is in silver dollar sized pieces sprinkled over the pizza.The atmosphere:Kind of loud and typical of any pizza joint. They have two floors so the restaurant is a lot bigger than it appears from the street.The service:They were attentive and fast, as I previously mentioned, but they weren't all that friendly. If anything there is room for improvement here.If you haven't been to Pequods, it's definitely worth checking out to get a taste of their unique take on the crust. Also, it's rarely ever \"packed\" and you won't face a 1-3 hour wait like many of the other pizza places in town.

I wanted some good pizza. I wanted what the locals eat, and I wanted a lot of it. This is my experience at Pequod's... it's a bit of a read, but it should give an idea of what you can expect. Hey, I don't eff around with Yelp reviews like other goons who say, \"Mm. Tasty. Go here.\" and call it a review... nuh-uh. Here's a tale, my friends...First of all, if it weren't for the big fat five star rating above this review, you'd probably think I absolutely hated Pequod's until the end of it. On a Saturday night at around 7:30 or so, I came with a party of four and made a reservation: \"Your wait will be about forty-five minutes to an hour.\" After walking back outside and seeing about twenty people sitting around, I knew that was probably a lie, but whatever. I'll wait.Forty-five minutes go by and I decide it'd be best to order my pizza before getting our table -- done and done: a large pan pizza with sausage and pepperoni. Another twenty minutes later, I go back in after noticing a party of six that got there way after us got a table. I was about to freak my shit, but then I figured they had a reservation. Still, a little while longer, there was a group of four that got to Pequod's soon after we did that got seated. At that point, I went inside and asked how much longer, and they said \"There are about four tables in front of you, so maybe about twenty minutes?\" I was so hungry at this point that I wasn't even mad ... and I get mega cranky when I'm hungry. After walking outside and telling my group that the wait would be even *longer*, they started walking away. After they got about a block away (I was still in line. No way in hell was I going to just leave after already waiting over an hour), we got buzzed in. Fucking FINALLY. I assume that the reservation people dun goofed their shit and overlooked my party, and got us a table ASAP before we left.We got sat down in the far back corner in the right of the restaurant, which worked well with me. Pequod's is a pretty tiny place, so being away from all the elbows is probably for the best. To get some food in our stomachs, we got the mozerella sticks, which were said to be a \"must buy\" from some reviewers here. I will say, I would definitely agree with that had the cheese been more melted. The breading on them is great, and the marinara dipping sauce is perfect.After about ten to fifteen minutes of MORE waiting, our pre-ordered pizza came. What a work of art. Huge pieces of sausage basically gave the equivalent of one full link per slice, and there was a generous amount of pepperoni. Pequod's doesn't skimp like some other places -- there's nothing worse than paying over $2 for an additional topping and getting only a few pieces.This may be the best pizza I've ever had... as good as the toppings and sauce were, the crust truly makes Pequod's stand out. Chewy, crispy, burnt (well, they call it caramelized)... damn, I could eat this just about any day. It's rare that I, or anybody that I talk to, can excuse such an excessive wait time no matter how awesome the food is, but this is an exception.Altogether, I probably waited about 90 minutes until I got in and ate my pizza. If I hadn't ordered my pizza beforehand, it would probably have been two full hours. In the future, I'll *have* to call ahead and make a reservation, because as unbelievably delicious as this pizza is, I have a hard time waiting over an hour at a restaurant.Pequod's doesn't exactly have what many people associate as \"deep dish\", \"Chicago-style\" pizza, but it does have an unreal pan pizza that will satisfy your tastebuds... legendary.", "Date": "2013-07-08", "Author_Location": "New Baltimore, MI"}, {"Author": "Kristin W.", "ReviewID": "Dcw-UJe_CZz1vzAmnECqZw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, where do I start.

That caramelized crust is ridiculously good and their trademark. And it is simply the *thickest* dough base I've ever come across, it's almost too thick dare I say. In the end, I'm still used to the non-Chicago, dough-sauce-cheese style. I wonder if I can get my next pan pizza like that.

Pequod's changed all that.Upon arriving we placed our names on the wait list, grabbed a menu and took a seat at one of the four benches outside of the restaurant. We decided on the large (14\") pan pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. After about 20 minutes our party was called, we were taken through the first floor of the restaurant, up the stairs and into the massive second level. Once seated we were given menus for a second time to see if we wanted to add appetizers, salads, etc. We decided on the Pequod Salad for our party of four with their homemade Italian dressing.The Pequod Salad came out a few minutes later -- Romaine lettuce with mozzarella cheese, peperoni, pepperoncini, black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, carrots, tomato and onion. Definitely a good choice. It was the perfect size for us to split. They didn't skimp on the toppings. And, the homemade Italian dressing as suggested by our server was delicious.As good as it was, you don't go to a place like Pequod's for the salad. A few minutes our pizza arrived -- 154 square inches (yes, I used an online calculator) of piping-hot pizza goodness. To save us from burning ourselves and making a mess of of the pizza, the server plated the first half of the pizza for us, using the square spatula to pick up the pizza and cut off the strings of melted cheese crawling from the pan onto our plates.Now the toppings on the pizza were, for the most part, comparable to both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's -- loads of pepperoni, thinly sliced mushrooms crisped by the oven, thick homemade tomato sauce and bubbling cheese. The difference, however, was found in the crust. At Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, the crust was too bready and even soggy because of all the sauce. But crust at Pequod's was heaven. They call it their \"famous caramelized crust\", an apt description. The crust was the perfect balance of buttery, chewy, crunchy, crispy, slightly-burned goodness. And at the edges, the cheese had melted to the side of the crust/pan to form a \"halo\" (their word, not mine) of caramelized cheesy/crusty deliciousness.In the end, that crust and that \"halo\" single-handedly saved Chicago's reputation for having a \"to-die-for deep-dish pizza.\" For that all Chicago natives should be thankful.

We ordered a thin crust pizza, and the waitress followed up with \"Do you want any cheesy garlic breadsticks?\". Caught off guard, we said \"Sure, ok,\" expecting something along the lines of a small breadbasket. We were instead served two long planks of garlic bread, bubbling with cheese, and marinara sauce. And everything was excellent-- good quality cheese, and the sauce! Perfection! So, naturally, we were excited to see what our actual pizza would be like......and this is where Pequod's really faltered. The pizza appeared to have nothing in common with our fantastic appetizer-- poorer quality dough, cheese, and appallingly bad sauce. Also, we ordered our pizza with bell peppers, which had been over-cooked-- that's become a pet peeve since that fated Indiana pizza *shudders*, and it could have been worse, but I really prefer them crisp. Again, it wasn't terrible, it just suffered from a lack of melding of the flavors, as though the sauce wasn't in tune with the cheese, which wasn't in tune with anything else. Considering they seem to know what they're doing in the \"bread + cheese + sauce\" department, as evidenced by our appetizer, it must be just sheer perversity that leads them to make such poor quality pizza.

The atmosphere--this place has a real pizzeria feel, right down to the brick walls, the wooden booths, the TVs in every corner, and the little waitresses yelling out to the bartender \"TWO DIETS\" in a tubular Chicago accent whenever we asked for a refill on our pops.2. The people--this place is NOT pretentious. You won't find any yuppies or business suits here. The crowd is friendly, laid-back, and comfortable in their jeans and tee shirts. Another plus is that it's a little bit off-track from the typical tourist-destination Chicago pizza joints, so I don't see that many touristy family excursions here too often.3. The pizza--It's better than Giordano's, but then again, most pizzerias are. (Oh yeah, I just went there. ) The pan pies are fantastic. The dough actually has flavor, and then of course, there's that carmelized cheese. It may not be the best pizza you've ever encountered in your life (or maybe it is!), but it damn sure will come close. One downside to Pequod's--no free refills! I know, I know. What is this, like, 1876? Who doesn't give free refills nowadays? The first time that happened to me at Pequod's, I wound up ringing up a tab of $16 just on diet pepsi refills alone!

I'm a HUGE fan of Giordano's and this pizza was different from theirs, but different doesn't mean bad. Basically, there was less cheese, more sauce. A good amount of spinach, although I feel there could have been more, but I don't know that most people love spinach as much as I do. The most interesting thing about the pizza is the carmelized crust, which makes the crust worth eating if you're not normally a fan of the crust. My friend was figuring that he could finish off the small pizza, but that didn't happen. It's definitely more filling than it appears to be. We could have shared one pizza and finished it (if only we could have agreed on a vegetarian one!) but instead, we both ended up taking home leftovers. I had my leftovers two days later and it was almost as yummy as the night we had the pizza in the restaurant.

Unfortunately I haven't been able to answer it with enthusiasm. I've tried the places that people rant and rave about; Gino's East, Giordano's, Pizano's, Pieces and a few others. While none of them were disappointing, they didn't live up to the expectations of Chicago pizza. I thought maybe that the great Chicago deep dish was a myth, something we New Yorkers had made up. Then I found Pequod's Pizzeria. Now that's some Chicago deep dish pizza!Pequod's has a very unassuming location on the 2200 block of North Clybourn. The seating area appears clean and tidy, but reminds you more of a bar than it would a pizzeria. The staff there is friendly and courteous, greeting and seating us the minute we stepped in. They even offered us better seating in the rear to get away from the cold air coming in as patrons entered and exited the restaurant. They serve both deep dish and thin crust pizzas in small, medium and large sizes (10\", 12\", 16\") along with an array of appetizers. They offer an assortment of toppings but this being my first adventure I decided to stick with the tried and true topping of pepperoni. While we waited, a couple next to us was putting a hurting on a medium pizza that looked really good. They overheard us talking and piped in with \"This is going to be the best pizza you've had in the city\". High praise but I had heard it all before.The pizza came out and it looked absolutely delectable. The first thing I noticed is that the edge of the pizza appeared to be darkened, almost like it had been burned. The waitress assured me that it was perfectly normal due to their famous \"caramelized crust\". I dove in and it was heaven. For those of you who like Gino's East, this is basically Gino's pizza with a helping of perfection added in. It has a very similar cornmeal like crust to the pizza, but it doesn't seem to taste as strong, which is a good thing. The pizza is very saucy, like Gino's, but not to the point where it's incredibly messy. The pepperoni was cooked exactly how i like it, where it's a bit crispy, but not burned. The portions were a good size as well. A small pizza split between two people should be enough for most, although if you want leftovers you may want to go with a medium.All that being said, Pequod's has been the best pizza experience I've had since moving to Chicago. Now when friends and family come to visit, I know exactly where to take them. If you're in the neighborhood I would suggest stopping in.

With it's extremely flavorful and high quality ingredients (the sauce and toppings were fantastic), and lighter, less cheese-dominated pizza, Pequod's is definitely among the best deep-dish/pan pizza's I've every had.We ordered our pizza to-go, so I can't speak for the restaurant experience Pequod's offers, but the food was delicious. We ordered both the thin crust (which was more like a regular pie than typical crispy thin crust), as well as the standard pan pizza. While both were good, the pan/deep-dish pie is what really impressed me. I don't exactly recall the toppings we ordered for the thin crust (the pan pizza was THAT good), but we ordered the pan pie with spinach, onion, basil, and garlic, which ended up being an excellent combination.Unlike some of the Chicago deep-dish staples (Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, etc.), Pequod's pan pizza was fairly light on the cheese, which I felt allowed me to better appreciate the other components of the pizza (sauce, toppings, etc.). This also meant I was able to eat more, as the pizza was more bready and not nearly as heavy as that of some of Pequod's competitors.The ingredients seemed very fresh and flavorful, and the caramelized crust was a pleasant change from traditional deep dish as it was enjoyable on its own and also pretty light.The only downside about this place was the price of the pizza. After including the toppings, a medium thin crust and a large pan totaled to about $40. At the end of the day, though, the pizza was probably satisfying enough to justify the extra cost, and ended up being more than enough for four people.I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a slightly unique take on Chicago's deep-dish, and especially those looking for a lighter pizza that isn't as cheese-heavy as some of the other traditional deep-dish establishments.", "Date": "2009-08-24", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "John H.", "ReviewID": "KOWPrqKgxTQqsOPqnpF0PQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is simply the best pizza anywhere.Their pan pizza really defies classification--to call it \"Chicago Style\" pizza does it a disservice: \u00a0It is no three-inch thick slab of overwhelming cheesyness topped with an anemic tomato paste. \u00a0No. \u00a0It is a superb bread to cheese to sauce ratio. \u00a0And there has been though put into how everything tastes. \u00a0The bread compliments the cheese taste which compliments the well-spiced sauce. \u00a0Many people have mentioned the caramelized crust, and it's just about perfect.I'm honestly less enamored with the thin crust pizza, but I'm not sure why anyone would come to Pequod's and get the thin crust pizza... \u00a0I feel the same way about the appetizers, but, again, if you're ruining your appetite for pizza on the appetizers that's, like, your choice, man.There is a pretty decent beer selection, and the service is fine. \u00a0Pequod's is very busy on weekend nights, so expect to wait a little while if you don't have a reservation.", "Date": "2009-10-18", "Author_Location": "Danville, IL"}, {"Author": "Jay M.", "ReviewID": "h-kAZ4xgYTU4GC8WNWM88g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fav Street Reporter back again.

When it's bad, you need the extra flavor.I don't recommend the thin-crust, as the crust is not caramelized and doesn't have much flavor. The pan at least always has a charred crust, and on good days it's caramelized.I appreciate the local-leaning draft beer selection, although I wish they varied their Half Acre option more frequently, as it's usually the heavier Over Ale.

I have tried many different deep dish places during my stay in Chicago and have to admit that Pequod's is unique.We got a deep dish with peppers and pineapples (goes against the cardinal rule of getting sausage or pepperoni with pizza, but I hadn't seen pineapple offered in deep dish before). It was very pleasant, but not typical deep dish pizza.It was much lighter than most pizzas. There wasn't that much cheese, in all honesty. The crust made up a lions share of the pizza. The cheese was not much more than you would get at a typical carry out pizza place (like Papa Johns) and the toppings were clearly added as an afterthought rather than being cooked in (maybe the pineapple wouldn't have done well to be baked for so long, but I was kind of disappointed). The caramelized crust had a slightly unique taste, but it was an aftertaste rather than an overpowering flavor (honestly, not worth going just for the crust).Maybe I got an off day, but I wasn't overly impressed. It was pleasant and I felt much better than I normally do after eating deep dish, but this is because they seem to skimp on cheese. If you are dieting or don't want to feel bloated, this could be a good deep dish place for you.The service was fine and the place was clean. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.

The overflowing cheese emerges from the oven as a halo of caramelized crust.\" \u00a0- PequodsOkay, Pequods, your prose is worthy of your namesake Melville. In fact, \"a halo of caramelized crust\" is almost poetic. But tell me this: WHY IS THE WHALE WEARING A THONG ON HIS HEAD? The possibly obscene answer to this riddle went unexplained, none of the waitstaff knew the reason.When you walk in, you see the neon sign with the whale and this pink thing, figure it must be the whale is eating a slice of pizza. Then on the poster inside, looks kind of different... is this some species of whale with unusual natural markings on its head? No, turns out that it's a thong. There must still be someone around from the good old days who knows the origin of the story. This place is classic Chicago, has been in business since 1970. Actually it's partly a sports bar, with TV's showing all of the local sports games, especially the Blackhawks. Beers on tap included Sam Adams, Goose Island, Half Acre, and Stella Artois. Served cold, cold, cold, in chilled glasses. They have big neon signs of all of the major breweries, as well as lots of signs and paraphernalia for the sports teams. And there are some classic movie posters - Cary Grant, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, etc. Some of the other posters look like enlargements of family photos from the 1970's.There are two levels, the layout is kind of narrow but the second floor adds a lot of space. It's more quiet up there when the ground floor gets bustling, and it has its own bar. Open late. The menu is simple, the whole thing fits on one side of a laminated card. They have pastas, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers in addition to the pizza. Not cheap but not expensive, either. There are wooden chopping blocks / serving boards on the tables which are cut in the shape of whales. They really do have their own style of pizza going on at Pequod's, it's not quite like any other Chicago deep-dish. Personally I thought the \"caramelized halo\" was good, they intentionally let the cheese get slightly burned around the edge of the top. The rest of the crust is thick and fluffy. The sauce is rather plain, doesn't have much taste of its own, so recommend adding some ingredients. Fun and unpretentious place with what most people will agree is good pizza. The style may not be to everyone's liking, you would have to try it to find out, since it's fairly unique.

I'm more of a fan of the thin crust pizzas here, although the \"carmelized\" cheese (aka burnt) on the deep-dish is interesting. That said, my two most recent orders were for a simple thin-crust sausage pizza. I used to be obsessed with the sausage they used because it was big hunks of REAL fennel-loaded Italian sausage, rather than those little round pellets of kibble that pass for sausage at the bulk of pizza places. But my last two pizzas just don't taste the same as the pizza I once loved. I thought my last order in which the sausage and spices on the pizza tasted a little off was a fluke, so I gave it another try. I'm not sure if they've switched sausage or altered the spices in the sauce or what, but it just isn't as good as it used to be. Also, I opened the box to find the cheese so runny that half of the ingredients of the pizza had slid to one side, which is annoying to say the least.I figure I've been a good enough customer and they've been reliable in the past so I plan to give them one more shot, although I'll stay away from the sausage. If my next pizza has the same iffy flavor as my past two, I'm thinking a decrease in stars might be in order.Caveat: When you order over the phone and pay with a credit card, they tend to write your entire card number, security code and ZIP code on the yellow carbon receipt stapled to the bag or box, so you might want to be sure to shred that baby before you throw it out.", "Date": "2007-10-26", "Author_Location": "Bloomington, IN"}, {"Author": "C M.", "ReviewID": "DTmcWTSmIoCoBW77blhklg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Take out only!Highly acclaimed by Rachel as the best Deep Dish Pizza in all of Chicago-land, I opted to grab some take out from Pequod's to sample their offerings.Extra-Large Deep Dish Pizza w/ Sausage & Onions...Perhaps the monstrosity of the Pizza is the first most notable feature of Pequod's offerings. \u00a0At first glance, the size of the pizza resembled that of a car tire, rather than \"Pizza\". \u00a0The weight alone is enough to scare away any willing participant. \u00a0Of course, sampling the offerings should be the most judged critique in the Pizza's execution. \u00a0At first consumption, the gluttonous amount of ingredients used in the application is the most noteworthy attribute to Pequod's rendition of Deep Dish Pizza. \u00a0The slightly burnt, crispy crust is the first detection during consumption; which acts as the foundation of the monstrosity. \u00a0The mild detection of mozzarella cheese is the second of many flavors available. \u00a0Although the slew of contrasting elements in both flavor and quantity is the emphasis of Pequod's creation, the taste is ultimately the binding principle. \u00a0Patrons consuming this pizza will find that the gluttonous exertion of flavors produced from all elements ranging from the starchiness of the dough, the robust and tart nature of the tomato sauce, and meatiness / mild saltiness from the sausage work in stark contrast and conjunction to create a superb edible. \u00a0The excessive amount of all the ingredients used works remarkable well in the creation of both a burdensome but welcoming edible.What Pequod's embodies with their rendition of a Chicago staple is a perfect example of the city's food offerings. \u00a0It is through Pequod's embodiment of the mentality of Big Food / Big Flavor approach, that the foundation of their Pizza is created. \u00a0With most food, large quantities do not equate to excessive flavors. \u00a0Luckily, Pequod's manages to find a balance between both, while supplying an excessive amount of consumables within it's Deep Dish Pizza.", "Date": "2009-06-24", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "John W.", "ReviewID": "-xj_8yEOPUXYt_jFyMPakA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of my favorite pizzas, but you must eat it there.", "Date": "2013-04-07", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Dan G.", "ReviewID": "Y4WXCvtMziKe-WCEfIrvVg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Creme Fraiche!

Based on a little Yelping research I knew deep dish was the thing to get here. Great taps of seasonal brews from Half Acre, Sam Adams and New Belgium. We put together an order while we got started on pitcher one of NB's 2 Below. Spinach, mushroom, garlic, extra sauce and light cheese for the lady. Sausage, pepperoni, garlic and extra sauce for the gents. It would look kind of odd if Kris and I both got our own pies, so I'm glad my buddy solved that problem for us. About the time we moved onto our second pitcher, the dude showed up struggling to hold our pizzas. Right here dude! These things clunked down on the table like they were Grandma's old cast iron skillet. They smelled fantastic for starters, that would be the garlic. We wasted no time tackling these pies. It's a little thick for my taste (that's what she said) which is why you'll want to go with extra sauce. The sauce is tangy and a bit spicy, but not sweet at all. I liked the charred cheese around the rim of the crust. That's a nice touch that added another level of flavor. The garlic and pepperoni kicked in with some spiciness and the big chunks of fenneled sausage were tasty. Pretty damn good. I liked this one better than the veggie, but they were both great. Our beer and za gluttony hit Thanksgiving levels as we caught up and the brew flowed on to the third pitcher. Things were not expensive at all. I think our pies were $25 even with all the toppings and the pitchers were about $17. That's a steal that we'll surely take advantage of again. I also liked that they had all the accompaniments of red pepper, grated cheese and herbs on the table already. I had an excellent afternoon buzz by the time we left and had such a great time that I halted the cab dead in it's tracks when I realized I had forgotten our leftovers at Pequod's. I think I was about halfway down the block in pouring rain when I heard Kris ask if I was really going back to get them. Is this man serious about pizza?

Sure, I've come across others during my time here, but nothing compares (cue Sinead O'Connor's bald head here). Sure, the atmosphere is very Chicago sports bar-y, but you'll forget all about that when that tomatoey, cheesy, and whatever other toppings-y slice hits your taste buds. I don't know how they do it, but the caramelized crust is perfectly cheesy, crunchy, but chewy at the same time. I could seriously eat an entire pizza, of just caramelized crust. I don't know what that would look like, but I don't care, I want it in my belly. As for the rest of the pizza, they don't hold back on the toppings, and you'll eat until you're painfully full, but still want to eat more. It's just that good. The pizza, beer, and service is great, and even though this is such a popular pizza spot, they've maintained a hometown, local feel, which I love. So play roulette with the topping choices, they're all pretty dang delicious.

And Pequod's was the latest foray into that elusive hunt.There is a thin line between caramelization and burnt. Sometimes 30 seconds is all it takes to pass from heavenly and delicious to hellish and inedible. Every deep dish pizza Pequod's has ever made has been subject to this dangerous game of good vs. evil. Sometimes, good wins, and you have a transcendental pizza experience, complete with angels singing and strumming their harps. Other times, you want to go and smash the cook in the face with the cast iron pan they kept in the oven 30 seconds too long and burned the cheese on the crust like a Russian general scorching the earth as they retreated from Napoleon. It seems like people are trying a little too hard to make this the de-facto Chicago local deep dish pizza, but just because a restaurant has 2 locations vs 14, or doesn't have online ordering yet, or doesn't take reservations on weekend nights doesn't make it the yardstick for authentic Chicago deep dish. Hanging a Blackhawks banner, televising Bears games, or having slightly better than the swill most pizza places have on tap doesn't really have anything to do with the pizza, and honestly, I was expecting so much more from the pizza than what Pequod's delivered.It's not a true deep dish, but rather more like a Sicilian with the cheese below the sauce. Instead of a copious amount of cheese and sauce, you get a yeasty dough that is about an inch tall. This flies in the face of true deep dish. The dough is definitely not where you want the majority of your height in a deep dish pizza. You rely on the cheese and toppings/sauce layer to make up the majority of the height in cross-section view. \u00a0Overall - Was it good? Yes. It's pizza. It's kind of hard to ruin pizza, unless of course you burn it. Which inevitable will happen if you eat at Pequod's enough times. It's not a matter of \"if.\" It is a matter of \"when.\"Therefore, enjoy it, knowing that each time you go, you play Russian roulette with the burnt crust, and the next time might be the time you are forced to update your review with a 1-star for ruining your crust.", "Date": "2012-10-23", "Author_Location": "Camarillo, CA"}, {"Author": "Denny M.", "ReviewID": "jxmnI2q2jjVQeA8NwndA-g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Burnt cheese ... ton's of toppings.Very, very, very good pizza.", "Date": "2007-08-31", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "A M.", "ReviewID": "0f6RXIg9JkJeYcIVqWdisw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 9 friends.

We were bumming about our lack of softball prowess, and pizza heals all wounds. Pequod's has a sports bar atmosphere, a natural fit in a sporty town like Chicago, but its clear that on \"game night\" this place is going to be packed. Its a relatively small bar/restaurant, with short little booths made for two, and barstool flanked tables surrounded by Chicago sports memorabilia and flat-screen TVs. We kept it simple: soda, salad, sausage-spinach-mushroom deep dish pie. Our server brought our drinks and salads quickly; service here is brisk and friendly. The house salad was simple - chopped lettuce, sliced black olives, a slice of tomato, shredded carrots, all dressings on the side. Comforting in its simplicity. Our pizza took another 20-25 minutes, pretty standard for a deep dish place. I was hesitant about getting deep dish because I can't stand the typical heavy, buttery, pastry-dough crusts that so many Chicago-style places employ. When it came out, I saw that the cheese had oozed out onto the sides of the well-seasoned cast iron skillet, and I was briefly debating how greasy everything was going to be. But yessss...I was extremely pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the crust on Pequod's pizza! How Pequod's can take a thick layer of tangy, crunchy-on-the-bottom but light-on-the-inside crust, smother it with cheese, bright tomato sauce, and fresh spinach, herby golfball sized chunks of sausage, and fresh mushrooms and have it NOT be a belly bomb is kind of a pizza miracle. I ate two slices of medium-sized pie and felt full without that greaseball quesiness I get from just one slice of \"the other guys\" stuff.

They're $2 for each damn topping! $2 for onion?? Seriously - I should omit 2 stars for that sort of tom foolery but the crust is so good that I can't. I love this pizza.

We decided to go with spinach and garlic to compare it to Giordano's, whose spinach and garlic pizza is out of this world. This pizza was also excellent.

My deep dish did not have much cheese either, considering most competitor pizzas put up to 2\" of cheese in a deep dish. Finally, my biggest complaint about Pequods is the crust! I know alot of people rave about it but I thought it was gross. This is not pizza crust, it is like a spongy cake! To me, pizza crust should be buttery and crunchy, not cake-like and bland.
