Taste like the roast duck that hangs near the windows in Cantonese restaurants. Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo - One of their most popular sauces. Sweet and come on, its mango flavored. How can you go against that.Dill Lemon Mayo - Had an herby mild flavor with a hint of lemon zest. Didn't really like it.Bordeaux Wine, Figs, and Sage Mayo - I am a sucker for the crazy sauces.

This is definitely a must have when trying these exotic flavors.Parmesan Peppercorn- I was not feeling this one. It tasted too milky and cheesy so I just avoided this one.Pomegranate Teriyaki- Another flavor liked by Yelp but not feeling this one.

How can a place serve nothing but french frie or pommes frites? Well when you only serve one item except sauces, the attention to detail and focus only increases. While these fries may not be perfect \u00a0I'd say they're pretty damn good. Personally I prefer shoestring fries however you really need something with little meat in order to dip in the sauces Oh and the sauces. where to start first of all this is close to half of what makes this place shine because frankly I don;t think they would have made it on french fries alone. Anyway obviously \u00a0you've ordered some fries now for the dipping sauces. while several standard typical sauces like ketchup and mustard are offered for free I highly recommend the 3 for 3.75 deal. Not only is there a plethora of sauces to choose from but this way several can be sampled at once. From those I have tried myself not only has Pommes Frites come up with a large variety of sauces to choose from but the quality \u00a0is good as well. Form my experience I would highly recommend the truffle mayo or roast garlic mayo. They will also offer samples which is great before you order.Although the fries are crisp and the sauce accompanies them nicely I wish there was more to the establishment. It is a very quick, in and out process, order fries, choose sauce, pick up order, and go. While there are \u00a0few table near the back tit usually limited.

This, my friends, is the mecca of all past-midnight grubberies.The moment you manage to get off the streets and get into the building, you could feel the air of oil sliming against your body.

There are usually three or four dudes cooking the fries and getting the sauces ready, so even if the line seems long, it usually goes by quickly. They are usually nice enough to let you taste test some of their sauces, which they have a TON of. I really hope you like mayo, because if you don't your choices become pretty limited.I've tried the wild mushroom mayo (eh... kind of bland), pesto mayo (really good! I love pesto), the sun dried tomato mayo (MMmmm), the peanut satay (um, kinda weird and chunky), and the mango chutney (I like the sweetness and it's a nice variety from the thicker mayos). I've also tried the especial sauce (onions, ketchup, mayo, and all very good!) and the poutine (huuuuuge fan!). The Poutine was good but a little on the small side.

Unfortunately for me, I hate eating oily and greasy stuff in the streets, so I stay away from Pommes Frites often. But today, a table opened up and it instantly made my experience better. While the tables were dirty and oily from the prior customers, it was still better than holding a cone of fries on one hand, balancing the sauces on the other, and having no third arm to eat with. The portion is pretty gigantic. I believe my friend ordered a regular and it fed three of us no problem. We couldn't even finish it. I believe I'll be coming back to try the Mango Chutney sauce everyone is raving about. Also I recently discovered Poutine and wanted to try it and they have it here, so that's a plus.

Walking into the narrow, narrow store, the very elegant and refined smell of fried stuff punched me in the nose. I watched a man deftly dump a basketful of thickly cut potato spears into the bubbling oil. They slowly turned gold, floating to the top. I had eaten sushi a few moments ago, but I've always had an extra stomach for fried potato. A friend naively decided to treat the three of us to a large sized fries (bless his little heart), along with an Irish Curry dipping sauce. The sauce cost us 5 buckaroos, but trust me, the small little container goes a long way, even with the large size. We were presented with an oily cone of fries. Upon reaching the seats, we realized that all the tables were decked out with a circle cut out every few inches or so. Clever, clever, Pommes Frites. I like your style. The first bite was full of awesome. The thing about french fries is that, as delicious as they are, they're not exactly the breakthrough of the century. That said, with a large size, it got a bit monotonous, had it not been for the various flavors of sauces that were offered. We had chosen Irish Curry. Now, what makes it Irish ? Well, who knows ! But it tasted like curry, in gravy form. The combination reminded me of really good Japanese curry, actually. The only thing I have to point out is that, Pommes Frites tend to cut their french fries up super thick. You have the occasional super crunchy one, but a bunch of them are a bit too soft for my liking. As we slowly grazed through our french fries, they wilted quite a bit.PROS: Pommes Frites? French fries, delicious. Served with a rainbow of flavors. Wilted french fries serve as excellent weapons against enemies. CONS: $5 for a measly container of sauce ? C'mon, guys.

Forget the calories, it's all right to indulge in some guilty pleasures once in awhile. For one, Poutine may be one of them. Until only recently did I discover the Poutine at Pommes Frites, and damn, that is one unhealthy, but freaking delicious 'snack'. Pommes Fries is the Manhattan institution of Belgian style fries, perfectly double cooked Belgian style fries, which can be accompanied by several different flavored dips. You can order them regular, large, or double ranging from about $5 - $8, relatively inexpensive I'd say. Get the combo sauce deal for $4 to try 3 sauces (or $1.50 per dip). They have your basic condiments plus a variety of mayo based flavored dips. You're going to want to try more than one dip though, and you'll want to try something more than just ordinary ketchup. First time, I tried the smoked eggplant, horseradish, and dill lemon mayo. No surprise, horseradish was my favorite. Midway torwards the end though, you may not be able to differentiate between the dips because, trust me, you'll be nomming away on those fries. French fry grease all over fingers and mouth and such. The fries alone aren't too salty, if at all. You can really taste the quality of their potatoes, and it's not just grease and salt. Their potatoes are not the type you just buy from Shop Rite either. Going back on POUTINE (and I capitalize it because I must emphasize it), let me emphasize that it's super unhealthy, but it's one of those unhealthy pleasures that you must indulge in, at least once in your life, or at least the first or second time you're at Pommes. Especially for someone who's never had Poutine in their life, prepare to have your mind blown. I never had it before, and the first time I had it at Pommes, I understood why everyone loves Pommes. Yes, it's that good. Cheesy cheese curd melted atop warm gravy, warm gravy and cheesy cheese curd melted atop Belgian style fries. Yes, there is a french fry Heaven on Earth, and Pommes is it. Nothing to be surprised about, but it's always busy up in this place. I've been lucky enough to get a seat the past few times because most customers will give up waiting for one the moment they walk in. Pommes is a very very tiny place, and it's certainly not about ambiance. I'm not really surprised why Pommes keeps their shop so small though, and I think it's a pretty smart business move on their part. A true hole in the wall joint, and if you're okay with the shabby appearance and lack of seating (but at least they got music in the background), then call this the perfect place to eat at any time of the day, but for myself, it's perfect for a late night snack (sober or not).", "Date": "2013-08-04", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Phil H.", "ReviewID": "d8cy0VEamjALYycq5DI56Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really hate myself at times like this.

Why am I force feeding my face in a frenzy of delicious sauce covered fries with no end in sight? Why are my arteries screaming bloody murder? \"No mas! No mas!\" they scream, but I am deaf to their cries. All I want to do is sit here in carbohydrate bliss and eat my Pommes Frites. \u00a0 FUC YEAH! Delicious hot Belgian frites and a gazillion tasty sauces to dip into! Calories be damned! This is FAT-ASTICAL!!!Whether they are authentic Belgian fries or not it doesn't matter to me. All I know is that after trying a few free samples that the cool dudes behind the counter were happy to oblige me with I was hooked. I needed to have some, nay, it was imperative that I have these at this utmost moment. Yes, I also had been out for a few drinks, but that is neither here nor there. At this point in time I needed those potatoes in me.IN MAH BELLY!!!The place itself is small and a bit grimy looking with only a few tables in the back and a small counter space against the wall. I perched myself in a private little spot on the counter and ripped open my bag of delight while hovering over it as if to protect and attack anyone trying to get near it. It was like I was Gollum greedily snatching up his \"precious\". Now, I just ordered a regular size and it could still feed a baby elephant. Thick and hot frites freshly made. Along with two sauces I added to it - sweet mango chutney mayo and smoked eggplant mayo - \u00a0I knew I was instantly hooked and now will have to avoid this part of 2nd Avenue for the rest of eternity. Delicious deep fried potatoes dipped into those sauces were heavenly. I felt so dirty and ashamed after eating all of this. For less than ten dollars I will never be able to look at a potato the same way ever again. It will take years of therapy to wash the stench of frites from my soul, and purge the taste of those sauces from my being.Oh well, as I quote Billy Joel - \u00a0\"I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.

As to be expected, the line was out the door and partially down the sidewalk-- usually a good sign, but never when hungry. The menu was a tiny sign scribbled in chalk on a slab of wood beneath the awning of this tiny curbside shack; two columns of condiments with which to embellish one's fries: mayos, cheeses, ketchups, curries and other exotic sauces. Thankfully, I came for one thing and one thing only-- the infamous Poutine-- which made life easy. I placed my order, then shuffled along beside the counter, watching intently as the dude constructed my Poutine: gravy and curds, fries, more gravy and curds and fries and finally, gravy and curds. There are few things I appreciate more than fillings and toppings, but to have them layered into a dish for me is perhaps the most thoughtful thing ever. Because I hate fiddling around to stir a container of something filled to the brim and losing bits of it in the process.It was everything I imagined it would be: crispy, thick-cut and double-fried, generously salted potatoes doused in brown gravy and studded with sweet melted cheese curds. My first mouthful resulted in instant regret at having only ordered a small. I felt little shame in slurping strings of cheese and wiping gravy from my chin as I crossed over busy streets and wove in and out of crowds.My friend, who's had the Poutine a dozen times already, chose the Rosemary Garlic fries this time, and of course, I had to sample them.

He also asked us if we wanted any free samples of the sauces. {Pommes Frites} Perfectly crisp. Seasoned well. A generous serving. If you're looking for a small snack, a regular (their smallest size) is plenty for 2 people to share. {Sauces} I was able to try 5 different sauces: Parmesan Peppercorn, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sweet Mango Chutney, Pomegranate Teriyaki Mayo, and Curry Ketchup. The Roasted Garlic and Curry Ketchup were our favorites. Our least favorites were the Sweet Mango Chutney and the Pomegranate Teriyaki. The Roasted Garlic and Curry Ketchup had a bolder flavor than the other sauces. The Sweet Mango Chutney had a very light mango flavor and none of us could taste the Pomegranate in the Pomegranate Teriyaki sauce. We could primarily taste mayo in both sauces. {Pricing}Regular $4.50, Large $6.25, Double $7.75Any 3 sauces $2.50 {Notes} When ordering, keep in mind that they give you a generous serving of sauce.

I understand why they offer so many different sauces and how they can justify charging that amount for an amount that you can plow through quite quickly even with that portion - the fries solo certainly wouldn't have me itching to come back despite being freshly fried on demand, since $4.50 of spuds can getcha more elsewhere (even of this mushy, greasy, infinitely devourable variety that they execute well).

Add to that list - every (normal) person loves french fries! from babies to mothers to grandmothers, french fries are the universal symbol for 'fried, starchy goodness'. Pommes Frites is a haven for pomme frite lovers the world over - and is an example of specialization at its best. Whoever started this place is a genius! All they need to do is chop up the potatoes (probably automated), and dump them in the fryer (easy-peasy)! The sauces are the icing on the cake (pun intended) and are likely the most labor intensive part of the whole operation. But it seems like all of their sauces can be refrigerated, and thus can be prepared in bulk quantities in advance. They must be RAKING in the dough (hehe) - at 5-7$ per serving, and probably 30-45 second turnover per order, that's pretty awesome! And with a no-frills setting (cute little wooden tables with holes in them for the cone!!!), their overhead must be pretty low.The fries themselves are the perfect steak fries - thick, substantial and double-fried to ensure a soft inside and crispy outside. This is an art, people.And yes, we can all complain and moan that 7$ is too much for fries, but that one cone has enough carbs and fat in it to fuel Lance Armstrong through half the Tour de France. And y'all still go there, so stop whining!Anyways - 5 stars. The only thing I'd like to do is go at a less crowded time and actually try some of their more unusual sauces - the few that I tried have all been interesting so far!

Between 4 people, we got the large with roasted garlic mayo, sweet mango chutney mayo, and vietnamese pineapple mayo. I was a little hesitant in eating the TWICE-FRIED potatoes, but it was surprisingly good. You get your sauces right away while you wait for your fries to come out. If you get their little take home menu, you will notice the 25 different flavors you can order from. The guy said the first 5 are their most popular flavors. Out of all the flavors we got, the favorite was the sweet mango chutney mayo. If you taste them right off the bat without the fries, they taste great. With the fries though, the sweet mango chutney was the best. It was sweet which went hand in hand with the salty fries. It was a great balance. You probably don't even need to drink anything while you're there.They also have this spicy green sauce which they mix with ketchup and horseradish. He let me have a small sampling but he warned me that it was really spicy. It kind of looked like a thick salsa verde but packed with a bunch of flavor that can numb your mouth if you can't take the spicyness. Definitely eat it with the ketchup to keep the spice level down.There are two tables in the back and holes to put in your dipping sauces. Along the side is a very narrow bar with bar stools. Not very convenient as the entrance of the back of the store is right there. Take in the experience and watch them prepare the fries.

Or rather two cravings with one trip.I'd been told that a order of fries in the smallest size was enough to feed 2 people. I never believed it until I saw with my own eyes. Those cones of fries are huge! Being the pig I am, I could probably get myself to finish one. But I probably wouldn't live to Yelp again after inhaling that last yummy, greasy potato stick. Especially with the addition of the finger licking mayo concoctions. They're a dollar each and if I had my way I'd be getting one of each with a large cone of fries.It was oddly empty in the tiny place at a quarter to 1. There was one guy sitting in the back with his cone propped up in the holes strategically cut through the tables. I walked in and asked the guy behind the counter what he suggested for a sauce. He gave me his top five and then gave me a sample squirt with some hot fries. Yum! It was a hard decision but I finally decided on the Rosemary Garlic Mayo with a Small Cone.While making my fries the guy did the most amazing thing that I completely did not expect. He asked where I was from. Wait.. is that small talk I sense? \"Why I'm from Brooklyn. And yourself?\" Well I must say that's the kind of hospitality I would never expect from any New Yorker. And that's coming from a red blooded New Yorker. It was refreshing and you know what? It even made me decide to drop a tip in his little tip can.

I've been wanting to try Pomme Frites for a while now, and last week after a few drinks at The Belfry, was the perfect opportunity. Pomme Frites is located in a tiny space in the East Village, making their customers happy with to-go brown bags filled with Belgian fries and their specialty 'Tasty Sauces'. Kyle and I got lucky and snagged an open table in the back, in which our fries were served in a white paper cone (100% recyclable and imported from Europe, of course...), placed in a hole in the table, designed specifically for presentation and easy access. Thick-cut, Belgian fries, deep fried to a beautiful golden brown, sprinkled out of the fryer with sea salt. The fries are delicious and the portions are generous. What makes Pomme Frites stand out is their many options of house-made dipping sauces, in which the fry is the perfect vehicle for dunking. They offer 26 sauces, from twists on classics (ketchup and mayo based) to creative and exotic varieties that you would never else think to pair with your french fry. Their sauces range from a simple roasted garlic mayo (so good), to hot cheddar cheese, peanut satay, honey mustard, wild mushroom mayo, and curry ketchup. Some of their more creative sauces include: pomegranate teriyaki, smoked eggplant, and black truffle mayo. Kyle and I kept it simple and classic for our first Pomme Frites experience. We shared the large cone, and got the trio of sauces: Curry Ketchup (Kyle's pick), Roasted Garlic Mayo (My pick) and Hot Cheddar Cheese (mutual decision). Plain ketchup is complimentary, along with mustard, tabasco, malt vinegar, raw onion and jalapeno if you are craving any of those.

After a little googling, I made Pommes Frites my first stop. \u00a0Took a picture, posted it on Flickr with title \"Good poutine in NYC?\" and thousands of views and years later, here I am. A Quebec transplant with roughly 40 poutine reviews across the continent, writing a review of his first US poutine. At its best, it's a stunning mix of salty, fat and hotness that is to French-Canadians what the hamburger is to Americans. It's what Canadians have labelled has their #10 best invention, ahead of the snowmobile and the Blackberry (yes I'm serious). That's when it's good.If you don't know what poutine is, well, at the minimum it is crispy fries, thick chicken gravy, and unpasteurized cheddar cheese curds. The saltiness of the gravy and the crispness of the fries is important, otherwise it ends up being a being disgusting mess. Ideally, the cheese is unpasteurized for way more flavor, and never refrigerated (non-pasteurized dairies -- I'll freak some people out). Best scenario, the cheese squeeks/sings in your mouth.I was really excited to try Pomme Frites poutine, and it was OK in 2006 but it was nearly inedible when I returned a couple months ago. This poutine had thick but undercooked fries and curds that had been frozen/thawed too many times (no flavor -- I couldn't even tell if it was cheddar curds or not). The gravy was OK. In fact, it's the exact same I use to make poutine at home in Virginia (loney's, see picture -- I saw it in their backroom). Better would have been to make it from chicken fat, just like a turkey gravy. Maybe I am a poutine snob, but in the end did not really enjoy the final product. I wouldn't eat it again.Disappointed too? Cook a better one yourself.

She tells me that they're authentic Belgian fries, first of all, and that the fries are fried twice to give it a golden, crispier texture. Awesome. But what really set them apart, she continued, was the cornucopia of dipping sauces they had and how it really changes the taste of fries... better than the traditional ketchup and ranch. Sold! Onto ordering...She offers to get us samples of ANY of their sauces. I don't remember all of the ones I tried but I remember liking pretty much every single one. The sauces are GOOD. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering their double cone and I think it's safe to say that our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs... and we can eat a LOT of fries, lol! The double is HUGE.

But not really bad or anything. \u00a0If this is a \"feast\" for the nose, I don't think whoever wrote the menu can really handle roses, or simmering onions and garlic, or chocolate chips cookies fresh from the oven. \u00a03. \u00a0Touch. \u00a0Hm. \u00a0French fries are traditionally a finger food. \u00a0And I guess there's nothing like that good old feeling of singeing your fingers on super-hot and fresh frites. \u00a0This is kind of similar to \"smell\" where there's definitely 'touch' going on, and it's not really bad or anything, but I'd be hard pressed to call it a \"feast\" for the senses. \u00a04. \u00a0Sound. \u00a0OK, this is where things start to go awry. \u00a0What I heard on my most recent trip to get a poutine fix was a mix of Z100 blaring extremely bad pop hits (could have been worse, could have been one of those stations that plays nothing but Christmas songs from mid-October through January) and woefully obnoxious NYU students and/or people who seemed to be on impossibly bad dates. \u00a0Seriously, the couple next to me were alternating between awkward silence and half-hearted banter about how, like, potatoes are, like, really good, you know, no matter how you cook them. \u00a0potatoes rock! \u00a0I really hope they were stoned. \u00a0Mark one sense out of the \"feast\" running for sure.5. \u00a0Sight. \u00a0Another one bites the dust. \u00a0This place is tiny, cramped with people who are by no means easy on the eyes, and dirty as all get out. \u00a0Seriously, I'm getting ready to take a long trip to India, and I'm basing my standards on the cleanliness of street food, tea stalls, and the like on a \"Cleaner Than Pommes Frites\" scale. \u00a0If it's dirtier than a french fry shack in the East Village, I'm not going in there. \u00a0While I'm sure the hygeine is fine, it sure ain't pretty in there. \u00a0If this is a \"feast\" for the eyes, I'm on a diet, thanks.Aside from all that silliness, though, Pommes Frites rocks. \u00a0It's hard to mess up hot fresh french fries and your choice of like a kajillion different sauces. \u00a0And the poutine is fine, sorry. \u00a0It's not better than what you can get in Montreal. \u00a0But it's not worse than any of the more average poutines I've tried, either. \u00a0I might even have had worse. \u00a0Regarding the cheese, I'm pretty sure it's real curds, but I'm guessing they're old-ish or artificially preserved somehow in a way that removes the squeak. \u00a0The taste and texture were perfect, and I could tell from looking at them that they weren't just hunks of white cheddar. \u00a0The gravy was pretty damn spot on, too. \u00a0The only real difference was that the fries used in poutine tend to be of the skinny genre, and these are not. \u00a0But it's not as if Pommes Frites is going to make two different fry shapes just for the Canadians out there. \u00a0Hey, just be happy it's not the poutine mutation known in the states as \"Disco Fries\".", "Date": "2007-12-18", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike C.", "ReviewID": "U0Z21MYBou7zwqKxgK75iw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where would I be without WikiPedia:French fries (American English, sometimes capitalized[1]), fries,[2] or French-fried potatoes are thin strips of deep-fried potato.[3] Americans often refer to any elongated pieces of fried potatoes as fries, while in other parts of the world, most notably the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, long, thinly cut slices of fried potatoes are called fries to distinguish them from the thickly cut strips called chips.[4] French fries are known as frites or pommes frites in French, a name which is also used in many non-French-speaking areas, and have names that mean \"fried potatoes\" or \"French potatoes\" in others.Historically, addiction has been defined as physical and psychological dependence on psychoactive substances (for example alcohol, tobacco, heroin and other drugs) which cross the blood-brain barrier once ingested, temporarily altering the chemical milieu of the brain.Addiction can also be viewed as a continued involvement with a substance or activity despite the negative consequences associated with it. Pleasure and enjoyment would have originally been sought, however over a period of time involvement with the substance or activity is needed to feel normal.[1] Some psychology professionals and many laymen now mean 'addiction' to include abnormal psychological dependency on such things as gambling, food, sex, pornography, computers, internet, work, exercise, idolizing, watching TV or certain types of non-pornographic videos, spiritual obsession, cutting and shopping.[2][3][4][5]__________________________________________________\u00ad_________Sam Sifton says--\"DId someone slip something into Mike C's jumbo martini. \u00a0His review of Pommes Frites makes less sense than his normal inane ramblings.\"SpiderMan says: \u00a0\"Let the critics loose on him instead!\"Hoover spokesman-\"It sucks.\"Stoli spokesman--\"Time to deliver another case over there.\"Pommes Frites worker: \u00a0\"WTF--that must be the guy we have to lube the door with mayo for him to squeeze/waddle through.\"Pommes Frites owner: \u00a0\"Thanks Mike C for putting my kid through grad school.\"", "Date": "2011-02-12", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "tony t.", "ReviewID": "48UweCL9BxkZaOhWeYdHKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A regular is a great snack for 2 if you don't each much", "Date": "2013-11-17", "Author_Location": "Bronx, NY"}, {"Author": "Anthony P.", "ReviewID": "QJKWomFHYZljN9Oea0uXeQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Doesn't compare to pommes frites in Europe.

The first bottom layer is fries (secret to pomme frites is to double fry, i learned this from some guy i met that night who own a fry place in another state), you smash em up in the cup. Then you layer a gravy sauce (brown) on it then you throw in some CHEESE CURDS. Yup, ya heard. Cheese curd balls.. throw em in the mix. Then layer the fries and repeat with gravy and curds. They hand you this little unknown cup of magic. So my fiancee and I started away and before you know it we had a crowd around us. Everyone was ooooh's and aaaaaw's about what we were eating. We made some nice NYC momentary friends and some other business men that hung out with us. It was a good crowd of 12 all eating poutin.

You watch the potatoes turn golden brown and just cook in all of the oil then they take them out and you watch those Belgian Fries shimmer and shine, they add some salt and pepper and bada bing there done. Yes the sauces are a $1 each but don't be that boring generic guy who just gets ketchup, these fries deserve better than that or get the combo of 3 sauces for $2.50 extra. I ended up getting the War Sauce (which def had a peanut taste to it, sort of like Thai food) , Rosemary Garlic (pretty damn good but if has a heavy rosemary taste and smell to it), honey mustard mayo (meh kind of crappy) and the Organic Black Truffle Mayo (which was $1.75 but was by far my favorite one and literally had me begging for more!)

Belgian fries, huh? With mayo? I despise mayo, so Pomme Frites was moved down on my list of places to try when I moved to New York. I attempted to stand in line (sober, mind you), but was too impatient. Months later, an exciting night of music and libations at Lit Lounge down the block put me in the right mood to try out the starchy late night snack. The intriguing thing about Pomme Frites is texture. Fresh cut fries are oil-seared in a vat and laid to rest under a heating lamp. When patrons order, batches are fried a second time in front of you while the fry cooks help you decide between their array of dipping sauces. I was almost full from eating all of the free samples! You'd think the small, dingy spot was run by friends from across the pond, but it is strangely run by all Filipinos. It may explain the addition of Asian-style sauces to the menu: Thai Peanut, Pomegranate Teriyaki, Vietnemese Pineapple and Wasabi Mayo. \u00a0One of the men behind the counter smiled at me and just stared for a good 10 seconds before he said, \"What size frites do you want?\" in a heavy accent.Since I was by myself I wanted the smallest one, which is still a hefty lot for one girl! The fry cook stared for a little bit more and said something in Tagalog to the other two guys behind the counter. Then, as he was making my order, they stared at me. I was weirded out, so I raised my eyebrows to acknowledge that I knew they were staring. One cook came over to me and leaned over the counter, \"Sorry, its just that you look just like Joyce Jimenez.\"Oh, I look like a Filipino movie star? Will you refill my fries for free? Should I move now or later to start my movie career in the Philippines?I had to put my dreams of a future in foreign romance films on hold, I had fried tubers in my hand. My friend behind the counter wanted me to try his blend of ketchup, chinese hot pepper oil and Sriracha \u00a0hot sauce that did not appear on the menu. It flared my nostrils up, realllll good. \u00a0I also tried the mango ketchup, which was sweet--but mismatched with the saltiness of the fries. Besides paper cones full of fries, you can get a cup of poutine (popularly known as \"Disco fries\") or fries in gravy and cheese.You're not meant to hang here for long. Canned sodas are available, but no bathroom or large booths. The predominantly wood surfaced bar area has little cone holders for your fries. To avoid the line, hit this place before the dinner crowd or before the late night bar hoppers do. My suggestion is to imbibe some happy hour cocktails with friends, saunter over to Pomme Frites and share a small cone for under $5.00.

Its the only sauce most true to its name, and it goes really well with fries. The sweet mango chutney was good, but its sweet after all, so not exactly the best with fries.

It is no surprise then to find that some, not a great deal, of the priciest real estate in the world is devoted solely to french fries, or rather pommes frites. The difference between what comes from the freezer and then has its slow demise incubated beneath a heat lamp and the product at the Frite Shoppe known as Pommes Frites (123 2nd Ave. New York City, NY) is not so much a difference as it is a paradigm shift.Home of \"Autentic (sic) Belgian Fries\" served in paper cones of increasingly appreciable size, this stand fries thick-cut potato wedges in the manner known commonly as pommes Pont-Neuf in one of two boiling pots of oil (and, I hope, some sort of delicious animal fat). There is an endless roll call of sauces to choose from and while many are free others will cost you 75 cents; if that surcharge offends then you are better off scouring a value menu somewhere else. On a napkin I was proffered a sampling of horseradish mayo, Irish curry, Mexican ketchup and Sambal Olek (Hot Chili Paste) and enough french fries to power all the dangling women in the Ford Modeling Agency lobby through the holiday weekend.The experience was not unlike being in an ice cream shop as a child. I was allowed to taste and try different flavors, there were holes cut out in a bar that held the cones of fries and the sauces had the sheen of seduction that hot fudge and caramel engender.Satisfied and pleased but unwilling to commit to any of the sauces on such a grand scale, I chose European Mayo. Mildly concerned that the top fries would be suffocated in the custardy condiment, the fry-cook ameliorated my fears by squirting a health dose of European Mayo half way through then topped off my cone with fries and proceed to drizzle them in a manner that would have disgusted Vincent Vega but made me proud of my body's trained indifference to cholesterol.Whether or not the mayonnaise was European is questionable; it seemed ready to congeal tins of tuna or slide around a bit of roast beef. This mayonnaise would not have been offended if discolored by French's mustard. This was not the mayonnaise that Thomas Pynchon dreamt of, but it was viscous, and not unctuous, and retained its composition under the duress of steaming hot fries and Manhattan humidity. However, the fries were terrific. Usually, I prefer thinner fries, shoestring or pommes allumettes as they are known in older, more \"Autentic\" countries; nevertheless, these fries were well engineered. Their thickness kept them hot throughout the meal and made their quality seem reasonable without forcing the glutton to contemplate delusion. A fork seemed snobbish at first, but it became prudent and civilized once I removed the fingerprints on my thumb and forefinger.Luckily, European Mayo is also a highly restorative salve.In retrospect, I would suggest the $4 regular size instead of the large, which I purchased. I was young and needed the money. I believed this would be my main source of calories, so I splurged. Anyone who single-handedly buys a \"double\" for personal use will look like a suffering peasant in an Ilya Repin painting.In a perfect world these fries would accompany the flesh of some large, benevolent herbivore and a sample of leafy greens. Alas, Pommes Frites is a niche business, and just one niche of a larger niche or, comme ils dissent en France, \"une de beaucoup de specialties.\" There are still shoestring virtuosos and pommes pailes, (\"potato straws\") specialists to be rooted out of New York's labyrinth of ground-level and subterranean shacks, windows and unmarked vendors.Clearly, I know almost no French.", "Date": "2008-10-02", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "David G.", "ReviewID": "tKBuD3Nb45DYThFohv2cBQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm envious of this place.

Potatoes aren't even that expensive - ouch. However, they really do fry them fresh when you order them, and they ARE in St. Mark's Place. And they're incredibly generous with the free samples. Today was the second time I've been here (twice in two days, actually), and I was pleasantly surprised by the service both times. Although you're supposed to only have one free sample, the guy throws in extra sauces (5 of them - really well-chosen ones, too). He also gave me a free sauce (Vietnamese Pineapple yesterday and two of a mysterious, delicious sauce today). I don't know if he does this for everyone else cus he was like \"Shhh ...\" but whatever it is, yay :) The fries are alright - not the best I've had, but quite good, and much better with the sauces. Sauces I've tried so far: - Mango Chutney: most popular, and for a good reason. It's sweet, but not overpoweringly so. It doesn't really taste like mangoes to me, but it's quite distinctive and yummy. - Smoked Eggplant: I was dubious about this one and how the eggplant flavor would come out, but it emerges very, very well. It's probably my favorite. - Rosemary Garlic: Mmmm - rosemary and garlic are two of my favorite flavors. This is an excellent blend of the two for a really great sauce. - Vietnamese Pineapple - Sweet, complex, and exotic. :D- Wild Mushroom - Tastes like mushrooms! Kind of like a beef stroganoff sauce. Really good. - Organic Black Truffle - I don't actually know which one this was, but either of them were really good. Sorry. - Parmesan - Good, but I'd rather have one of the other ones. We sat by the crowded bar for a little bit, but a table cleared up. Score! :D I love that they have holes in the table to put the fry cones. What a fantastic idea. They also have AC, which is great.

I want to at least like it, but I just can't. Their only saving grace is their variety of sauces, though I can't even vouch for much given how I've only tried a fraction of them. I first heard of Pommes Frites on a Food Network special eons back so I've had a lot of time to build up my anticipation, only to be let down so bad.Day or night, long line or no line, the fries are always consistently disappointing to me. Obviously I expect grease given how they're double-fried, but what I don't expect is copious amounts of it. Oh and if the fries aren't blackened to death in parts, they're weird soggy pieces of mush. I have yet once to bite into crisp crunchy fries. C'mon, even McDonalds can do that.Despite the lines that may stretch down the sidewalk, service is pretty quick. If you're not sure which sauces you want, I'd suggest hitting up Pommes Frites when it's slow so that people behind you don't glare you to death as you sample this and that. I won't deny it, it drives me nuts when someone wants to try 10 different sauces, knowing how long the line is.If you're in the area, if you're drunk, etc etc come through and they probably won't disappoint you too much. 2 stars because I like the little holes in the tables for the cones and I'm rather fond of the mango chutney mayo and several other sauces.

Nothing awesome. They were good fries. I'm assuming slightly bit healthier as well, even if it's fried in all that glorious oil. Pricing's not that bad. It's a specialized little street food, and the cost to keep that hole in the wall running, with workers, fresh potatoes, and vast amounts of sauces, it's reasonable. Pricing for a small cone of fries - $4.50, which can easily be lunch or split between two people. The thing that makes this place special is the vast variety in dipping sauce (20-30 kinds), all of which are $1.00. Coming as a group definitely helps in getting to try more sauces. The fries themselves were not all that salty, but I don't know. Feels like just alright fries. Lets get real: It's a hole in the wall. If you're expecting service, pay up and go to a restaurant. The guys here will do their job: 1) ask you what you want, 2) Do it as soon as possible and efficiently. It gets a little busy sometimes, so if they mess up, be cool and they'll make a change for you. Tip them ONLY if you feel they've done a little more than that. There's a small seating area in the back (fitting maybe 8-13 people), if you're lucky to get a seat and sit down to do nothing. Would I go back here desperately to try the fries? No. Only other time this place would come into my head would be probably as an appetizer before dinner/lunch, or something to eat before a night at the bar (and there are SO many bars around--it makes sense).

Tubby McTubster filled to the eyebrowfat with pommes frites from Pommes Frites! I'd get that way despite my psychotic work out schedule because I'd constantly have these pommes frites in my mouth. \"Because I breathe, I eat pommes frites\" would become my mantra. I'd ask Tom Cruise's space god to kill me while eating pommes frites, because then I'd die getting the satisfaction that \"love\" and \"sex\" had failed to do all my life. Life is complete with pommes frites.Pommes frites, aka french fries, are of course, actually a Belgian creation. As a result, the Belgians shall inherit the earth. And if you've never had pommes frites in Belgium, you can taste the serious, no, FUCKING MAGICAL deliciousness of a perfect french fry at Pommes Frites. Because this is New York, Pommes Frites does not have any Belgians working this fried food shop. It appears, instead, to be staffed by Filipinos, who, seemed to replace the Israeli staff from a couple years prior. No matter, they all did it right. They all fried the potatoes just so that it was crispy, hot on the outside, and potato-y on the inside. Pommes Frites offers an array of sauces that can be smothered on the frites if you're read to eat to win right there and then, or served on the side. But who can actually wait?! My poison is the pesto mayo. D-FUCKING-LICIOUS! I always get it. It is the perfect condiment to the frites. It MAKES YOU WANT TO MASTURBATE after the snack/meal-of-the day. A regular size runs about $3.75 or so, and that's a lot of french fries. Eating a double by yourself might be hazardous not because of any tearing of the stomach, but because the food coma that would ensue might cause you to fall asleep slightly while you cross the street.

However, when you strip away the massive assortment of Mayonnaise Dipping Sauces and the Belgian style interior design, what your left with is only exceptionally oily steak fries that are a multitude more expensive than what you can get at your average fast food joint.Here I ordered a large thing of fries alongside some of the signature Pomegranate Teriyaki and Mango Chutney sauces. The order only took about five minutes and they were quick to hand over the fries. The problem with this is that the fries are served in a wonky shaped cone and about a tenth of my order fell off in the process of it simply being handed over to me. While I know it's authentic to serve it this way but the entire process just felt very heavy handed to me, maybe the paper could be larger or less flimsy.To its credit though, the large fries were pretty much the only thing I ate all day and by the end of it I could hardly even move but I felt this was more of grease and fat overload (from the Mayonnaise) than it was from the food actually being fulfilling or well made. While I was able to finish it (barely), most of the other people around me quit about halfway through. It was probably a better idea, I felt completely trashed after eating it. A small would be more than sufficient.While all the reviews on Yelp seem to love the Mango Chutney, I wasn't really a big fan. I don't really feel like the sweet taste of Mango really complements mayonnaise much at all let alone when paired with French Fries. Likewise, the Teriyaki Pomegranate sauce came off as a bit strong in the Horse Raddish sense of the word, not necessarily spicy but a bit offensive nonetheless.My friend defended this place saying that it's the most delicious thing in the world if it is near 1 am and you are drunk after hitting up a few bars but honestly, if you have to be drunk to fully enjoy the food at a place, is that really that high of a standard at all?", "Date": "2009-11-04", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Ben B.", "ReviewID": "aqT7vXyzWd6zwn4lLfYTXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Whether it's as a side order, a snack, or a drunken munchie, french fries always make sense. What's great about fries is that they work in all different sizes and styles too-thick, skinny, shoe-string, long, short, crispy, well-done, seasoned, unseasoned, and even soggy. Everyone has their favorite place for fries-hopefully not McDonalds or Burger King-but in the East Village, there is no better fry joint than Pommes Frites off St. Mark's Place.Pommes Frites has been a popular eatery from the get-go and it's open until 1 AM from Sunday to Thursday, and 3:30 AM from Friday to Saturday-which makes it even more of a \"spot.\" Considering PF offers traditional Belgian french fries with around 30 different dipping sauces, late-night fast foods runs should soon become obsolete.They off three sizes-regular, large, double-but keep in mind, the regular is plenty for two people. PF uses Idaho potatoes, and they cut them thick-Belgium style. They're placed in the fryer, and when the fries are just right, they're thrown into a bowl where they are properly seasoned and tossed around. The result is pure beauty-thick, perfectly browned fries, served up in a cone.This is the difficult part, though. Picking a sauce will literally drive you crazy. For $1 a pop, you can choose from a list of, yes, 30 different sauces. As if ketchup, mustard, or mayo wasn't sufficient, they had to put you through the additional, and arguably wonderful, stress of selecting an inventive homemade dipping sauce. To name a few, Pommes Frites offers a rosemary garlic mayo, roasted garlic mayo, pesto mayo, horseradish mayo, peanut satay, Mexican ketchup, curry ketchup, and so many more.In addition, for $5 (small) or $6 (large), they also offer Poutine, which is a Canadian classic featuring the likes of Canadian cured cheddar cheese and chicken gravy. If there are two things the Canadians do well, it's hockey and Poutine. If you're looking for a happy heart attack, Poutine will become your best friend.If you're not a fan of lines, go to Pommes Frites before bars-but then again, if you want the ultimate post-bar food, skip the mediocrity at fast food joints (or even the somehow beloved falafel at Mamoun's), and hop on-line at Pommes Frites.Frites Prices: Regular ($4.50), Large ($6.25), and Double ($7.75)Note: if you want multiple sauces, which you should, you can get 3 sauces for $2.50 (hey, that's $.50 off!).Contact:123 2nd Ave (between 7th St & St Marks Pl)(212) 674-1234PommesFrites.ws", "Date": "2010-05-27", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Corey H.", "ReviewID": "iO_aOVY27ZKB6wR7eyZtAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was January 2, 2009.

Well, this may not be the exact same thing, but it tastes like the stuff on the garlic knot. And you control the dipping!

Now, with that said, if you're in the east village and happen to be a fry lover (like myself) you would be doing a disservice to yourself by not stopping by and at least getting a regular with at least 2 (or more) sauces. While singled out, neither the fries or the sauces are extraordinary (both are very good though), but combine the two in any fashion and you have yourself a treat made for a king (or Fry King). \u00a0 What exactly do you get here? \u00a0You get one honkin' funnel of fries (in three different sizes) and more than enough sauces to choose from. \u00a0As a note to those who want to get a little more bang for their buck: choose the fries to go as they will generally double up the size funnel you have and pack the fries in even more. \u00a0I would estimate that you get an additional 10 - 15% this way.As another user has pointed out, location is everything. And they could not have been more correct. This place is in a great location, close to NYU, bars, clubs, and of course, the east village (well, it's actually in the east village, not by it, but you get the picture). And because of that, you generally have swarms of college students and the like waiting in a line that is rarely contained in the actual store for upwards of 20 minutes just to get fries! Now, why did I not give this place a 5 star review? My only reasoning is that their fries have a tendency to be overly oily which I would peg as their only downfall. I don't know if it is the type of oil they use, the length for which they use a single batch, their cleaning of the fryers, or any combination of the three, but something is just a little off.

They seem to be bottomless, so it makes no difference if you eat them alone or share them with a friend. (Or like ten friends, the biggest size is BIG.) And oh... the sauces. The sauces. My personal favorites are the rosemary garlic mayo, the parmesan peppercorn, and the dill lemon mayo. I've never had poutine, but when I try it, it will be at Pommes Frites. I trust them with potatoes and chicken fat. The only complaint I have is that it can get VERY crowded. So the best time to go is late afternoon/early evening, between meals.

Pommes Frites serves authentic Belgian fries with a multitude of sauces to pair with them. Justin and I ordered a small cone of fries to share (which, by the way, is NOT small!), and had a difficult time deciding on a sauce. Thankfully, it wasn't busy at the time and we were allowed to sample a few different ones before making a decision. The parmesan garlic mayo was the winner for us, but we also loved the sundried tomato mayo, the pesto mayo, the smoked eggplant mayo...and the list goes on. Also - classic ketchup can never go wrong.The fries are relatively thick cut, with skin still attached (I love a french fry this way). They were crispy on the outside, and pillowy soft on the inside. And the best part? They were fried to order! Pommes Frites only starts frying your french fries after you order, so you won't get a cone filled with lukewarm potatoes. You've got to love that.

I am one hell of a fan of steak fries. Though the thicker than average (ha) steak fry can be hit or miss. Some places don't cook it long enough leaving an unappetizing hard, yet soggy, inside, while others try to avoid that by over cooking and therefore drying up the delicious potato.

It was more than enough, and I unfortunately think that there may have been a straggler or two that survived the massacre. Now let's touch upon the sauces!! They have an overwhelming variety to choose from. I think there's a free standard sauce you can get, but we went with the combo order (3 for like $2.50) and chose the Irish Curry, Wasabi mayo, and Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo. I'm not the biggest fan of wasabi and therefore thought it tasted like nyquil. That said, my girlfriend does enjoy wasabi, but also thought this sauce wasn't great. The pineapple mayo was ok at best. I promptly left those two sauces to my girlfriends disposal while I ravaged the Irish curry. I cannot impress on you enough the amazement that is this curry!!!I hail from the Emerald Isle myself, and LOVE Irish Curry. For those of you on here that don't understand what makes it Irish, just know that it tastes exactly how they make it over there. That should be enough for ya. : )The only drawbacks I had were that the staff were a little snappy to us when we decided to order more sauce (they're aware that means more money for them right?) and the malt vinegar. It was some weak vinegar. As I said, I'm originally from Ireland and know my salt and vinegar on chips. This vinegar had me soaking my fries through just to get a little taste!The space is also really small, but we were still able to get seating in the back.

FOOD QUALITY:There's no doubt that their fries are cooked and seasoned properly; It has a nice subtle crunch on the exterior and it's soft in the middle without it being too soft or hard. Salted enough to bring out the potatoes, but not overly salted to overshadow the fries or mayo/ketchups. HOWEVER .. Three flavors -- Mango Chutney, Black Truffle, and Roasted Garlic. As much as I want to say I liked these particular mayos, I didn't really necessarily enjoy trying all three of them subsequently. Mango chutney was sweet with a very subtle kick to it, but the majority was still the base flavor of mayo. Black Truffle had a strong savory savoriness to it, and I wish I could say more about this but I could only taste savory mayo .. Roasted Garlic? Savory. Salty. Really salty. Still mayo based.My point is, after eating so many fries and dipping it in some mayo-based sauce, it really becomes a drag to eat because the sauces are thick-textured like regular mayo is. I think it would be good if they were actually sauces -- to highlight the potato flavors and textures instead of competing with it to be the limelight. Potatoes are already thick in texture and mayo, unlike ketchup that has a thin feeling texture & stark contrast flavor, only adds to what the potato already has.ENVIRONMENT:So. Freaking. Cramped.

I also got the peanut satay, the sweet mango, the curry ketchup and the free one which is just onions, ketchup and mayo.

Since then I have eaten at this place twice more, not so much because I fell in love with it right away, but more because I felt like I had to try three different sauces in order to give this place a fair review.The place itself is adorable, as you can tell from the photos it has three tall wooden chairs in front of it which are usually taken. Once you enter it, the place is really narrow and you stand by a counter, usually in a somewhat long line, where you order from. There are two tables in the back which fit about 4-5 people each and a bar which could fit about as many. The wooden tables have holes in them that are meant for the cones, I think that is both cute and a brilliant idea. The service is pretty quick and efficient and I would say for the amount of fries you get that they are not overpriced. Also, they do not have a bathroom that is available for customers from what I could tell.First time I came here I ordered the Frites sauce because it just seemed appropriate. I didn't plan for this to be my full meal, more like a \"snack\" so I shared the regular size with another person and for a \"snack\" it was really filling. The fries themselves were thick, mostly soft yet crunchy at times. They were not too salty which was good they actually had just the right amount of salt, however I cant say they were extraordinary. The sauce on the other hand was pretty good. My second time here I tried the Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo with my friend and I absolutely loved this sauce, you can barely taste the mayo and the sweetness is really subtle, definitely recommended for people who are not much of mayo fans. Third time I decided that these regular sized frites are going to be my actual lunch and for the most part I had them all to myself. The result was that I could not finish them, when combined with the sauce it is pretty filling. That time I tried the Roasted Garlic Mayo which I had my eye on for some time but unfortunately it was a disappointment, I cant put my finger on what exactly I didn't like about it, but at some point I just gave up on the sauce and ate those fries with ketchup.

The tiny restaurant nestled between 7th Street & St. Mark's Place on 2nd Avenue that literally sits around eight is known for having some of the best fries in the city and allows customers to sample their many sauces for free. The wait the first time I tried to go (over a month ago as the temperature was dropping significantly) piqued my curiosity. It was 1am and the line was out the door, despite the freezing weather. I put Pommes Frites on my list, and promised myself I would come back at a more appropriate time.That time came on a Saturday morning. I hit the place up right when it was due to open at 11:30 on the weekend. The sign read \"Closed.\" I hiked the block and returned 10 minutes later. The sign now read \"Open\" and there was a line. I barely squeezed myself in the front door.I watched as new batches of cut potatoes fried while the people in front of me sampled and ordered one of the 30 sauces Pommes Frites features with their fries. The fries are served in a cone and come in three sizes: regular, large, and double. Sauces are $1.00 extra, or you can order a combo of any three sauces for $2.50. When my turn arrived, I asked for a sample of the Sundried Tomato Mayo and the Peanut Satay. The guy behind the fry bar handed me a napkin with four small fries on it and a small dollop of both sauces. The Peanut Satay was too oily for me. I ordered a regular order of fries with a combo of the following three sauces: Rosemary Garlic Mayo, Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo, and the Sundried Tomato Mayo. The regular portion was huge; it took me two settings to finish it. The fries were a bit on the soggy side, but the sauces were very good. The Rosemary Garlic had the perfect combination of garlic and mayo; the Mango was very sweet and tasted almost like Thousand Island Salad Dressing, and the Sundried Tomato was also sweet with a slight kick at the end. I did not favor one sauce over the other as all were equally delicious. The complimentary raw onions were a nice touch as well. \u00a0For out-of-towners, if you are looking for an authentic New York experience, Pommes Frites has it. Belgium is known for its frites, so anyplace claiming to have \"authentic Belgian fries\" is a must go.

The three of us shared an order of regular fries with combo sauces. I only remember for sure two out of the three sauces that we got to pick, sadface, but I think that's because we didn't choose such good sauces and only liked one of them mainly. We had the Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo, Curry Ketchup and Peanut Satay (I think). We all liked the pineapple one the best because it was interesting in a good way and had a slight sweetness to it. The curry ketchup I wasn't a fan of, it tasted interesting in a bad way. It did taste like curry and ketchup and while I like them separately I guess both of them in the same sauce just isn't my cup of tea. I didn't really like the peanut satay either probably because I'm not a major fan of peanut or anything related (even my pb&j sandwiches I put minimal peanut butter on it). So I'd suggest the pineapple sauce for sure.... if you order the combo sauces well I'm sorry you're kind of on your own on that. :POverall my experience was just okay, I think it might be because we didn't make a great selection on the sauces, but I would get the pineapple mayo again and I'll just chance it on the other two and hopefully they'll be better. I love how they have unique sauces so I'd be down to try some more if I get the chance, I'll always have the pineapple to fall back on anyways!", "Date": "2011-08-27", "Author_Location": "East Bay, CA"}, {"Author": "Tina P.", "ReviewID": "0GoEVE9PSt_dFBPozw7R_A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in fries heaven!

There was always a line, but it was never long, and when I didn't have time to wait around for one of the few cool (but small) tables, I just headed home and ate the dish while playing Blades of Steel on my NES. Truly, it was a paradise.I have since returned to Pomme Frites, and while it has changed in some ways, the quality hasn't. It's a little more expensive than my fledgling days, but still not bad.

My roommate got a deal from Scoutmob (excellent resource by the way) so we went to this small but busy joint to try its fries and best yelped dips. I was drawn by their selection of dips. I did my research on yelp to avoid falling into the paradox of choice. The inside was small but cozy. It was modeled after a wooden cabin, maybe something you'd find for respite at a ski resort. The service was relatively quick considering it was packed but the employees seemed so overwhelmed that sometimes they would forget to talk to us or even take our money. I would normally take it as rudeness and bad service, but one of the employee's sheepish apologetic smile made me forgive him. My roommate and I ordered large belgian fries with a combo (3 sauces) of war sauce, rosemary garlic mayo, and sundried tomato mayo. I didn't really like the latter too because the taste of mayo was too overwhelming for my personal palate. The rosemary garlic mayo had a strong rosemary scent and the sundried tomato mayo didn't really taste like tomato. it was just a tad sour and had a red tinge. However, I really liked the war sauce, mostly because it was unique in and of itself. it's made up of Frite Sauce, Peanut Satay, and raw onion.

A lot of people seem to expect a lot from their french fry, and may have lofty expectations for such a pedestrian food.The belgian fries are everything on the menu. Well, besides the multitude of optional sauces. The basic ones are included in the cost, such as ketchup, mustard, or frite sauce (which is mayo-based). The more interesting sauces are an additional charge and are not exactly optional for those who like to spice things up a bit.Ah, but I have digressed a bit. Back to the fries themselves. Big, thick cuts of freshly-peeled potatoes bathe in bubbling hot oil for your palate's pleasure. They cook each batch of frites to order, and mostly because they otherwise cannot possibly keep up with demand. There's always a line. The fries are a tad on the greasy side, but not overly so. The are cooked to just crispy, tossed with salt, and poured into a paper cone. You can then walk with them, or cram yourself into a seat in the back of the shop, which, conveniently has holes in the tables to hold the frites cones.Now, back to the sauces. While I won't list the sauces here, I'll mention that the range is based on things like curry, sweet chili, chutneys, spicy ketchup, a lot of mayo-based sauces, and even a few satay sauces. Its a huge list. Just head down and try them.Money might not buy happiness, but it will surely buy a few minutes of fried-potato bliss. So go and have a coneful of heaven.

The first time I had pommes frites was in Belgium and I have to say that Pommes Frites in New York will give Belgium a run for their money. I absolutely love fries and the fact that there are a ton of sauces to dip those bad boys in, just makes life complete. Right when I stepped in I was greeted by the sweetest Pinoys behind the counter. Big smiles and ready to make my pommes frite wishes come true. I ordered the regular, HUGE, pommes frites with their special sauce combo (3 sauces). As I was trying to make my sauce choices, we chatted about our heritage, NY, they tried to teach me some tagalog, and thankfully helped me make the right sauce decisions. I first decided on Roasted Garlic Mayo, Vietnamese pineapple, and Sweet Mango Chutney. However, being the spicy fan that I am, I asked which sauce was the spiciest. This is where my foodie dreams came true. One of the guys leaned in and asked me in Tagalog if I really liked spicy? Ummm yah! So he discretely pulled out a sauce that was not on the menu, poured some on a napkin next to some sample frites, and the tasting began. OMGoodness! So good! It was his special concoction and it \u00a0did not fail to impress. It was spicy and paired well with the frites. So BIG TIP, ask for a special spicy sauce not on the menu.After that, my pommes frites were served up with my collection of sauces. If you I like your frites crispy, do not be shy to ask them to make them extra crispy for you. Every bite was simply delicious. My frites were crispy and every sauce complimented them perfectly. My favorite sauce besides the secret spicy sauce, was the Sweet Mango Chutney. It tasted like Thailand. Basically, Pomme Frites is the best place to head over to when you are having your European frite cravings. These are Pommes Frites that I will not be sharing, even with people I like.

The joint did not survive long, but to our dining pleasure, a similar spot called \"B Frites\" popped up in Midtown; while seating was limited, the fries were fantastic and the 10+ dipping sauces a hit. Then, on a brisk winter day during my middle school years, my father and I were met with tragedy as we walked up to our favorite snacking spot only to discover \"B Frites\" had kicked the can. I can't quite remember if I cried, but judging by the grief my heart still bears, tears were likely. HOWEVER, the Belgian fried potato movement triumphed over past tragedies with the opening of \"Pommes Frites\" in the East Village. This narrow, closet-sized hotspot serves up cones of golden, twice fried Belgian spuds complemented by your choice of over 25 gourmet dipping sauces that surely have its predecessors smiling in their restaurant graves. For dipping I recommend trying the Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo, Parmesan Peppercorn, and War Sauce, but you honestly cannot go wrong here, so try something exotic!

That's a shame, because corner joints like Pommes Frites are being the Daniel Boulud's of french fries, each putting its own unique, gourmet spin on the McDonald's staple. Pommes Frites takes the Belgian route, making their fries big, thick and salty, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Pommes does its frying in, for lack of a better word, a shack. It's wooden, dark, and crowded, making it a real hot spot for a late night snack. Most cases, you'll be waiting outside on a short line, watching loads and loads of potato slices being fried in vats of bubbling oil. Don't come here to lose weight. When it's your turn, you chose a size (this is a fry shack - it's fries or the sidewalk for you), and take my word, a small is quite filling. As you're waiting for your fries, you need to really think hard: which sauce do I want? The sauces make the shack on the brink of legendary. There are 20 plus obscure sauces for you to chose from, including gourmet fry regulars like garlic mayo and honey mustard and newcomers like mango chutney. (Side note: the Pommes staff and I agree: mango chutney \u00a0may sound like the grossest thing to put on fries, but by god is it delicious, a perfect mixture of sweet and salty.) Once you get your fries, be warned, because these are addictive. Also, make sure you find a nearby place outside of Pommes for you to sit down and devour your fries.

They have oodles (30, actually) of exotic sauces available for only 75 cents per extra sauce (each order of fries comes with any one sauce); peanut satay, rosemary roasted garlic mayo, and honey mustard mayo are a few. Of course, they do serve ketchup....but that's so...ordinary! Their most popular sauce is the sweet mango chutney - one Omer and Suzanne invented the shop's opening year. \u00a0However, don't forget the chopped onions! \u00a0Mix them with the sauces to add an awesome crunch to your dipping.Enough talking. \u00a0Let's eat...and find out if anything Omer said was actually true! FoodGirl decided to go full out and asked for a double order (a cone larger than my entire head) for $7.50. \u00a0After much contemplation, I chose the smoked eggplant mayo and honey mustard sauces. \u00a0I picked up my first steaming golden-brown fry and took a bite. \u00a0My reaction: Oh my god. \u00a0Oh MY god. \u00a0OH MY GOD! When I first sunk my teeth into the fry, it crunched. \u00a0It was perfectly salted on the outside. \u00a0Then, once I bit past the crunch, the inside was so fluffy and potato-y! Mmmmmmm...It was like eating crunchy mashed potatoes....but much better! \u00a0Then, the sauces...they enhance the flavor even more with a special zing! I recommend the smoked eggplant mayo...offbeat enough to really crank the taste up to heaven! you like your fries extremely crunchy, the best part is at the base of the cone. \u00a0FoodGirl recommends using a fork to put a large dollop of sauce on all the little crunchy bits that have escaped to the bottom, mix it around, and consume! \u00a0his interview with FoodGirl, Omer's last comment was, \"You know, they may not be good for the heart, but they sure are good for the soul.\" \u00a0And so they are. I exited Pommes Frites smiling, full and contented; FoodGirl's craving for the perfect French Fries had finally been quelled...by the best fries in New York City! \u00a0 And so, Pommes Frites receives the FoodGirl Golden Fork Stamp of Approval. \u00a0See for yourself and give your taste buds a few delicious golden-brown moments of ecstasy!", "Date": "2009-07-04", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Megan B.", "ReviewID": "46LVBYdTZ0DuMA8m4ZuSrw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm sitting in my new Upper West Side apartment dreaming of this place.You can even order your fries extra crispy.

I always get the Peanut Satay and the Fritesaus (traditional european mayo). They also have poutine! which are Belgium fries smothered with brown gravy and curd cheese melted atop. The only turn off is the lines. . especially late at night can be close to 30 minutes, but well worth the wait. I complain every time and still end up waiting.

We walked into this cute little fry \"bar\" around 11 pm and apparently we managed to beat the drunken lower east side crowd. With a shared regular size of fries it was plenty, but if you're feeling extra fiendish for some glorious mayo dipping action, maybe you should up the size and just walk home 20 blocks. We got the pesto mayo and roasted garlic mayo and just for future reference for anyone excited about awesome and tasty combinations, spreading some of the roasted garlic mayo on top of a pastrami sandwich is the SHIZZLE. Don't doubt, just trust. There aren't a lot of places to sit down and eat inside Pommes Frites but there are counter spaces with little holes to hold your cone of fries. If you do get to sit in one of the corner tables though it's a great little dark, pub-like atmosphere.

One night after a brief bar jaunt through the NYU area, my crew and I stumbled upon this place, once just a vague \"bookmarked\" place on Yelp. I couldn't believe we'd actually found it, so of course I had to try it. I split a small cone with someone and ordered 2 sauces, the parmesan peppercorn and a garlic one. The verdict on the fries? Hot, fresh, and lightly seasoned, with not just salt! Bonus points. But the thing that pushes these fries to excellence is the mothereffin' sauce. Oh my goodness. They even let you sample some of the sauces with a fry! As if I could resist buying a cone to begin with. Not too much sitting area, but that's why it comes in a cone!

While my experience is not typical of a typical POMMES FRITES fanatic, nonetheless it was encouraging to have someone respond to a valid complaint. Bon appetit (sp?)! Original review in quotes below:\"I went to Pommes Frites a while back. The fries were decent enough. Seemed a bit mushy and not all that fresh even though the staffers fry everything on the spot. I ordered for take-out...but had so many problems ordering because it seemed like the counter people had barely a lick of English amongst them all at times or were too busy cooking to explain the pricing on sauces etc. There was one guy there who knew English, but he was constantly on the cordless phone. So I finally made a multi-sauce and french fry pick...had them bag it up and pay? I asked the woman if all the sauces were in there and she garbled out a yes...I headed home. When I opened the bag, I realized she got one out of 4 sauce choices right...and I realized I was overcharged by a few bucks. I was pretty pissed since it was long day of work and all I wanted to do was crack open a beer and chow on some comfort foods. But I spud-blocked by the workers of Pommes Frites! I called Pommes Frites back to explain the situation...a guy who could speak English picked up...I explained the situation. He apologized, but didn't even offer to refund or replace the sauces if I came back. What an @-hole! He seemed to rushed to go back to his phone chat line or whatever he was doing instead of running the fry joint. My other observation is no working that day was actually BELGIAN! Otherwise, I could have understood the whole I-don't-speak-English situation. lol.I will say this place is fried and needs a staff overhaul.

And the dudes behind the counter are always REALLY sweet and generous with their and super patient. And yes, you get fries to dip in your sample sauces. Yum!). So okay, staff is super nice. I was just there [again] and while I was waiting (alone) patiently for the guy behind the counter to fry up a fresh batch for me, he looks at [pathetic] me and says, \"...would you like to try a sample while you wait?\" Who else would do that?! Pesto mayo -- by far my favorite. It's rich and delicious. Love it much. Basil? Yum. They give you so much dipping sauce that I keep it on hand for when I have cooking endeavors (far and few they are!) at home. I ALWAYS get it... even if I'm in the mood for experimenting (sauces!). Sweet mango chutney mayo -- it's quite popular and everytime I go, the people in front of me order it and the people in back of me order it. Um...Hn? It tastes like sweet-and-sour-sauce to me, just thicker. Still, always good.Especial -- this one is free with an order of fries (along with generic ketchup, mustard, and mayo). It's mayo + ketchup + diced onions. Still... good business. Wild Mushroom -- Eh. I sampled it when it first came out and it had a bit of a bitter twang to it (I told the guys behind the counter as much). I think they've tweaked it since, but it essentially tastes like a salted and spiced mayo, so nothing super special about it. Wasabi mayo -- FANTASTIC. GET IT. NOW. Especially if you're a fan of the spicy. \u00a0*additional sauce update* Okay, I don't know if it's new but the Mexican Ketchup is to DIE for... I have an obsession with cilantro and jalapenos, and it's chopped cilantro + chopped jalapenos (both fresh!) + ketchup. Next time I will get it without the ketchup, but it is FANTASTIC.

Ordering is simple, just tell them what size and which sauces. Why? All they have are pomme frites (french fries). Their fries are wonderfully delicious. Definitely not your fast food or diner fries. They freshly fry them in front of you and season them with the right amount of salt. Its a wonderful production that happens before your very eyes. They have 26 sauces you can choose (but need to pay for) and a few free ones like ketchup and others. My brother recommended the sweet mango chutney mayo. So worth it! It had the right amount of sweetness but also a little spiciness! I don't want to give it a 5 star rating simply because I feel it is a bit over priced for french fries even in that area.

I live in Lille on the French/Belgian border and have made trips to Brussels and Bruges pretty often to have their tasty fries. These taste NOTHING like authentic Pommes Frites. In fact they taste like really good chips that you'd get in a British chippy. Mis-shapen, quite thick, pretty greasy but most of all tasty. Let me paint you a picture. You like beer. you open a bar selling only Belgian beer and you call 'American beer experience'. Yey, everyone loves the beer....but wheres the connection??

They allow you to sample any of their 20+ sauces, but we decided to just pick three at random and dig in. We settled on the parmesan garlic sauce, cheddar cheese sauce, and the sun dried tomato sauce. My biggest regret was the cheddar cheese sauce because it was exactly what one would expect--stadium style cheese sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but just nothing outside of the box. Our favorite was the Parmesan garlic, and the sun dried tomato sauce was also incredibly tasty. The fries were nothing special themselves, just small typical thick cut fries. This place is definitely about the sauce, and the fries provide a tasty vessel for shoveling the sauce to your face.The atmosphere is dirty and dingy with only a few tables and chairs by a skinny bar.

They come in these paper cones and the tables have holes in them for you to put it in. Pomegranate Teriyaki Mayo has just the right amount of sweet and salty. Parmesan Peppercorn has a nice kick to it as does the Wasabi Mayo (although I don't think I could finish the wasabi one). Sweet Mango Chutney is always a staple as well as Sundried Tomato. The Poutine is really good too (cheese and gravy with fries).

The decor isn't much but it's quaint and conveniently located near St. Mark's. I first visited this place with a friend & we got the garlic mayo sauce. It was very good and the fries were thick cut and crisp. They fry up the wedges of potatoes to order, so the fries don't get stale. We went on a Friday afternoon so there weren't that many people there, we sat down in the back of the place. There aren't many seats, and about two or three tables. But the tables are cute in that there are holes in the table that the pomme frites that come in paper cones will fit perfectly in there. Kind of a dingy atmosphere but almost everything is wood paneled, but gives it a kind of authentic feel.I just passed by this place last week and was tempted to get some, but for me, the serving sizes are way too big. If I were to get the small sized pomme frites, I would need to share with a friend. I got a small for just myself once, and I ate about half of it and I was full.

If they had come as a side dish I probably would have enjoyed them more, but as the focus of a restaurant/a meal they fall short. The shop is very small and isn't really the ideal place to stay. This definitely feels like a street food, grab-and-go kind of establishment. Thus, I was surprised to find that some of my fries were cooked to perfection, lightly seasoned and golden brown on the outside, and fluffy and soft on the inside. However, even the regular is kind of a large portion and I'd say about a good 25%-40% of those fries are of questionable quality. I did like the sweet mango chutney mayo that everyone is raving about but it didn't taste too much like mango or chutney. Really, I got a sweet, tangy, mayo.

I had asked for regular ketchup because that mayonnaise flavor lingered in my mouth from the samples and I needed it out.The sauces were okay. (period)The fries were just plain old fries!

But for a first timer, I felt lost. What's the difference between on the side and on the fries? And if you get more than one sauce, do they layer it both on the fries - on multiple layers? I just made it easier and got the sauce on the side - though it was more expensive than just getting it on the fries. The regular size is still huge. I thought it was one of those paper cones - turns out it was two put together. I think it feeds three (girls). How do people enjoy without sitting down at a table? We tried standing and eating it outside but it was messy. And they have like 3 tables inside. So lots of people got it to go. Where do you guys go to eat it? I assume it takes too long to subway back to wherever you came from and fries are best enjoyed hot. So this was more of a snack before dinner. The fires were hot - I saw them making it when I ordered. And so they felt really fresh and it wasn't too oily which I liked. It's in between the skinny and steak fries which is good. And just great potato taste. Stuck with the most popular sauces it seemed - the mango chutney mayo and the rosemary garlic mayo.

It's $1 per sauce, but you can get 3 sauces for $2.50 (my recommendation) -- ketchup, mustard, etc. are free. I highly recommend the wasabi mayo, sundried tomato mayo (MY FAVORITE), smoked eggplant mayo, and pomegranate teriyaki mayo. If you don't finish your mayo -- and there's a pretty good chance you won't because they give you so much -- I would definitely recommend taking it home with you. These sauces would be great with a sandwich or something else. It's cheap and delicious.

They stay open really late but on the weekends forget it don't bother because you got a lot of drunken people waiting for their fries.

Decided to give it a try. I ordered the small, which is actually a pretty big portion and can be shared. There were layers of fries, gravy, and cheese curds. The cheese curds were soft but held their form. A bit on the salty side for my tastes especially with the large about of gravy. I think the guy went a little gravy crazy and I actually had to scoop some out. The cheese in the middle actually melted a bit so there was a nice string cheesy effect. Overall, pretty good stuff but realized that I'm not big on have my fries covered in gravy or cheese because the crunch factor is gone. Will stick with regular fries and sauce!

I tried the other 3, only 1 of which I remember was honey mustard, they were all so-so. \u00a0I knew I \u00a0wanted hot crispy fries dipped only in that sweet succulent sauce, which had a bit of a spice and tang to it! I am a huge fan of dipping sauces and thiswas one of my all time favorites I have ever had. The fries were perfectly golden and crispy on the outside with a warm potato mush inside. I saved the big ones for my husband to eat as I picked through and devoured all the small crunchies, double dipping every single fry. The place is small and there was a line out the door, which isnt very long since it is so small. They had mellow music playing inside, and the 2 guys behind the counter had a very calming effect on me, as they seamlessy helped the customers. We scored the best table there which was right out side of the door. Anyways, the fries were awesome and that sauce..ohhhh that sauce!!!
