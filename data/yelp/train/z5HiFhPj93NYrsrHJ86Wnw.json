You come in, order and pay at the register, take a number, and then take your seat and wait for your delicious food. I ordered what seems Breakfast Klub is known for, their chicken and waffles. \u00a0Upon having this platter, I have to say that it was definitely on point. \u00a0The fried chicken was very crispy, just how I like it, and the waffles were a nice touch. \u00a0The strong flavor of the fried chicken complemented well with the fluffy waffle. \u00a0I also was able to try their sweet tea, which I definitely miss when I lived in the south before. \u00a0I could not get enough of this sugary tea! \u00a0Oh, and I also took a bite off the green eggs and ham, along with the catfish and grits. \u00a0Both were also tasty and I was especially impressed with the catfish, that was sooo good too!I would like to mention again how great the staff is here, they are a very likable crew. \u00a0I had that \"soulful\" vibe coming in here and overall the Breakfast Klub does it right!Just watch out for the very small parking lot though, you likely have to either park on the street or paid lot nearby (no worries, the paid parking lot is cheap).", "Date": "2014-07-10", "Author_Location": "Nutley, NJ"}, {"Author": "Felicia A.", "ReviewID": "R6wdCGGhNtptQ-6LA7z3bA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm going to throw out a controversial statement: I don't like waffles. Like at all. That being said, I have not tried the Breakfast Klub's Waffles and Wings combo. Still, I'm a fan of TBK's other breakfast offerings, particularly the Breakfast Special. Eggs, your choice of meat, breakfast potatoes or grits, and a biscuit or toast. Scrambled eggs, two hearty slices of fresh turkey, flavorful breakfast potatoes, and a buttery biscuit are where it's at. I've also been very pleased with the prepared coffee drinks I've ordered at TBK.Only downside is, of course, standing in line in the Houston humidity. The warm and welcoming staff helps. I also tend to feel rushed when I see a line of people waiting for a table. The staff at TBK don't add to that feeling, though; totally self-imposed! TBK is worth the wait.

No special spin on the traditional collards yams and etc just plain GOOD.  The customer service there is also a plus for me. It is always a down home vibe which is something I definitely can appreciate along with my southern homestyle cooking.

But, the line is soon forgotten once you sit down to enjoy the food; it is certainly worth it!If you like pancakes or french toast, I can suggest both; but, the pancakes are my favorite - EXCELLENT! The eggs are cooked to order and are always perfect. There are several coffee varieties so you can choose the strength of your choice (or mix them); and its bottomless cup. We haven't tried the catfish or grits, but I am told they are worth trying if either appeals to you.The food is absolutely delicious; however, finding parking, standing in line, finding/waiting for a table and then once you finish eating you can't linger over coffee and talk too long since they need you to leave because someone else is waiting for your table, and also that you have to serve yourself coffee and condiments, are the only reason I gave one of my favorite restaurants 4 stars rather than 5.

I love to venture out and try new places, especially southern brunch restaurants, therefore I was extremely excited about this recommendation. Me and my bestie decided to go early Sunday Morning, right when they open at 8:00AM. We left our hotel around 7:40ish AM to avoid a long line that wrapped around the building. Yes, this place is known for having people stand outside along the side of the building, just to indulge in some mouthwatering breakfast. Luckily we left early enough to arrive at The Breakfast Klub a little after 8:00AM, where we stood in very small line of about 10 people. We were greeted with menus, southern smiles, and awesome hospitality. A sweet little old lady, with a large personality gave us a welcoming hug and most importantly laid down the house rules. As soon as you walk in the restaurant you are directed to a register where you are able to place your own food and drink order. Next, you can pick up any additional condiments in the side pantry shelf, as well as make your own coffee. This process gave a really unique comfort feeling as if I was at my grandmother's house.I ordered the Fish and Grits, with a side of Cheese Eggs and a Homemade Biscuit. After doing my own personal Yelp research on the restaurant, I was well prepared on what I already wanted and these southern taste buds were craving the Fish and Grits. As soon as we took our seats, we received our food pretty quick, and it was steaming hot. The bestie had the 2 Fried Pork Chops, Eggs, Toast, and House Potatoes. Each presentation was nice; I really loved the multicolored plates and how my food wasn't sliding and gliding all over the place. We anxiously blessed our food in prayer, and straight dived right in. Literally... it was a moment of silence for both of us as we took multiple bites, it was absolutely amazing! Everything was well-cooked, well- seasoned, and well-prepared on our plates. Our experience was perfect, the service was excellent as the waiter constantly checked on us and even volunteered to take our picture.I will definitely make my way back to Houston just to relive this remarkable Breakfast Klub experience, but next time I'm ordering the Pork Chops! lol", "Date": "2014-06-09", "Author_Location": "Rowlett, TX"}, {"Author": "Zero C.", "ReviewID": "AjpbPuQwK0sb-EXcXI4oyA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "No doubt their Chicken wings, waffle, and grits were good.

The staff is always friendly. But, let's be honest - the food simply isn't that great!There are a couple items on the menu that are often OUTSTANDING - the grits and The French Toast. The waffle is also pretty good, but nothing really spectacular about it.I've had the wings a few different times and as someone pointed out, they are most likely going to include some feathers. Additionally, they're often re-dipped. That means they fry the chicken and have it sitting and then when an order is placed, the put it back in the hot grease to give the illusion that it was fried at the time you ordered it. You can tell this by the taste as well as the amount of grease you encounter.I've had the catfish with the grits a few times and it's almost ALWAYS too salty and possibly sometimes re-dipped as well.You're definitely bound to see stars when you go, depending on the day/time. Everyone from athletes to Jay-Z and Beyonce eat here. My friend and I were seated at a table next to an athlete and his entourage once and I'd never seen so much food left behind before. When I asked one of the guys why he didn't eat the food, he explained that he had once owned a restaurant and the way the food tasted wasn't top quality and then he went on to include some of the things I previously mentioned. We decided to box up all the leftovers and give it to the homeless.As others have mentioned, the hype is the smoke and mirrors.

The wait staff are extremely friendly and professional. An older woman hands out menus in line and explains the layout of the restaurant to streamline 'traffic flow.' The employees at the register are fast and efficient, but polite and helpful all the same. In the dining area, staff work diligently to direct people to open tables and clear up plates in a flash. You have to admire the ordered chaos at work. Basically, don't let this deter you from coming here.Still, I'm a little disappointed because I don't really see the hype. The Breakfast Klub has your typical breakfast food with a distinctly Southern twist; think waffles, pancakes, french toast, chicken wings, grits, bacon, ham, and the like. It's all very fluffy and rich, but at the same time, I'm not sure that it's worth $13-15 per plate or $4 for a cup of coffee for what is really pretty generic morning comfort food. I could get the same for less at any diner or chain breakfast place.

But here it goes: I don't like chicken and waffles. I love all things breakfast and all things chicken, but somehow I never like them together. The Breakfast Klub may very well change all of this for me, because the chicken and waffles I've sampled here are as delicious as folks have hyped it up to be. Mind blown? Just maybe.One big knock that should be noted right off the bat: They close at 2pm. Every day. Even if you're not a morning person (which I'm totally not), it's worth getting up to dine at one of Houston's most popular establishments. Another semi-knock: There is a line. Practically every day. Patience recommended.Their most ordered item, chicken and waffles aka the star of the show, is as delicious as advertised. Crunchy crust on the outside, yet soft on the inside, the waffle with a light touch of butter and maple syrup is delicious all on its own. Add to it a perfectly fried buttermilk chicken wing, juicy and succulent by itself, is a lethal combination of tastiness. It is indeed a shining achievement, they could easily just serve this and call it a day.Thankfully, the rest of the menu merits a further exploration. \u00a0One particular item, a sloppy concoction of biscuits and gravy, is as hearty as it looks. The gravy is seasoned wonderfully without too much chunk, but plenty of creamy goodness that complements the fluffy biscuit bread quite well. Add to that a couple of perfectly cooked, runny over easy eggs and now you've got a hell of a meal.The same could be said for the catfish and grits as well as the eggs benedict. Both are equally rich, fantastically hearty, and are must haves for a group of varied taste. Homefries and hashbrown lovers might be disappointed at subpar execution of both items, but folks don't come here for either. Don't sleep on the omelettes either, there is plenty to offer and even more to eat. Then there is the bacon. Dat bacon. Goodness.If you're able to get up early and you're willing to wait it out, do check out The Breakfast Klub.

Wait time. We came here on our day off for MLK day. Based on reviews, we chose to come around 10 am to be at the tail end of breakfast but still beat the lunch crowd. Good decision. The line was just about to go past the building, which means it's around a 30-45 minute wait. Not too bad considering. Time went by pretty quickly too. When we got in, the line was already well past the building and when we left at noon, same thing. Food. I wanted to get the famous wings and waffles but I also heard about getting it with French toast instead. Sooo my friend got the French toast and we exchanged some waffles and French toast. The waffle - 4 stars - it looks a bit smaller than other waffles, but it's actually a pretty heavy batter. I prefer your lighter waffles. The wings - 5 stars - super juicy and got a nice Cajunish batter but not heavy. and for some reason, the wings are bigger than their drumsticks. You get 3 of each. The French toast - 4 stars - delicious, and not too soaked? But nothing super special. Probably would get this over the waffle though next time. Service. Everyone there is super nice and sweet - to the lady who handed out menus while we waited in line, to the person who takes your order, to the guy who brings out your food. Once you order in line and find a table, your food comes outs almost immediately. Super fast!! There are also some people who come by to check up if you need anything and ask how you are enjoying your food. Since my friend and I are kinda slow eaters and were deep in discussion, we probably had someone come by and ask us if we needed anything at least 3 times. It was almost on the border of maybe we should hurry up - but there was still free tables around us. Other people must eat faster or just take it to go.

Mmm...Eric Decker. Anyway, I digress. We pulled up at around 11:00 AM and there was a line that wrapped around the building! I had been recommended by Houston natives to check this place out so our determination was strong and our stomachs were empty. After a 5 mile run, my stomach was especially aching for some good food. We waited about 20-30 minutes. Nicely enough, the weather was cool so our time was pleasantly spent talking and catching up. Once inside, we got down to business. The brother of mine ordered the classic waffles and chicken wings. I got the french toast and a side of grits, per Yelper recommendations. The guy at the register recommended the Columbian roast and we were on our way. We grabbed a table pretty quickly but I can see how seating is an absolute nightmare here, especially if you are a big party. The purveyors of fine fried foods try to accommodate as best they can so that's nice. It's a very familial like atmosphere with staffers coming around asking how people are doing and assisting where they can. I love that they care about the clientele. Now, I will say, this breakfast was a splurge. All said and done, two meals and two beverages and a side set us back about 45 bucks. Ordinarily, I'd say \"Ain't nobody got time for that!!\" but it was a treat and I hadn't seen big brother in a while. We got our food quickly enough, about 10 minutes later and proceeded to face plant. I will say, they have warm syrup, which is a nice touch so go getcha some.Food was stellar. They definitely know how to handle a fryer here. The chicken wings remained crispy and perfect throughout the meal despite my dredging that birdie up in honey. Seasoning was spot on, well flavored, and balanced. They're chicken wings....the best food on the planet I daresay? Mmm. Waffle was perfect. My brother smothers everything with maple syrup and butter a la Vince Vaughn circa Wedding Crashers (Just pop the lid off and top everything off, would ya?) so I didn't get to sample the virgin waffle but it was really, really good. They throw vanilla in the batter and it's really light and airy. French toast was bomb. Crispy in all the right places and soft and custard-y in all the other places. Not too sweet but really well made. Part of me was convinced that they just egg batter that puppy up and throw it on into the fryer as well. The scrambled eggs were also really well made for those of you discerning folk who are particular about your eggs. I could care less for the pan sausage. It has some sweet element within the patty which normally I go for but I was so distracted by...THE SIDE OF GRITS! If you go, get the grits. Yes, I get that it's 5 bucks and some change. It's exorbitant for something as simple and cheap like grits but it is DEEE-LICIOUS and worth every calorie in it. Keep in mind, it comes with a pool of melted butter in a divet within the pillowy cloud of cheese-d (request cheese) grits. So good. I could have just had the darn plate of grits and called it a day. My brother and I laid that plate to waste. Not to mention, it went GREAT with the eggs. Go. It's not an every day sort of thing but for a once every 4-6 months where you can really relish it and enjoy the richness adequately without feeling like a slovenly fed glutton.", "Date": "2013-12-28", "Author_Location": "Austin, TX"}, {"Author": "John V.", "ReviewID": "YD_rJBYIaGB77bgm1Su5pw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I no longer live in Houston and never tried this place so I made it a point to do so on a recent visit. \u00a0I met a friend there for breakfast. \u00a0The staff is super friendly and helpful. \u00a0They have a small lot that fills quickly so you might need to park a block or two away. \u00a0I had the wings and grits along with a giant cup of coffee. \u00a0The wings and grits were awesome. \u00a0There's just something really comforting about really good grits. \u00a0My friend got the catfish and it was very flavorful as well. \u00a0This place may be a bit pricey for breakfast, but it is a Houston institution and I'm really glad I got to experience it. \u00a0The next time I'm in Houston, I will be returning.Stay sexy fellow Yelpers!", "Date": "2014-01-10", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Alexander G.", "ReviewID": "KkS1vc_dv6O98GdNzmZH_Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I felt like it was feeding time for the cattle (= customers) - you get rushed through a long line and then get a spectacularly big plate of food - nothing less, nothing more.

I jumped at the chance, since we were still an hour away from being inside where it was cool. Okay, so I didn't solve the heat problem, but I was only a few minutes away from getting to try the chicken and waffles. Like I mentioned above...the chicken and waffles were expensive. And it wasn't so much chicken as it was wings. Like BWW wings. Drumette. Wing. That's it. Nothing special. No AHA moment. Just wings.The waffle (not waffles) was good. Fluffy yet dense. Filling. Satisfying. Just not savory (which is what the wings were supposed to provide). Nevertheless, it was good and made the perfect compliment to my breakfast.

After seeing all the hype on GMA as best breakfast in America we woke up early one Sunday morning and left our NW suburban area to let our taste buds judge this establishment.

Now don't be discouraged by this as the line moves well and you can get complimentary water while you wait and the sweet elder lady is very entertaining as she interacts with the crowd. Oh yea there are tents lined up to help with the sun but you really can't avoid the humidity in Houston, Ha!I ordered the catfish and grits and the wife opted for the wings and waffles. The catfish is seasoned to perfection and battered with a flaky deliciousness. The grits are smooth with the right amount of butter and salt along with the eggs and toast.

Chicken and waffles (duh) - These have to be some of the best chicken wings in Houston, definitely rival my favorite ones at Timmy Chan's. Be careful though, they come out hot! (I know you're practically starving from the long wait), so please blow on them or wait a little before digging in (trust me I have burned my tongue enough times than I am proud to say, so learn from my mistakes). Add a little bit of hot sauce on each bite, a bit of waffle, and all dipped in syrup, you can't get a much more perfect bite than that. 2. Catfish and grits - this dish is almost just as good as the chicken and waffles. I have never had a piece of catfish so perfectly fried.

I'm new to the Houston food scene, so of course I had to try it. Let me tell y'all, The Breakfast Club holds up to every compliment I've heard.My cousin and I went Friday, Nov. 15, during the lunch hour. The line was just heading out of the door, but our wait was no more than 10 minutes and the hostess was as welcoming as they get. Our food was ordered quickly, we found a seat and the service that followed was fabulous.The attendant ensured our cups never went empty and we didn't wait long at all for our food to come. I ordered the pork chops with grits and potatoes (I don't eat eggs or waffles), my cousin ordered the Katfish and grits, and we both ordered wings as an appetizer.OK, after we said Grace before eating, I said another prayer of thanks after I took a bite of the pork chop. That pork chop must have melted in my mouth. I'm not lying y'all. It was awesome. I come a from a family and literally a village that knows a pig from the roota to the toota, and I've never had fried pork chops like these (please don't tell my mother). Check out the pictures. They don't lie.My cousin assured me the Katfish was good and I believed her because not once did she open her mouth to talk while we were eating. I didn't eat my wings until today (Sunday) and I almost wish I hadn't \u00a0waited, they are so good. This place doesn't disappoint. Yeah, it gets packed. I heard the lines get ridiculous.

Total amount spent $25! Looking at the prices, like Frenchy's Chicken got to gouge prices for a predominant demographic area huh?-Chikin Wings ($8). Texture and taste was different from the CFC cutlet as expected b/c it is a different part of the chicken, just like the cow and pig. Seasoned and crispy as expected. How do you say a less greasy Timmy Chan's Wing version? Nothing remarkable. 2.5/5-Chikin fried chikin, green beans, mashed potatoes with homemade gravy and texas toast ($15 Lunch Special). Breaded, fattening, and using their handmade flour/seasoning mix. Slight crisp, scourging hot, but bland. It did not have that robust \"i must have second's\" taste and feel. 2.5/5-Green beans with onions and i believe bits of bacon was tasteful, moist, and seasoned like grandma's southern casserole , definitely not bland. 3.5/5-Mashed potatoes/gravy- Nothing to go bonkers over. Buttery and seasoned, not well memorable.1.5/5-Texas Toast- Enriched white Texas size with butter, again same taste, nothing spectacular. 1/5Customer Service- solid 4/5 stars for a establishment that is not a St. Regis experience, nor Pappas Bros. white table dinner atmosphere. Staff are friendly and very accommodating. Although they concentrate on just a bit of southern cuisine, but not a variety across the picnic table. I've lived in Houston since the early 80's and i can not understand how this restaurant has a line of wait around the block. Maybe from a marketing perspective its a good idea since it is small place perhaps that is why. But hey, they're making money so no hate from me. There are other places that are better like Roscoe's house of Chicken/Waffles in New York. Overall, i give Breakfast Klub a little over 2/5 stars. Note i did not have breakfast so i had just water, fasting through the morning prior to arriving at BK. Also, the place is self seated, self drink of choice, silverware, and condiments.

I love both dishes so much, it's hard for me to not to order at least one dish everytime I'm here. Usually my friend orders one and I order the other, so I practically get to enjoy both at the same time! Both plates are large enough to be split. Whoever can finish the whole plate by themselves, sir/mam, you are a breakfast trooper. But personally, I love the fact I can save some for later.Not sure what kind of magical ingredients they put in that chicken recipe, but one bite into it and you're like, \"it's good to be home.\" As for the catfish and grits.. well there's some kind of voodoo in that plate as well! I once thought I was allergic to catfish, but I think The Breakfast Klub cured it. Haha I probably wasn't allergic to begin with, and thank goodness because it's hard to resist myself when it comes to their catfish. I must warn you, the grits that comes with the plate is not the most healthiest thing. Let's face it, there's no nutritional value in it period, especially when theres a little pool of butter sitting right in the center of it. It gets cold quickly and clumps up fast... but I still gobble it all up! Butter makes everything better. Okay, okay, so everything sounds great right!? Well with good food, comes much traffic. If you come by at 11-12, be prepared to wait in a line that winds to the parking lot. Sounds scary right? Well the table turnover is pretty fast so it's not as bad as it looks.

The problem with the dish was the waffle. \u00a0It honestly was no different than the ones you would get at a denny's or cheap diner. \u00a0It was soggy, not crisp as it should be. \u00a0The batter itself had no remarkable flavor. \u00a0It was your average run of the mill waffle, so It deserves an average 3/5 rating. \u00a0We also got the green eggs and ham breakfast plate. \u00a0The best part of the dish was the biscuit. \u00a0It was was moist, buttery, and had a great flaky consistency. \u00a0A very solid effort, 4/5 The eggs were cooked \u00a0spinach, peppers, and chives. I thought for sure that this would make them more flavorful, but sadly it didn't really deliver. \u00a0I thought the eggs were only slightly better than you would find at a cheap diner. I expect more out of a $14 dish. \u00a03.25The grits were also a bit of a disappointment. \u00a0There consistency was all off. \u00a0Instead of a nice creamy texture they were grainy. \u00a0The flavor was a little off too. \u00a0They attempted to cover this up by dousing it with butter, but even that was unable to save the dish. \u00a03/5By far the weakest part of the meal was the ham. \u00a0I am really hit or miss with ham. \u00a0If it is high quality, cooked well, with appropriate spices I really love it. \u00a0If not, it is one of my most hated meats. \u00a0This was not high quality and really should not be served with a $14 dollar breakfast. \u00a01/5The coffee situation was another high note. \u00a0They have a decent number of selections and the ones we sampled were high quality. \u00a0The refills are also easy to get. \u00a0As for the soda, I think it's a little ridiculous to charge over $3 for a fountain soda that you refill yourself. This really was a very difficult place to rate. \u00a0The chicken wings and the biscuits were really tasty while the ham was terrible. \u00a0In between there was a lot of mediocrity. \u00a0The prices are high for breakfast, but I am 100% willing to pay them if the food is great. \u00a0Unfortunately I didn't feel this way as I left the restaurant. \u00a0I know I will be back at some point and try a few different items off the menu.

I really did but it was just okay.Pros: I ordered the chicken and waffles (switched the waffles for french toast) and the texture of the chicken was perfect. It was juicy and tender. As for customer service, the employees were very courteous and helpful. They were also very HAPPY. That may be weird to say but I've been to places where you could tell that the servers there did not like their job at all. The employees worked well with another like they were one large family. And they seemed genuinely concerned if you enjoyed your meal or not.Cons: I've had better fried chicken. I wanted to try the signature dish because I love southern fried chicken and had really high hopes for this dish. Sadly, I was disappointed. It was lacking in flavor. Yes the texture was perfect but the flavor makes up for most of a dish. I tried eating it with some hot sauce but it was still just okay. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffle looked kind of weird; the color was very pale. Another friend ordered the catfish with grits. The catfish was good but it was too dry for me. Check out my photo for Screen Door in Portland, Oregon. When I said that I have had better chicken, this is the place that I am referring to. The fried chicken was amazing and also looks more appetizing than the fried chicken pictures from The Breakfast Klub. yelp.com/biz_photos/scre\u2026 Final Verdict: The line is really long and despite it being one of the most popular places in town, I don't think its worth it.

Very Greasy, but good. I had the chicken and waffles (a first ever experience for me). The chicken was a special kind of greatness and it's pretty tough not to have success with a waffle. I also had a caramel latte, which I wasn't in love with because it was WAY too sweet. My teeth hurt as I'm typing this just thinking about it. We had passed this establishment numerous times and wanted to try it. Many times we were set to go but saw the line out the door and ended up changing our plans. This went on for two and a half years until finally one day I was off work on a weekday and up early for an appointment with time to spare. Parking even on a weekday was kind of a pain because we had to park two blocks away. There was not a line outside, but there was still a wait on the inside to order. While we were waiting, we were told how the restaurant works by a very vocal employee (which she had to be to overcome the blaring music). She was nice, I just have a problem with being told how to navigate their unique business model early in the morning while hungry, lacking caffeine and being bombarded with ridiculously loud gospel music. We figured out what we wanted and proceeded up to the cashier to order. For two of us, the total ended up being $45 for chicken & waffle, a croissant sandwich a latte, an iced tea and a coffee. We were a little shocked (especially for walk up service) but we figured we were paying for what we assumed to be the greatest meal known to man. After paying, we crossed the major traffic hub in the restaurant into a corner to get our beverages. I think each of us got run into by employees and patrons at least three times. Not once did either of us get an apology or a \"pardon me\". Annoyed, we brushed it off as a popular place and the breakfast rush. Once we sat down, it took about ten minutes until our food arrived. As stated earlier, the food was good. If I could get just the chicken, I totally would.All in all, we just weren't impressed with The Breakfast Klub.

We got both to see what the hype was all about, especially for the chicken and waffles. The dishes were a bit pricey at about $15 a plate, so make sure you brought a partner for sharing. The wings were very moist with the right amount of breading. The seasoning fell a little short for me though, since I like to eat them alone or with a little bit of ketchup, without the syrup. The waffles were my favorite part. These are the best waffles I've had so far. The warm syrup melted the butter onto the waffle and had me begging for more after each bite. \u00a0Truth be told, I ended up eating way more waffle than chicken when I shared the dish. \u00a0For the catfish, it would've taken a miracle to impress me, since I've had some of the best catfish in New Orleans.

Omg, the wings and waffle are to die for! I'm usually a pretty tough critic when it comes to fried chicken because I tend to find that many places make their chicken too oily and/or flavorless, but this chicken was absolute perfection! It was not too oily, and the chicken was seasoned just enough to give it great flavor without being too overpowering. The waffle was nice and fluffy. It was a great complement to the chicken.The service is wonderful! The whole staff is so friendly and welcoming. They genuinely care if you are enjoying your experience there. They are also very quick. After ordering my food, I don't think I waited more than 10 minutes for it to arrive at my table. The atmosphere is also great. It is a very relaxed, casual place.

Be patient and be part of the beginning of the line now. That way, you'll be done early, around 9a. Otherwise, don't bother, as you'll be waiting for hours outside, bearing the brute force of buffoonery betwixt with a bum belly.By the way, free church music blasts out and about the business' speakers. This brought me back to my young blood days as a boy attending sermons at Black Baptist Churches. So, now I've been to service, and am about to be served, all by 8am.So, I was blessed with two birds and one big ass boulder! Boyyy stoppp!Once inside, ignore the hustle and bustle of the staff, as it's very busy. Instead, befriend them and reap the benefits of their benevolent and benign behavior, beginning with your order at the register. So, you're the beneficiary of the bill being payed first.Although they cover a broad spectrum of breakfast and brunch bites, the bulletin of beloved items are listed below:*Katfish and Grits w/Eggs & Biskit*Wings and WafflesNow, I normally bore of this type of food since I was born and bred on it (i.e. I'm burned out on it). But, I had to behold the big-hearted flavor of the first bite of catfish! I'm just saying, I had no bacon, but this breakfast does go H.A.M. (Hard As a Mutha...)!Breathe, just breathe...The beauty of the fried catfish was eating it bare. It's so well seasoned that no dipping sauce was required. The buttery grits were the best I've ever had--bar none! The \"biskit\" was baked well, but needed a little gravy on its back end. Eggs were basically bland, but you'll season them to your liking.They easily meet, beat, or exceed their brothers for breakfast competition in terms of quality and quantity--IHOP, Waffle House, Pancake House, etc. The Breakfast Klub is a little expensive, but offer big portions and value, so they're better overall. Heck, I'll bodaciously throw my ballot in and say they win.Complaints and/or suggestions? Water boiling too hot for a brew of tea--I had to take it to go *and* add ice cubes. Maybe smaller/cheaper \"lite\" portions that aren't too big for my britches (6 wings *and* a waffle is a lot of food), but that's about it. Then again, there's \"A La Karte\", so problem solved.Be that as it may, there's a reason places like this become cultural icons, dining recommendations, and/or city spot phenomenons. So, don't be the boob or black sheep who's never been to The Breakfast Klub in the H.If you have country folks in The Fam or The Crew, this is a must try.", "Date": "2013-04-20", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Shabreka W.", "ReviewID": "WG2dDkqc9eWIUzisCzOw0g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Food is always hot and delicious.

It was served with two biscuits and runny white gravy with small chopped pieces of some time of sausage (not the crumbled sausage you might initially expect). I ate one half of a biscuit and couldn't eat any more. The saltiness really overwhelmed everything and ruined the dish.My wife ordered the wings and waffles \u00a0($13-15, I don't remember exactly) since we've both heard good things about it. The waffle was unremarkable and the chicken, although perfectly crispy and juicy, also suffered from the same heavy handed saltiness. The breading had a tiny bit of heat, which was awesome, but it was barely noticeable over the salt.All that being said, I didn't opt to send either plate back even though two people did come by to see how our food was. I was put off by the food and didn't feel like dealing with the headache and awkwardness of sending food back. I wasn't expecting gourmet breakfast by any means, but I was really let down by the food quality.I'm glad we came on a weekday and avoided the serpentine line they normally have on weekends.

I needed to write this while the memories were fresh. This is unquestionably the best brunch I've ever had, taking into account the trendy, the down-home and the standard New American brunches that I've sampled all over the country. In terms of service, crowd control, quality, value and the added bonus of changing the way I view certain dishes, The Breakfast Klub has everywhere else beat.We assumed that since the weather was grey and cold by Houston standards, we would have a reduced wait time. That may have been accurate as we arrived shortly before 11 and had to wait just 25 minutes. Still, it doesn't look like even wintry weather keeps folks away from The Breakfast Club so be prepared to wait, rain or shine. The experience of waiting is really not arduous if you come before 11 AM, keep your party to a maximum of 3 and remain mindful that there is absolutely a valid reason why people are waiting in a long line-and this place STILL has 4.5 stars after almost 700 reviews. There is delicious free coffee with all the fixings while you wait and they really are extremely efficient once you step inside. We knew what we wanted almost right away so we didn't waste too much time hemming and hawing at the counter.What impressed us was how orderly everything was in spite of the huge lines. Once indoors, \u00a0it was efficient without feeling rushed. It seemed as if they had planned very well for crowds down to the small details, such as handing menus out regularly to new patrons in line, informing them about how the ordering and seating worked and clearing and cleaning tables as soon as customers stood up to leave. Finally, the food...OH MY GOD. The wings and waffle were perfect together. I could have had either by itself and been in awe. Together, they were magic. Imagine a perfectly sweet, buttery waffle that needs no syrup and wings that were made with a crispy, savory batter that had to be spiced with divine inspiration.Even more impressive than the wings were the \"biskuits and gravy\" (they love their k's here). I categorically like biscuits and gravy but have stopped expecting much beyond a fat+carbs fix due to how mediocre their preparation is at most places. WHOA. This dish was revelatory. The biskuits were so flaky and tender that the edges were crisp due to their flakiness. The gravy was so rich and well-seasoned that I could have eaten a bowl of it alone and that would have been a fine brunch.We finally got the grits and fried \"poke\" chops on the side. I never mind grits but I generally dislike pork. Not only was I spooning grits into my mouth while ravenously eating wings and waffle but I actually took the leftover grits to go for the next day. These grits were that special. The fried pork chop is what sealed the five-star review, however.I hate pork usually. I was ripping this chop apart, however. It was fried in a batter similar to the wings and was juicy and flavorful on the inside. The Breakfast Klub opened my eyes to the possibility of pork. That's what she said.I'm done gushing. I would wait in line again and again and again for this. Service is lovely and warm and the atmosphere evokes the best of the south.

Honestly, we had made a wrong turn but decided to navigate to BK on a whim. Best. Mistake. Ever. As we waited in the line that extended out the door, which was short and moved quickly, I was struck by the super friendly and I mean genuinely friendly-- not \"I want a big tip\" friendly. They offered water, asked how we were, and tried their best to shuffle us into the restaurant as quickly as possible so we could get a nice whiff of AC. While standing in line, my breakfast date and I made our plan of attack. Clearly we were getting the wings and waffle but what else to order?? We finally settled on the catfish and grits because clearly everyone should have fried fish before 10AM everyone once in a while, right? ;)While we were waiting in line, I looked around and saw several people taking pictures of their colorful plates before digging in and others posting their pictures on Instagram. The two ladies ahead of us in line even asked the cashier if they could take a picture of him with the kitchen in the backdrop. At this point, I honestly hadn't realized that The Breakfast Klub was truly a Houston icon. Shame on me for taking so long to make it out here!Another thing that surprised me was how quickly the food came out. In the time that it took for me wash my hands and to pick my coffee (Disclaimer: there are a lot of choices...only a slightly bad thing if you're indecisive like me) the food was on the table and piping hot. The catfish and grits were good, but we decided that we're not really grit...ty kind of people. The texture just wasn't cutting it for us. However, the catfish was nicely seasoned and crispy as could be. The wings and waffle plate was amazing. The chicken was just so crispy and since the wings and waffle are basically what BK is known for, I'm glad it didn't disappoint. In addition to the mediocre grits, however, the waffle that the wings were served with was also subpar. It was dry and didn't have the same crispy exterior that fresh waffles that come out of the waffle maker typically have.

Chicken & Waffles was $14.99. However, the portion size was pretty big.First thought after taking the bite: The chicken was so tender and perfectly seasoned.

Deep fried is usually just deep fried, hiding weird tastes or masking utter blandness. But Breakfast Klub deep fried chicken wings and deep friend catfish is really something else. Indeed, the best fried fish of any kind that I've ever tasted. The catfish has a strong flavor, and the batter does not hide a thing.

The management came from the Vatican and the staff was local.Mary came over and stood with me at the counter while I ordered a 6 piece chicken wings a la carte and a side of their \"to die for\" grits. I heard the cheese Nazi whisper, \"No cheese for you\". This was more than enough food for a breakfast. When I was done paying, Mary and I moved over to one side and had our picture taken.

Seriously, people. You want to complain about a measly 15-20 minute wait? Think about this: By the time you get in line that so happens to wrap around the building, are handed a menu and order, get chatted by the friendly staff, entertained by outside vendors with booths (even activities for the kiddies), pay at the register, grab your delicious hot coffee and then sit down ... your food appears on your table right before your eyes.

We only had to wait about 15 mins in line which is odd because you're waiting to order your food at the counter. How hard can that be? \"I'll take the Chicken and Waffles\". Then pay your money and move on. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles just because that was their specialty and I've never had this combination. I've heard of people eating fried chicken and waffles for breakfast and raved about it even though I think it's a bit odd. I think it's an excuse to eat fried chicken in the morning. \"Hmm, I really want fried chicken this morning but I should have breakfast. I know, I'll add a waffle and call it breakfast...done and done\". We also split the biscuits and gravy which were as expected...amazing. The biscuits were huge and the gravy had nice chunks of sausage in it...best I've ever had. After our meal, I felt bad because we had so much food left over and we were sitting under a picture that had 2 little homeless looking kids holding up a sign that said, \"Will Vote For Food\". Sorry kiddies, but we're tossing all this food in the trash and not your bellies. I felt bad for a min though. This place gives the largest portions and is definitely a factor in Houston being one of the fattest cities in America. Besides the food being amazing, another reason to come here is because the staff is incredible. I can't think of any restaurant I've been to where I've felt so welcomed. The owner was going around and talking to everyone in line as well as a greater going outside on a regular basis to welcome everyone and see how they were doing.

While waiting, the staff will direct you on how to order, where to get your drinks and condiments, and they even have water outside to help with this Texas heat as you wait. I had been wanting to go see what all the fuss was about and was able to get my sister and niece to tag along. We arrived around 9:30 and only waited about 15 minutes before we were able to place our orders and find a table. The place is decent sized for the location, but the tables felt like they were covered in syrup. I mean, I know it's a known for Chicken 'n Waffles, but I don't want to wear it home on my clothes. After cash register shock at the price of breakfast for 3 people - $40, I settled in to my chair with a nice hot cup of Colombian coffee as we waited for our orders. In just minutes the plates arrived and my Chicken 'n Waffles smelt delicious. I immediately dug in and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the wings. They were tasty with a slight kick of spice, and not overdone. The Belgian waffle was fluffy with a nice crisp to the edges but a little heavy for me. I wasn't able to eat much mostly because I don't eat big breakfasts usually, but I did take the wings to go. The next day they actually tasted better cold and fresh out of the fridge. They seemed a little spicier on day 2.

I couldn't breathe and my eyes were tearing up because of how I stuffed my face but I would do it all over again if I had the company because it was just so chicken-lickin' good.You may have noted that there is a really long line out the door of this place, but the line moves really quickly and their good hospitality starts from the outside-in. There is water and coffee you can have while cruising through the line and employees are always there handing out menus and assisting with any recommendations.In no time my guest and I were inside ordering our food and we definitely indulged ourselves:- Wings & Waffles: Juiciest, most delicious wings I have ever had. These babies were perfection. Crispy crunch on the outside, not too much batter, amazing flavor and juice on the inside. The kind of juice that dribbles down your chin because it's so good. The waffles were pretty good. I've never been a waffle girl so I'm not really one to judge.- Biskits & Gravy: My heart aches just thinking about the biscuits and gravy. I could drink that gravy straight, therefore how appropriate is it that they serve it in a cappuccino cup. The biscuits were fluffy, flaky, and the perfect vehicle to get all that flavorful gravy from plate to mouth. Screw coffee. Get gravy.- Pankakes w/ 2 Eggs, Sausage, Bakon, and Ham: The pancakes were seriously tasty and also fluffy. I don't remember the sausage very much, but the bacon was exactly how I like it: crispy, but not too crispy and the fat was perfectly crisped to where it melted in my mouth. The ham was very nice too, not like the crap you'd get at Denny's.The service was speedy and just the epitome of southern hospitality. The sinfully delicious food is worth waiting two hours for, but luckily it only took about 5-10 minutes, the same amount of time I would have waited at any sit-down restaurant.

The girlfriend volunteered at a clinic in midtown last summer, and has since been raving about this place that hates the letter C. We've tried to go a few times before, but were deterred by the line, as we had things to do after brunch/lunch. For my birthday this year, the girlfriend asked what I wanted to do for dinner. Screw dinner, I said! We're eating breakfast! (full disclosure: Like Chris Turk, I'm a brinner's #1 fan. But getting up for breakfast...not so much.)So on Super Bowl Sunday, to the Breakfast Klub we went. I thought we were beating the church crowd getting there at 10:30--no luck there. Saints fans were on the prowl, though, even setting up shop with some Who Dat? shirts in front. The order taker/menu lady (not really sure what else to call her) came out shouting \"Are there any Saints fans here?!\" A couple woo hoo's went out. She countered that by saying \"Go New England!\" Now she could have been A) being facetious and pointing out Indy's archrival, B) completely clueless about who was playing, or C) a Tom Brady fan. Whatever option you believe, the point is that friendliness is key at the Klub.The wait, while daunting, isn't bad. Upon entry, your order is written on a slip. Wait a little bit more (read the literature on the wall, perhaps), and you hand your slip over to the cashier, who (naturally) greets you with a smile. \u00a0We went with the two favorites: catfish and grits and chicken and waffles. \u00a0I picked up a bottomless cup of gourmet coffee, which is one of the best cups of joe I've had this side of Starbucks. I sampled a few, but settled on the Guatemalen blend as my fave. \u00a0They also have a variety of specialty-chinos, but like the Denny's guy, I like mine straight black, thanks. \u00a0They also offer store-bought juices or homemade tea or lemonade.I hadn't even finished picking up utensils, condiments, and my first coffee, and the food was already at the table. So yeah, it's the same wait as going to IHOP, only you wait standing up instead of sitting down. Again, no worries about the line, folks.The catfish was one of the best I've ever had. It's crunchy on the outside, flaky in the intermediate, and juicy on the inside--all with an explosion of flavor. The grits, which the girlfriend and I are no big fan of, was decently butter-y and delicious after a touch of salt, pepper, and tabasco. \u00a0Add some jelly to the biscuit and you've got yourself a meal. If you want great food, the catfish will do it for you.If you want the piece de resistance, then the chicken and waffles is really the only way to go. \u00a0Six wings, fried to perfection. \u00a0I've had myself some good wings: bonchon, karaage, Plucker's lemon pepper, spicy Popeye's, homemade...but this may top them all. Pour some syrup over the moist, oversized waffle and wings, stick a fork in it, and enjoy. I'm drooling again just thinking about it.As I ate, a big dude clasped his hand strongly on my shoulder. Startled, I almost dropped my fork. Never fear, dear readers, that's only the owner stopping by to say hello and thanks and how is the food. Great, I say. She gonna save you a bite of her wings?, he says. I hope so!, I say. He gives a hearty laugh and is on his way.The only downside of this place is the prices seem high for the food portions, but just think that you're paying for a hearty meal and a place where friendliness permeates.

Why on earth would you have fried chicken with Belgian waffles? And how the hell is powdered sugar supposed to factor into all this? But then I realized that I've eaten MUCH more atrocious things from food carts at the Houston Rodeo, and suddenly everything made sense. The savory, crispy, perfectly seasoned, deep-fried chicken wings are the perfect pairing to the sweet, light, and fluffy mattress of of a Belgian waffle that they sit upon. It's called contrast, and it's used in the best ways possible...contrast in flavors, contrast in textures...contrast = delicious.Or in simpler terms: OMG FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES SO GOOD NOM NOM.

The hostess is incredibly nice. How she keeps her energy and smiles through the long line of customers, I don't know. But I wanted to hug her.

A server found me carrying my little numbered flag while still making my way to a table. Which is good, I suppose, if you're in a hurry, but forfeits quality in my opinion. I ordered the signature Wings 'n Waffles with sides of bacon and cheese grits (to get a more complete picture), and the second in my party of two got the Breakfast Special, with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and a biscuit.The waffle was good, though I suppose hard to mess up, and the wings were crispy and flavorful, if a little greasy. The bacon was bacon. The famous grits, to which I added the coup de gr\u00e2ce of cheese, were buttery and rich, but not all that creamy. Rather, they were soft on the inside but firmer on the outside. In the end, every item betrayed its ability to be brought out almost immediately upon ordering: heat lamps and steam tables. Again, this is obviously a function of the huge crowds that show up for breakfast, but it doesn't have me counting the days until my next visit.I think the main draw of the Breakfast Klub is its atmosphere.

The meaty omelette was massive and served with buttered grits and a biscuit. Truly a breakfast best fit for a king (or queen). We eagerly ate off each others plate and still went home with leftovers!

I normally despise these at most places being as they usually come out tasting like artificial flavored hot water and sugar. These were not the case at all.

For those with short attention spans: IT'S GREAT. GO THERE ASAP.Now for more detail...My wife and I -- after reading the reviews here and at other places -- decided to visit on a weekday morning to avoid the weekend crowd for our first-time here. As we approached the door, a wonderfully friendly and outspoken lady heartily welcomed us to The Breakfast Klub, gave us menus, and told us the ropes:1. You order there.2. Your silverware and condiments are over there.3. That's your coffee, and it goes from stronger to weaker, left to right.4. Find you seat after you order, and they'll bring you your food.5. Enjoy yourself!That was it! When it was our turn to order, I asked the woman at the register what she'd recommend since it was our first time, and she told me to go ahead and get the \"Wings and Waffles\" since that's what they're best know for. Following her wisdom, my wife and I did just that -- me getting an Endless Cup of Coffee, and my wife getting a fountain drink.Finding a table wasn't hard as it wasn't incredibly busy, so we settled in -- then I went and grabbed our gear for eating. Having that \"newbie\" look on my face, the employees were quick to point me in the right direction and make sure I had what I needed.When I got back to the table just a minute or so after leaving, our food was being delivered. I heard they were fast, but THAT fast? Yes, they *are* that fast.So how was it? HEAVENLY. The wings -- which are really wings and drumsticks -- were perfectly seasoned, crisp, and cooked to perfection. The waffle was plate-sized, light, fluffy, and tasted wonderful. There was absolutely nothing wrong, nothing I could complain about, and nothing I could nitpick. That's a Good Thing.Without a doubt, we were blown away on our first visit -- and the same holds true for our subsequent visits. Every time we go to The Breakfast Klub, we have GREAT, consistent food (the Katfish and Grits is highly recommended, as well).Almost more important, though, is the atmosphere. One of the main reasons I love The Breakfast Klub so much are the people that work there. Every interaction I've had with the dozens of staff working has been great -- even when we go in \"rush-hour/wait along the side of the building because it'll be a while\" days. Everyone is welcoming and ready to help you out. Over the top customer service. You feel like you're visiting a good friend's Mom's (or Grandmom's) house, and you almost expect someone to give you a hug and pinch your cheek when you walk in.I cannot recommend The Breakfast Klub highly enough. Don't be afraid to go on a busy day, because the line you see wrapped around the side of the building moves really fast -- and it will be worth every second of the few minutes you'll be out there, I promise. Parking can be a hassle, but there's a lot right across the street (it's honor-system $1/$3 weekday/weekend).GO THERE.

The fried chicken was superb too. Not the typical oily stuff you get from KFC or Popeyes. It's oily, but something about it is different. SERVICE:Started getting greeted while waiting in line. Took me by surprise, but I was really impressed. The waitresses also always came to our table often to see if we needed anything else.HOW IT WORKS:You stand in line and order at the front before you sit down. Once you order, you'll get a number. Then you pick any table, put your number there, and food will be served to you literally two minutes after you sit down. So fast!PARKING: They have very few spots in front of the restaurant, but there's a large parking lot across the street. You can also find street parking.**Tip: We came at 11am on a Wednesday, and waited probably around 15 minutes (which I heard is not bad considering people waited 1-2 hours before).

In everything - presentation, menu, taste, quality. Fried chicken was tasty, and not just the skin but the meat was well seasoned as well. Waffles were still hot and crispy, just the way I like 'em. The catfish n' grits were a hit. Very well-seasoned fried catfish beautifully cooked, not overdone. Haven't tried the whole menu (yet), but the other items sound and look delicious as well. Staff is super friendly and down-homey. Very comfortable setting inside, kinda like Grandma's house on Sundays. Except in the middle of downtown Houston.

The potatoes were cooked perfectly, however a little too much pepper, I just put lots of ketchup and Tabasco to help. All over nice staff, quick service really good food, a little pricy, coffee would have been more expensive than Starbucks if I ordered one. We went here since the crowne hotel was $15 pp but it ended up paying the same amount here that we would have at the breakfast buffet.

Unfortunately I'm not one of them - as I judge more the individual dishes rather than the neat Southern combos - wings & pancakes, etc. As far as pancakes, eggs, and the routine fare, it is good, but it's definitely not the best place to get breakfast in H-town.To order, you get in a line that goes straight out to the door (the counter isn't far from the door anyways). And you order at the counter, sit down, and the meal is served to you. They have nice seating arrangements and you should feel comfortable although it may be noisy at times due to the lack of carpeting or whatever else.Overall, I give this place 4 stars due to its unique concept, mom-and-pop status, and it being a Houston institution. But if you're really hankering for a great breakfast without caring for a Southern taste, I recommend going elsewhere.

Now, only if there were similar places in the vicinity offering decent quality breakfast, there is a chance that huge line at BK would get evenly distributed and lead to short waiting times as people would get more options that are equally good.** And sorry to break this but: Klub's Benedict at BK are not good.. it is just a soggy mess with overflowing hollandaise sauce.. and regarding chicken and waffles - well, just another hyped up thing..", "Date": "2012-07-16", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Catina C.", "ReviewID": "ADtnHVrhCix9REojUrs8VQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had read reviews for this restaurant on another site.

She teased, joked, and had us laughing to the front door. My date had on a Dallas Cowboys shirt and she teased him about not being served.She explained the simple process to order. Upon entry, you can check out the owner's story and numerous awards that the restaurant has earned.The cashier that took our order was sweet and gracious. I put a tip in the jar and she came out later to find me, thank me, and gave me a hug.

I instantly fell in love with the decor and ambiance, with no particular style to speak of other than what I call a \"speak-easy\" vibe, the jazzy tunes playing in the background blended easily with the constant buzz of chatter from the other restaurant guests without being too chaotic. There were families, couples, business professionals, a book klub group, just a whole lot of random people but everyone seemed to be having a good time. The staff was all really nice and everyone I passed smiled and said hello. Our order started to arrive at our table nearly at the same time I sat down. I had the chicken and grits plate and will probably order this everytime I go back. My husband ordered the chicken and waffle plate with a side of cheesy eggs and potatoes. He couldn't finish but he gave it a good try. Kind of sad the orange juice was bottled and not a fresh squeezed concoction but the Kosta Rikan koffee was divine and I adored the large koffee mug they give you.

Based on another yelp review, they said to park at the first parking lot on the right after you make a right onto Alabama St. from Main St, but i'm going to correct that. That parking lot turns out to be a \"valet parking lot\" even though its clearly a public lot. So, keep going straight after you've made a right turn onto Alabama St. from Main St. and park in the lot on the corner of Alabama St. and Travis St. The parking lot is right in front entrance of the breakfast klub. Or, if you can't find parking in this lot since its really small, park in the public parking lot across Alabama St. It's $1, which you slide into a small slot of a metal cabinet, talk about ghetto or outdated!

Waffles are okay by themselves, it's not crispy, but not soggy. But they go really well with the wings and syrup. If the waffles were crispy, then I think they would overpower the clean crispiness of the fried chicken so I didn't mind that the waffle wasn't crispy.

The line was OUTSIDE, and WRAPPED around the side of the restaurant. Always a good sign. Ordered up french toast, scrambled eggs, pan fried sausage, and a hot coffee. Others at the table got fried chicken & waffles, and grits.The french toast, as mentioned before, caramelized perfectly. Sweet, soft, melting in the mouth, but not OVERLY sugary. Drizzle a little bit of the warm syrup they offer, and a bit of the butter and it literally is PERFECT. The pan fried sausage is delicious. Not too greasy, seasoned nicely, and just delicious. Like your favorite breakfast sausage only you don't feel like a heart attack after. Maybe its lean meat? Maybe its turkey sausage. Never found out.Eggs, pretty good. Coffee, pretty good. Everything was really really good. Everyone at the table like the chicken & waffles, especially the waffles. I'm not used to wings served with waffles (the Roscoe's and Lo-Lo's versions are usually breast/leg/wing combinations), but it works well because you can really have a fun meal with it. The grits were good, not great - probably something to do with the fact that the grits are coarsely cut, reminding me of instant grits. I like the watery fine grits with a ton of butter.Overall, this place is solid solid food. \u00a0The prices are great, the service is quick, self serving condiments and coffee is fun, and the food is delicious.

In the past, I've also had the fried fish and chicken fried steak. All were very good and came out piping hot. The place is a bit expensive. I think the bottled tea (homemade) is $3ish. The other dishes were $10+. The customer service here is excellent. The people here are nice and accommodating and the establishment is clean. Once you get through the line and pay for your order, you can always find a table.

Neither attribute is present on the menu.After looking at the outrageously large portions that every other diner had on their table, I went with a simple order of biscuits and gravy. On the menu, a side of dang gravy runs near $4!!! So, I thought it appropriate to just save the hassle of 1 biscuit+1 gravy for about $6 and order a double (full order) for $7.It was outrageous. The gravy was as rich as a corn chowder, as salty as a chicken fried steak, and the biscuits just screamed butter. I practically seeped butter out of my pores after the meal here. The biscuit texture and flavor were indistinguishable in the pool of sausage gravy. The sausage also offered a nice spice; I wish I knew what kind they used. It was link sausage, but I don't mind. Traditional breakfast sausage does not HAVE to be the norm, especially with the amazingly dark yellow (first time I have had this color!) sauce of joy.Breakfast Klub is indeed not a \"klub\" for the weak of stomach.

All I kept saying to myself while I was there was that I can do better than this at home. The chicken wings were cooked fine, but the seasoning taste no different than using Lawreys seasoning. And why limit the chicken and waffles to just wings? In LA you can get any pieces you want and you get them smothered in a nice dark brown gravy. Now that's how you should try chicken and waffles. With brown gravy smothered chicken and shared on a plate of delicious waffles and syrup. True breakfast paradise...but, that's not this place. I really wanted this place to work out for me especially after having to drive all the way downtown and standing in line for such a long time. I was sadly disappointed in the taste of the food.

Actual restaurant experiences may vary.After having a procedure done at one of the nearby hospitals in the museum district - the type of procedure where you are not allowed to eat for 1-2 days and your system is totally flushed - my first groggy, post-op request to my wife was to find FOOD and stat!We (I) decided on The Breakfast Klub for two reasons: 1) It was still morning and breakfast food seemed to be in order and 2) I was STARVING! The previous night, while in the midst of the sick and sadistic Dr. imposed hunger fast, I decided to pass the time by browsing yelp reviews (smart right?). The Breakfast Klub caught my eye, as well as a bookmark, due to the rave chicken and waffle reviews. For close to 6 years I have been trying to persuade the wife to partake with me in the tantric act of combining such food as chicken and waffles but I have always been turned down. This time I thought for sure I wouldn't be rejected, especially in my helpless state. So I made the choice - go chicken and waffles or go home!The actual review:Arrived around 10:00 AM and parking was impossible due to its small lot so we found an open meter down the street. \u00a0Atmosphere would be classified as \"Upscale-Dive\". Upon entering we were handed a menu and ushered forward in a short line. Quick glance and I see a ton of great options - oh, I thought I was just here to get chicken and waffles... Far too quickly for my liking we have to order and I \"chicken\" out and end up go for the Eggs Benedict... as it sounds easier on my recently tenderized insides. Don't hate me, I was weak. Wife goes for a classic - waffle with eggs and sausage. We top off the order with a tall glass of milk for me and a large mug of mocha for her. We find a seat in a booth nearby and I take a peep at what those around us are enjoying... and I instantly begin to regret my choice... stupid me, you came here for chicken and waffles! Oh well, too late now.Food was prepared and came out in a timely manner. Upon seeing my order all regrets flew out the window! Now this is plate of Eggs Benedict! Bacon, ham, turkey, wonderful bread, and let us not forgets them eggs! It could be the drugs, it could be the fact I haven't eaten a solid meal in 2 days, but man-oh-man this is amazing! I gobbled it up despite my wife's warning to take it slow (so wise she is) and sat in blissful happiness while she finished hers (which she agreed was excellent as well - especially the mocha).Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back to take on the chicken and waffles when I'm feeling back up to par.Atmosphere: 4 out of 5 starsService: 4 out of 5 starsFood: 4 out 5 stars", "Date": "2013-06-27", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Chinelo O.", "ReviewID": "CcRjfFWmwmg49udUzIaACw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Long line that moves appropriately.

The Breakfast Klub is the greastest restauraunt on the face of the planet.There is always a line to enter, but it moves quickly because of the perfect system of ordering food and seating in place. If you show up on a weekend, expect to wait for about an hour to get inside the door, and then another five minutes to get your food. The woman who hands out menus and shows the daily (weekday) lunch specials to those waiting outside is very nice and will joke around with you if that's what you're into. The people at the cash register can be impatient, but its not like you haven't been looking at the menu for at least 20 minutes before you get up there- come on!The food is a slice of heaven baked in the kitchen of the lord while the chef wears a apron made out the same clothes Jesus wore when he did the bread and fish/wine thing. The Coffee is also very good.Every single item on the menu tastes like the moon (out of this world). This can cause trouble when ordering. For example, if you order the most delicious french toast or the amazing Waffle (with Wings that were cooked in Mother Mary's deepfry) you know your are missing out the best omlette you'll ever have or the hunger/spirit filling Catfish and Grits. This is why it is important to come here often- so you can try everything.The only complaint is that now every meal I eat that isn't here is bland and lacking in flavor, every cup of coffee is dry and bitter, and every hostess is an rude miser out to make my dining experience miserable.

This isn't a restaurant, it's an experience. The line snakes out, and you wait, and wait, and wait. And as you wait, the smell of food wafts across the parking lot.

On nice days, there may be tables and chairs to act as overflow.Once inside, the ordering is efficient, as you probably had ample time to figure out what you want (catfish and grits, didn't even need the menu). Coffee is on the left, weak to strong, and all excellent.Grab your number, find a seat, and wait patiently for the magic to come to the table in katfish form. Fried orange brown, bursting with flavor from delectable tip to delectable tip, the piece is huge. Sitting next to it is a volcano of buttery grits, the caldera a lake of melted butter. An accompanying biscuit could have been the star of an entr\u00e9e elsewhere, but here it harmonizes the perfection of the plate.The portion size is insanely huge. I split this thing with the wife, and added a second biscuit and side of gravy. On that note, the biscuits and gravy is a deliciously awesome alternative if you're not feeling for the Katfish con grits.Yes, waiting in the line is worth it.

Later on I found out that people were lining up to go in and have some highly-reputed breakfast at the Breakfast Klub, and it became obvious to me that the well-dressed people came from the church a block over, or any of the other churches nearby. I knew I had to go, and had discussed it with a friend, but I'd put it off for sometime until I told this same friend about hearing that the chicken and waffle had made some sort of national \"best\" list.It was a Saturday morning and we walked from her place to the Klub. The line was long, but the conversation was good. There was water readily available, canopies to shelter us from the blistering sun, and the owner made sure to greet and spend time with everyone as he made his way into the Klub. I almost wanted to think \"who's this weird guy saying hi to everyone,\" but he didn't give me a weird vibe. My friend did mention that she thought the guy was just trying to cut in line, so I kinda laughed when I pointed out his portrait printed on the side of the pyramid stack of waffle mix boxes once we were inside.Now, I am not \u00a0exactly a fan of waffles, so I'll limit my discussion of it to saying that it was as enjoyable as any other waffle I've had. It served its purpose of soaking up syrup and being carby. The wings, however... YOWZA! The batter was spiced just right to give a kick and sort of made me feel like I was experiencing the wonders of my first-ever bite of fried chicken all over again. It was just that good. Being picky, I could say that it was a bit too greasy, but it's freaking fried chicken.The sweet tea was too sweet for me. It was syrupy and I'd be willing to wager it was at least partially sweetened with honey... it was almost like drinking honey.

Granted, there is a reason that the wait for weekend brunch is ridiculously long, since the food is A-MAZING but it doesn't make me any less annoyed! But overall, regardless of the wait, I really love this place. Whoever concocted up the waffles/chicken wings combination is a bloody genius and should get 100 medals. I LOVE the wings and waffles here, it is the only dish I get. I've had wings and waffles at other restaurants before, but I love that these waffles are perfectly cooked, not too sweet but not too bland, not too crunch but not too soft, JUST RIGHT. And I've always liked chicken wings over drumsticks (harder to eat, but so much more fun!) and the chicken wings that The Breakfast Klub uses is crispy on the outside and so deliciously moist on the inside. Combine it all together with some butter and syrup and you have heaven in your mouth. Sometimes I try to order a side of potatoes but I don't know why I do that to myself because I am just SO full from the wings and waffles I can only take a bite or two of the potatoes. What a waste, I know. But the potatoes are tasty as well! And although the wait in LINE is long, once you order your food, the wait for that is incredibly quick! To be honest, I have a feeling they just make wings & waffles nonstop because of the sheer amount of orders they get, but hey, if I get my wings & waffles within a few minutes of sitting down at my table, I AIN'T COMPLAININ'. Love the staff here, they are all incredibly friendly and they check up on you constantly during your meal to make sure everything is okay. Randomly went on a weekday for lunch and was pleasantly surprised that there was 1) no wait and 2) live music. Granted, the music makes it a little loud to hold an intimate conversation, but when you're eating comfort food... AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR AN INTIMATE CONVERSATION. It's time to forget what's around you and tuck in to your plate!Sidenote: If you have a big group, GET IN LINE ALL AT ONCE.

I've always said I wouldn't take off stars for something a restaurant can't control, like how long the line is, so I'm sticking to my guns for this one. Yes, the line can become brutal in the hot Houston summer but they do provide ice water and some canopies to offset this so I do have to give them credit for trying to help their patrons out. I think the longest I've ever waited in line here is just over an hour and a half. But as a warning, if you want to have Sunday brunch here, get in line before 10:30 or else you're due for an hour wait minimum. \u00a0Onto the breakdown!Atmosphere: The atmosphere is pretty cozy, the tables don't have an overly cramped feeling and they are decently spaced from each other. There's local artwork on the walls and they always play music I like. In addition I like how the drinks and condiments area has a slightly enclosed space that doesn't infringe upon the seating areas. Overall the atmosphere is great for a brunch place.Service: The ordering setup involves placing your order at a cashier and you're given a number, you then proceed to claim a table and collect your own beverages and condiments. There is a server who will help seat large group, but I usually come in parties of 4 or smaller so we find our own table. Once seated the food comes out pretty quickly. In addition the servers will stop by periodically and politely ask how things taste. What I love about this restaurant is that despite its overwhelming popularity, I have never felt rushed by the staff. Essentially the in and out rate is customer regulated but it works perfectly. I've almost never had problems finding an open table after placing my order.Food: The important thing here is the food! I always get almost the same thing with a random side order of whatever I am feeling. I get the Catfish and Grits with Texas toast, potatoes and grits. I pass on the eggs because I can make eggs on my own. You have the option of getting cheese grits as well. I personally prefer classic butter grits. I've tried the wings and they are well seasoned but you could get the waffle at almost any other brunch spotThe catfish is breaded and fried, but the seasoning on the breading is amazing. It is a pretty salty dish. The catfish has as good of a texture as catfish can have. Personally when it comes to fish, catfish isn't one of my favorites; I prefer saltwater fish (yes I know it's ironic because I'm from the midwest aka the home of freshwater great lakes fish). Freshwater fish tends to have that slightly muddy, fishy taste that saltwater fish normally doesn't have. In addition catfish are kind of similar to bottom dwellers so there is usually a stronger muddy taste and the texture of catfish is \"meatier\" than most fish which makes it unusual as well. HOWEVER fish analysis detour aside, the catfish here is as good as catfish gets. The potatoes are skillet fried and southwestern style with bell peppers and onions and are extremely flavorful and delicious. The Texas toast is classic heavily buttered Texas Toast and tastes great with preserves (it's the savory/sweet combo that gets me). As far as grits are concerned the ones here are amazing. They come out with a small pool of butter placed in an indent in the middle that I usually stir quickly into the rest of the grits so I can continue my delusions of healthy eating. As far as side orders are concerned I have added on french toast, waffles, and extra grits on separate occasions. The french toast is great. There's the perfect touch of cinnamon and the coating isn't overwhelming. The waffle is obviously amazing since it comprising 1/2 of the other signature dish at the restaurant. The waffle is fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. As far as extra grits is concerned, like I said, I prefer to delude myself into thinking they are psuedo \"healthy\". I will make a note that their prices have been rapidly increasing in the last 3 years. The first time I went to the Breakfast Klub 3 years ago, my ex and I probably spent around $30 (tip included) for \u00a0an order of Catfish and Grits, an order of Chicken and Waffles, and two drinks. This last time I ordered an order of Catfish and Grits, a side order of grits, and a drink and apparently spent $30 also after tip.

Later on, my friend (who use to work at BK), told me she lucked up on a free lot across the street at the vacant store, but they're far and few in between. \u00a0 There's also another lot closer to the freeway for BK patrons, but not really any signage to dictate that.

That was really sweet especially we were standing there for half an hour for our friends to arrive. The line also moved fairly fast so we didn't wait too long for our breakfast. We ordered their signature dishes - chicken wing with waffles and catfish with grits. I loved their chicken wings, which were marinated thoroughly with great flavor and breaded nicely with thin crust outside. The wings were fried to perfection with crispy outside and juicy tender inside. I also liked their catfish which was again breaded well and fried perfectly. I enjoyed the grits without butter. I asked the butter to be put on the side because I knew I will not use it even. The grits was great balance with the greasy catfish. I enjoyed the meal very much with their unlimited coffee. It was a fulfilling, tasty, southern, comfort food breakfast. However, it was VERY heavy with lots of butter and loaded with tons of carbohydrate items. This is the reason why I only give 4 stars because it was a very heavy meal with somewhat a chaotic environment. When we were there eating, the line outside grew longer and longer. I could feel the environment inside was intense and rushed. I wish that I can enjoy the meal without the feeling of crowded, rushed, or chaotic. Furthermore, I can probably only eat this type of breakfast once every few months since it is incredibly heavy on butter and carbs. I will definitely return to this restaurant again with my friends and enjoy their wings with waffles or catfish with grits.", "Date": "2013-03-29", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Sahrish K.", "ReviewID": "XsUIhSeGta9Q65Qlt130SA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "chicken and waffles. enough said.", "Date": "2014-04-16", "Author_Location": "Cypress, TX"}, {"Author": "Chelsea S.", "ReviewID": "Y4EqtCqq-SBcbit5d6AU9g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This place is delicious!

The combination of the two? Oh yeah, pretty much perfection. The first time I went to the Breakfast Klub actually has a funny story attached to it. At the time I was working for the Houston Rockets and being the avid fan that I am of the team, I knew that several of the players frequent the BK on their down time. I made a joke to the people accompanying me that it would be funny if we ran into one of the guys. It was the morning after a home game against the Lakers, which we won much to Battier's leadership and rally in the 4th quarter, so some of the staff noticed my Rockets shirt and we talked for a bit about the game the night before. On a sidenote, the staff are all extremely nice and friendly people and love talking to you while you wait in that long line. \u00a0Anyways, next thing I know Jordan Hill strolls in through the doors and it doesn't matter that I've been to a million games and have seen most of the guys up close, I still act like I've seen the president or something. Since the boys go to the BK a lot, the staff knows them well enough and vice versa. One of the employees called Jordan over and pointed out that I was one of his \"co-workers.\" He just gave me a head nod and I awkwardly waved at him in return. Probably not my finest hour and one that when I re-think it in my head, I know I could have at least tried to come off as not a complete spaz. But to get to the point and talk about the actual food, BK never disappoints. Regardless of the wait, it's absolutely worth it and you will think the same thing after you've gone through that really long line and have taken that first bite. That's at least \u00a0how I feel. Famous for the chicken & waffles, I feel that it's almost an immediate must to try this at least once even if something else on the menu sounds appealing. Their fried chicken is just the right amount of juicy and their Belgian waffle is soft but has the right amount of crisp to it. I've also tried their French toast, while not my favorite or the best French toast I've ever had, still beats some of the other breakfast places out there.If you're impatient and don't like long lines then I suggest showing up right when they open or a little after, but I haven't heard of them turning anyone away in the line even though they do close at 2pm.

I'd heard of the raves The Breakfast Klub gets, and, though nothing on the menu really screamed out at me (catfish, grits--not my thing), besides the wings and waffles, I figured The BK was one of those places you have to check out as a Houston native. The first time I came, there was a line out the door, and having no idea how fast the food came out, I bounced. Standing in July heat? Thank you ma'am, but I must beg your pardon.I recently came on a weekday for breakfast, so there were only five people or so ahead of me. Imagine my surprise when this older Southern lady asked me if I'd been here and proceeded to explain how everything worked (order, get a number, hot syrup to the side). For this place's cult popularity, I was imagining something like those videos you see of places which are known for their rudeness. My friend was already waiting at a table for us, so I was really surprised to see that she already had her food. My other friend got his wings and waffles within five minutes, and my Breakfast \"Klub\" came within three minutes. Now, I'm the sort of person who likes trying out crazy shit with my food. \u00a0Green tea powder? I'll just dump it in my cookies, ice cream, rice, and eggs (ham and green eggs, y'all). I've made bacon pancakes and bacon chocolate chip cookies, and have dreamed of the day when I'll be able to make waffles with fried chicken pieces in them. Until that day comes, chicken wings and waffles will suffice. The waffles--which was really one big round waffle--were standard, but the wings were the shiznitz. They were juicy, a little spicy, and crisp, without being oily. I tried getting wings and waffle in the same bites, but it was like having two separate entities in my mouth. I'm still going to make winged waffles one day (I have an image of Red Bull waffles). I'm pretty sure the Breakfast \"Klub\" would've induced a heart attack if I were in my 50s (that's why you have to eat all the fattening food while you're young, right?). It had thick bacon, presliced cheese, and the bread was slathered--no, soaked---in butter. It was kind of awesome, but kind of not. You know that duality that really, really fattening foods have.One thing I thought was awesome was the picture of Obama they had on one of the rails. At first, I thought it was a signed picture, how some restaurants have celebrities and dignitaries who come in to dine sign pictures, but then I realized it was just a picture of the Benevolent Obama, looking out for all the Breakfast Klubbers the way a Buddha would look out over the diners of a Chinese restaurant.", "Date": "2010-08-18", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Derrick C.", "ReviewID": "YWVeFmd79wg3P5_3AHGehA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The wait here can be ridiculous. \u00a0Be ready to wait for up to an hour. \u00a0But the food is pretty damn good. \u00a0Fried chicken and waffles looked a little dry at first but the chicken is super moist and you can douse the waffles in as much homemade syrup as you like. \u00a0The catfish is also a must try but I'd go w/ the chicken first.", "Date": "2013-01-21", "Author_Location": "Sacramento, CA"}, {"Author": "Carolyn C.", "ReviewID": "h8olTMRCXBcSDJREoJqRkg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Breakfast Klub is good, however you should go at a strange time (when they open) on a weird day (tuesday).

The Korean Slave Institution, aka Samsung Austin Semiconductor (where my friend is still currently held captive), has constructed a bamboo ceiling that continues to stint non-Korean employee growth and dishearten talented and ambitious young future leaders - who end up quitting for bigger and better opportunities (thank God). He, being one of these unfortunate people (sans the quitting part), wanted to see if Houston was a great place to live and seek employment. Though Houston lacks many unique outdoor amenities found in Austin, it makes up in numerous classy night clubs, exquisite museums, and southern style gastronomic landmarks (viz., The Breakfast Klub - according to Yelp). Heeding all the positive reviews, I took him and some friends here to show them what soul food was all about even though it was my first time as well. We got there around 11AM Sunday morning and were not surprised to see the infamously long line that wrapped around the building. Hallelujah for their strategically placed canopies and mist fans for I would have literally turned lobster red and melted in the scorching Houston heat without them. As we approached the entrance, our orders were taken ahead of time by a wandering host, who made the ordering process smooth and steady - much appreciated, kind sir. I ordered the chicken and waffles and sweet iced tea and my buddy ordered the fried catfish plate with buttered grits. By the time I grabbed utensils, napkins, maple syrup, and Tabasco sauce (can't live without it), my food was already out to be served, which was a blessing for we had to sit outside in the blistering heat - there was covering, though. The waffle was slightly crisp on the outside and amazingly light and fluffy on the inside. Its consistency was the best I've ever had and was just divine when matched with the aromatic waffle flavor and a smudge of maple syrup. Scattered around the scrumptious waffle were crisp chicken wings. A little disappointed that they were mere wings instead of a whole thigh, I was still pleased with its bold flavor. The batter used to coat each wing was heavily seasoned and spared no time making your palate aware of its presence. Though it was decent, I wasn't too impressed with their wings for I've been spoiled by wings from Pluckers. I tried my buddy's catfish and grits and was satisfied with how un-fishy, well seasoned, and crisp the catfish was and how buttery and smooth the grits were - he too was quite impressed. Their sweet iced tea, on the other hand, was not pleasant. To them, \"sweet\" meant tumultuous amounts of sugar. Seriously, it was so \"sweet\" Willy Wonka slapped his oompa loompas for making his chocolate taste like turd.

I loved the wings, but the French toast wasn't really anything special. I do LOVE the fact that they have a hot syrup station. There is also a great coffee station with 4 or 5 different coffees. I had the coffee from El Salvador (or maybe it was Guatemala?), and it was fantastic.I was a little confused with the tipping situation. There is a tip jar up front when you place your order, like a coffee shop. But they DO bring your food out to you, like a waitress/waiter. But during my meal, I didn't get visited once by anyone to see if I needed anything (you even get your own drinks), so are you supposed to tip anyone? Maybe yes, since they are clearing your table off when you leave? As I was getting ready to leave I got up to get a refill on coffee to-go, and after I got up a couple people swooped in and took my table, and I hadn't left a tip. So maybe you're not supposed to tip, or maybe those workers now have an awful impression of Northwestern University (I was wearing an NU shirt at the time).

The potatoes are seasoned to perfection, I'm so glad I got those instead of eggs.. because eggs are eggs no matter where you go, but potatoes aren't always as good as they make them (those were some damn good potatoes!). The Katfish was AMAZING, it was perfectly seasoned and thickly battered. The Katfish alone will make me go back again. And THE biscuits!.. So the cashier, when taking my order, asked \"toast or biscuits?\" And of course I looked confused, not knowing which way to go. So I asked which one is better. She said, \"yeah, the biscuits are good\"... all nonchalantly. So I went with it. The biscuits were amazing, better than most biscuits. I got some butter to butter them, no need.

My friend had the eggs benedict and I tried some. It was pretty good, but I liked mine better.

After we made our order, we got our food within 5 minutes, very speedy! My boyfriend ordered the wings and waffles, and I got catfish and grits along with a cafe mocha. The wings and waffles were fantastic, I wish I got that instead! The wings were seasoned perfectly, and it also had a tangy, Tobasco-esque flavor to it. The meat was moist and flavorful. The waffles were fluffy and moist, and they paired well with the chicken. My catfish and grits were also decent. The catfish was seasoned and breaded nicely, although it was a bit too salty for my liking. I don't usually like grits, but the grits at BK were soft and buttery. It was a bit too heavy for me, so I only had a few bites. The cafe mocha was wayyy too sweet for me, though. I took it back home afterward and put a ton of ice cubes in it.

Well here is my 5 star review...I, like you had read the previous reviews and saw that there is usually a line to get into this place so I naturally thought we should show up early. I was the first one in line today and briefly left to give a friend some change for the meter only to walk back and find 10 people standing in line. As we wait for the doors to open, mingling with the nice lady that works the line handing out menus, I notice the line gain another 10, 20, +30 before they let us in. As we walk in we hear the workers cheering and clapping then it's quiet, a voice rings out thanking us for coming out and welcome to \"THE BREAKFAST KLUB\"!!! Definitely an amazing way to start out my day, especially after a crappy night-shift at work.So, we get to the register and I order the wings and waffle plate with a single side of biskit and gravy. My buddy orders grilled pork chops with egg and grits. We get our drinks, get a table and look over all of the art work that is on the walls. I look outside and realize that the line never gets smaller, people just keep walking up, amazing! Our food comes out and I first dig into the waffle with some syrup and it's a pretty strait forward waffle, then I grab a drumstick and take a bite of the wing...!!!!!!!!!! All of these different feeling hit me as I took that bite. Tenderness! Spice! Taste! Krispy! Juicy! Juicy! To put it simply, it was the best wings that I have EVER eaten! (Im craving them as I type this) Next, I pour over a little gravy on the biskit and dig into the the different, but deliciously different biskit and gravy. Wasnt like my moms recipe but just as good. I haven't had a great breakfast like this anywhere. As I finished my meal I sat there thinking that this place surpassed any of my high expectations for the really hyped place. As I walked to my vehicle I was already planning my next trip there. Great place, great staff, great food! Couldn't ask for more!

The wings n waffles are so good -- not dried out like some fried chicken can be. The batter on the wings is reminiscent of Frenchy's if you've ever had their chicken. You only get one waffle with that dish though. The pancake plate comes with HUGE pancakes so be prepared to have leftovers. For sides, the grits and potatoes taste like down-home cooking at your grandma's house in the country. I've gone with people who've gotten the pork chops and omlettes and they raved about those items as well. I wish I could talk about more of the menu but I really love what I get so I haven't tried everything. And as many times as I've been I don't think I've ever had lunch!The bottled lemonade and sweet tea drinks are freshly made but to me they're a little pricey at around $3 each. Personally, I LOVE the Karmel Macchiato, which I think costs $5-6 but it's worth every penny. It's served in a TBK oversized mug, which probably holds the equivalent of a medium coffee at a chain. I would much rather give my money to a Houstonian! The only con is that if you go during a peak time, the line will be wrapped around the building. That's the price you pay for dining at such a hot spot! The staff members are always friendly and will come around and ask how you're doing. Even the owner walks around and chats with customers.

He basically said it will be separate from the restaurant...I don't have to lie and it is not that serious...either you think it's (the pilot idea aforementioned ) a good idea for your business...or you see it isn't working...but don't try and hoodwink a customer out of pride..it can cost you..and perhaps dearly one day...Do not insult \u00a0ANYBODY'S intelligence or power as a consumer...\"The customer is ALWAYS right\"-Marshall Field", "Date": "2012-11-04", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Dien P.", "ReviewID": "tDE4rc1dE8WmDWSVUyupmA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Food is great, owner even came to every table see how everyone was doing.

They have various blends of coffee to choose from, starting with decaf on the left then it gets stronger as you move towards the right. On my first trip i was incredibly underwhelmed by the food. My mistake was ordering something safe - a standard breakfast plate of eggs, bacon, and toast. This time I went with one of their signature dishes, the wings and waffles, only I substituted (at no extra cost) the waffle for some french toast. This is a winning combination! I don't know where I've ever had better fried chicken in my entire life. It had a perfect seasoning, and was crispy and juicy but not at all greasy. The french toast was crispy and fluffy in all the right places and was so delicious. The owner came around to check on everyone.

The hollandaise was more like a lemon flavored gravy, and the whole plate was smothered (not dusted)- literally doused- in a thick red layer of smoked paprika. I couldn't really eat a bite without gagging. The concept was good - a biscuit for the the English muffin, and then layered with bacon, ham, and turkey, but in addition to the nasty hollandaise and the gross paprika red sheen, I suffered through under cooked poached eggs. I literally took one bite before I shoved it away and then grazed off my friends' plates. Should I ever have nothing better to do, there's a slim chance I'd return.

They are made at the restaurant and are loaded with some sort of herb. I didn't particularly care for it, but he seemed to enjoy it.
