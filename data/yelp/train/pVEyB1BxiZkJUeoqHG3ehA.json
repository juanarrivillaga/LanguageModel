I loved the ambience of the place- dimly lit and beautifully decorated. So atmosphere was 5/5. The service was great as well. The waiter always came to check up on how our table was doing. We started off with foie gras and some bread. It was my first time trying out foie gras and it was delicious. My main dish was the chicken with the fries. The chicken was cooked and flavored perfectly. It was not dry at all. However, I wasn't a big fan of the fries; they were a bit too salty for my taste. Moreover, they didn't taste fresh. For dessert, we got the crem brulee. It was great with just the right amount of sweetness. Overall, it was good, just a bit on the pricier side.

The dishes were all delicious and the service was just as friendly, attentive, and helpful as I remembered. We ordered our entr\u00e9es, the pork chop, duck confit, and tilefish special, entirely based on our server's advice, and we all left satisfied. According to our server (Patrick?), the chef lovingly brines the pork for two days, which probably explains why it's so incredibly delicious. The kale side was so good, it converted a kale-hater into a begrudging kale-lover. The duck was fall-off-the-bone tender and succulently sweet, well-accompanied by salad and sweet red rice. The tilefish was also delicious, a delicately well-executed dish. The wine (a decently priced Cotes du Rhone) was great and the drinks were quite strong, definitely contributing to our general good time at this restaurant.

For the meal, we both ordered from the 3 course prix fixe meal and a few drinks. I ordered: French onion soup, steak frites(medium rare), molten chocolate cakeHusband ordered: French onion soup, roasted chicken, apple cake with ice creamEverything was flavorful and well executed except for a little incident with my soup (hence, the deduction of a star) which the server and manager took care of immediately, and the steak being medium than the medium rare I had ordered. Still, the service was wonderful and our server, Zach, made great recommendations from drinks to entrees. Parking also isn't too bad. I found 2 HR street parking right outside the restaurant, but in case you don't want to deal with that, there is a lot right next door where you can park for a fee. Though I'm not quite sure what the fee is. The interior had a nice casual chic vibe but you didn't feel underdressed if you walked in wearing jeans and a shirt.

Only because I've returned for dinner this time. And dinner was damn delicious. My friend and I decided to get dinner on a Friday night, and we got the prix fixe special. I had never had French onion soup before because I hate Swiss cheese...but this soup had gruyere cheese on French crostinis in a large ramekin. That soup was delicious and was a great start to the meal. Our entrees were steak frites with bearnaise or herbed butter. I wasn't sure which one I wanted and so I asked for both. Naturally, I preferred the bearnaise. The steak was cooked perfectly, and I was quite pleased. Each time I took a bite of steak drenched in bearnaise, I heard Julia Child in my head...\"You want to make sure you have enough butter for your bearnaise sauce...\". I think I've seen that episode a few times.Dessert was decadently delectable. \u00a0We both ordered the molten chocolate cake. This has to be one of the best molten chocolate cakes I've ever had because the chocolate was nice and dark, the cake was fluffy, and overall it wasn't super sweet, which I really appreciated. It was very, very nice on the palate, and the perfect end to a great dinner. Complimentary glass of house red wine was THE BEST pairing with the steak and molten chocolate cake. Service was awesome.

The beer choices were limited but ok...it is not a craft beer kind of place and I did manage to find something suitable. We were seated outside and it was a lovely evening but there was no real atmosphere (no little pin lights etc) but also ok. Besides how loud it was inside, \u00a0my issues were: one of my friends salad was so salty it was inedible. It was as if it had been dressed in pure brine. He asked the waiter to take it back and it was politely removed from the bill. My scallops were cooked well but the vanilla agre dulce was pure vanilla (which i like) but there was not even a hint of vinegar or citrus. My understanding of agre dulce is sweet and sour components yet no acid which gave the scallops a desert-like quality to them. Given this is not the place to go if you are on a limited budget (came to about $50 per person minus the salad only one person had an appetizer and one person had no drinks), I will not be going back.*****AS OF 7/11/14: AS PROMISED, I DID RECEIVE A GENEROUS GIFT CERTIFICATE SO MY FRIENDS AND I CAN GIVE GASLIGHT ANOTHER TRY.

For the most part, everyone in our large party seemed to enjoy their food, and most looked better than mine, but I have to say that for a place that's so popular for brunch, their scrambled eggs are sorely, sorely lacking and have left an overall underwhelming impression.Many of us ordered from the prix fixe brunch special (available all day Saturday and from 10 to 11 am on Sunday) which is a great deal for $9.95/person. You get coffee or tea plus fresh squeezed orange or grapefruit juice, a shortbread with raspberry jam, and a choice of three entrees: vanilla french toast, omelette, or scrambled eggs. Here's a tip, do NOT get the scrambled eggs because you will be very, very disappointed. When scrambled eggs are good, they're so good--melt in your mouth, light and fluffy good. And at a restaurant so popular for its brunch, that's what I was imagining--a plate that would school my mouth in the art of scrambled eggs. Sadly, all I got were bland, overcooked, clumpy scrambled eggs, yikes. This seems like a pretty basic thing that a brunch place should have mastered.On the other hand, their croissants are warm and buttery, crispy on the outside with pillowy layers of love on the inside, nothing short of magical. It's not very large and it'll cost you $3+ but it is a great croissant.It's probably my fault for ordering the \"wrong\" item (the scrambled eggs) but in my opinion, there really shouldn't be a \"wrong\" item, and it especially shouldn't be a fundamental breakfast staple. That being said, I'm still eager to return for lunch or dinner and I'm very hopeful that I'll have a better experience. Tip: While you're waiting to order, your waiter will ask you very nonchalantly if you'd like him to bring you a pastry basket. Just a heads up, this is not a complimentary bread basket, he's referring to the $12 item on the menu which contains 4 small pastries.", "Date": "2014-04-06", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Minh C.", "ReviewID": "p_hOh3HJA_yfEbld3uR9Cg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had brunch at Gaslight last Saturday.

This is the perfect place for friends, family or a couple to grab brunch on a lazy weekend (brunch served 9am - 3pm). Gaslight has a laid back but hip atmosphere with unique decor (surely some good conversation starters). We were offered coffee as soon as we were seated. About $4 for unlimited refills. The menu was extensive. Although offered the brunch special menu ($10 for 3 courses, sorta) the entree's were not half as interesting as what was on the regular menu. Our server made 4 amazing recommendations and we actually went for 3 out of the 4 dishes. I ordered the Poached Eggs a la Bearnaise - $10.25 - It came with sauteed kale & caramelized onions, which were well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The 3 poached eggs spend JUST the right amount of time boiling in water so that the yolks were runny but the whites were fully done yet still tender. Honestly, the bearnaise sauce was a distraction from how delicious the vegetables, egg and toasted slice of baguette combined together in my mouth. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat...but not before I also try the 3 other benedict-type dishes!!! We shared: Vanilla French Toast - $10.5 - BEST french toast I have EVER had. It came \"With apple caramel & syrup\". Which was really cubed CANDIED apples, so the entire dish was quite literally sugar heaven. The french toast itself was really AMAZING. Thick-cut eggy bread that was dipped in a vanilla batter. Griddled until the edges were a golden crispy brown while the insides were a melt-in-your-mouth pudding. I could seriously eat this every weekend. Finally, the last dish we tried was also the LEAST favorite of our 3. Berkshire Pork Hache $15.5 - with Confit pork, crispy potatoes, chili sauce verte & fried eggs - It sounded a LOT more hearty than it really was. We were served sort of a pork and potato hash patty layered with two fried eggs over the top. The pork and potato patty was far too salty and overseasoned. I abandoned the dish after 1 bite. Either the salt in the meat needs to be toned down, or the dish needs some kind of bread or avocado to even out the sodium overload. My final 2 cents - Totally come here for brunch! Avoid the pork hache if you don't want hypertension or don't enjoy overly salty dishes. Don't miss out on the french toast!!!!

I've wanted to come here since I heard about its opening when I lived in Boston a few years ago. \u00a0It's such a cute, charming French bistro. Better than less gimmacky than others in Boston's past (ahem Bouchee on newbury which no longer exists). Made a reservation on a Wednesday for a girlfriend and me at 745. We were seated promptly into a nice big booth- no one was really there. Decor is French bistro- cherry wood, lots of gas lamps, Etc. The service is nice as well- prompt, helpful etc. As for the food, yum! We started off with a complimentary French baguette with yummy homemade freshly whipped butter. \u00a0We started off with the fondue which was basically melted fontina in a skillet with onion and flat pieces of baguette. This might have been the biggest disappointment \u00a0of the night given we thought we were getting a fondue pot. Oh well. For dinner, my friend had the warm pear salad and a side of pomme frites. Have to say- the frites were whatever. Good , fried, skinny fries but didn't have much flavor. Even the mayo didn't stand out. I didn't have the salad but it looked good. I had feb roasted cod poulee which was delicious! \u00a0Nicely seared with basting in a tomato cream sauce , tomato, mussels and pieces of chorizo. It was sort of like a bouillabaisse. Had a side of Sauvignon blanc which was great and my friend went with a muscadet. As far as dessert , wow that was probably the best thing we had all night. We skipped typical fare like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and went for the toasted coconut later cake which was The Bomb. Super soaked in coconut flavor, with shreds of coconut plentiful, the cake tasted like it had some kind of mascarpone in there because it was quite cheesy but I think that was just the coconut cream and line syrup. \u00a0It was also so big we couldn't finish it. A must try for any sweets person. A great experience. Not to mention the prices are really reasonable for what you get.

For appetizer, I got the Roasted Tomato Bisque, it was rich and creamy tomato soup with Parmesan toppings that tamed the acidic sharpness of the tomatoes, a appetizer that actually appetites. I also tried the other appetizer on the menu: Blue Ridge Farms Goat Cheese Beignets, I was never a fan of goat cheese and after trying this dish, my opinion remains the same. While the balls of coated goat cheese was soft and creamy like cream cheese, it was a little too sour for me to be enjoyable. For my entree, I got the House Made Tagliatelle, which was truffle pasta and it was delicious. I am a big fan of truffles and the sauce was full of buttery truffle flavors, definitely a dish I am looking forward to eating again.

Jeffrey, thank you very much for your attempt to help me change my mind about your restaurant, but unfortunately, your staff didn't have the same inclination.Reservation: I was so excited to come back to give this place another try. I called at 9am on friday, not expecting them to be open, but I did leave a message about \u00a0reservations for that night. By noontime I still didn't hear anything back so I called again. Reservation made for 9pm. Great. Perfect. 8:55pm, cab troubles so I call and tell them we'll be 10 mins late. We get there at 9:12 and was told we're on a waitlist so please hang by the bar. 15 mins of standing around and I ask for our table--nope, still on a waitlist. What's the point of making a reservation if I still get put onto a waiting list.Service: Never got the waiter's name. He walked away without getting the manfriend's order. But he did spend a considerable amount of time shmoozing over the big group next to us--completely missing my date comically waving his hands in the air for attention. A staff member, perhaps a manager, also made it a point to come over to our table and said no more bread. If you're making me wait to simply put in an order for food, then give me bread--I'll even pay for it if your restaurant can't afford it. The bussers were very nice though and one of them actually ended up putting in my order for a side item....instead of my waiter.OH HEY GUESS WHAT, I ALSO GOT MY OWN DRINK SPILLED ON ME. Not even an apology from the waiter. He looked at the drink, looked at me, laughed, and said whoops. Sorry buddy....none of that was funny. My suede shoes weren't really made for pisco sour showers, thank you.Food: Cod poelee--every piece of seafood was overcooked. BUT the sauce was slurp worth--absolutely delicious. Date enjoyed his french onion soup (he gave up on ordering an entree). The kitchen must've had salt to spare that night--way too heavy handed on the roasted cauliflower. Dessert--are you kidding me? We didn't have another hour to spend there, so we hightailed it and headed back home to the Tip Tap room for a generous portion of venison with bread and butter that a manager made sure I got two helpings of. Again, Jeff, thank you very much for trying to make up my first bad experience but unfortunately, this one only reinforced how terrible your waitstaff is.

Me and my boyfriend came in for dinner The Food - Main DishI ordered Coq au Vin Taglietelle, is a red wine braised chicken, pearl onions and slices of bacon. I was disappointed when the food came as i have pictured it differently. They should change the description of the menu for this one. However, the dish was delicious and i love it! The pasta was great and the sauce is not a typical italian sauce, as it should be more tend towards French cuisine. I love the sauce, the only downside will be the little amount of shredded chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Confit, THIS IS A PERFECT DUCK!!! the duck was perfectly cooked, it was cripy on the skin and there is no fat in between the skin and the meat itself, there is just nothing wrong with this dish! If you would like to eat a french cuisine, this is the dish to go for!The Food - DessertFor dessert, we ordered the Cr\u00e9me Brul\u00e9e and Chocolate Beignets, the Cr\u00e9me Brul\u00e9e is as good as it gets!!! and the Chocolate Beignets is something i have not tried before, it is a mix of donut and chocolate lava cake.The outside is crispy but on the inside is like a lava cake and eat it with the creme it was just delicious!!!!AtmosphereThe atmosphere is like you're in a french restaurant, people were dressed smart casual but you can tell if someone is having an occasion just the way they dressed for ex.

The prixe fix menu means affordable brunches. The outdoor seating makes it spring and summer friendly. # Service- The waiters here are especially attentive and pleasant to be around. They were quick to correct any errors. We ordered our omelette with toast instead of fries, but received fries accidentally. They were quick to deliver new pieces of toast. They are very food allergy friendly. # What to order- Make sure to ask about the prixe fix menu if you're there anytime on Saturday or 10-11 am on Sunday. It's such a steal. Coffee, orange juice, shortbread, and a main dish for 10 bucks?! Count me in! # Compare and contrast - Out of all of the brunch places I've been (Aquitaine, Gaslight, Masa, Zaftig's, Stephi's), Gaslight has the best prixe fix menu. Aquitaine has a prixe fix menu too, but it's all omelets. Gaslight offers french toast! Gaslight is the only one with really nice outdoor seating for the summer. # Wait time- Wait time is never too bad. Actual waiting time is usually less than what they tell you. Going a little bit earlier is good though to beat the crowds if you can.# Ambience- The outdoor seating is great on a clear day. There's a collar of green grass that surrounds the below-ground-level outdoor seating; you forget you're right below a parking lot!

The best part of our experience at Gaslight was our bartender Mark.

It was super garlicky which I loved. Drinks - I had their cocktail special (I forgot the name) but had gin and a French liquor. Drink was OK, it wasn't as smooth as I wanted it to be. At least they used Hendricks as the gin as I had requested. Main entree - I had the steak frites since I wanted to know what the hype was all about and my boyfriend had the tuna. My steak was cooked perfectly as I wanted which was medium rare but it wasn't anything spectacular. The quality isn't anything awesome so don't expect aged prime rib-eye. I really hated the fries! It was cold and too salty. The tuna was quite bland in my opinion but the ratatouille underneath the tuna was delicious. Dessert - Creme Brulee was okay to me but my boyfriend disliked it.

This restaurant offers outdoor dining (albeit next to their parking lot) and a cool casual bar and lounge/dining area. If you can't find gaslight, its also the same place where the food trucks flock to every sunday en masse, to cater to the Bostonians constant need for food truck food.When I went, I made reservations, however the weather was so hot I guess it scared everyone away from dining inside (from the wonderful AC) and into the great melting outdoors. I prefer to know I am enjoying the food in the heat it is supposed to be eaten, as opposed to feeling like I am working out and sweating to just taste it. \u00a0I don't like to keep seasoning the food throughout the course of my meal, watching my sweat drip into whatever I eat. I was seated in a nice booth area, which had its own cool old-fashioned lamp light that I could turn on and off. The only problem was that the booth itself was made like a park bench, so comfort was not so great when sitting for longer than an hour there.Service was excellent, and knowledgeable, as it should be. The food was okay, but I think I made have ordered the wrong things. I had a charcuterie special appetizer but it was a pinch too salty and blubbery for my tastes. The mustard seeds however did help to neutralize some saltiness of the meats seasonings; but there wasn't enough bread or salad to compensate for the meats, which lead to me eating the meats on their own making sour faces. The escargot were scrum-diddily-umptious though, as I am always a fan of snails.The scallop entree was quite amazing, the size of them were to behold and to destroy quickly. They were quite firm on the outside and very tender in the middle. The ragu was quite nice as well and the seasoning wasn't too overpowering, which is nice to keep the natural flavors fresh on the palate. For dessert, I had gotten the chocolate lava balls with frosing. These were rather good, albeit a little dry. They looked like little munchkins, and you dunk them in a frosting sauce (which was the most delicious thing ever, I just wanted to drink it and look like a pig) for extra cavities and fun. Once bitten into, there is a ho fudge surprise that gushes into your mouth as you struggle to chew, swallow, and not choke at the same time. SUPER GOOD. I was so full when dessert came out but i still gobbled three balls down ( that doesn't sound right. . .)Overall, the experience was quite good and memorable, since this review is written almost 2 months after I had gone there.

I also came here for brunch once and glad I did because I found another reason not to come back. The brunch dish as expected was only okay, but the service was terrible!! Our waitress was nowhere to be found and pretty much the last place to look for her was under our table. When it came to my bill, she typed the wrong amount and instead of charging my portion of the bill which was $15 and not $45. She came back and asked us if it was okay for us to keep the charge on my card. You made a mistake so fix it, don't ask me to accommodate because you were busy picking your nose that your finger became too greasy and mistyped the charge. Maybe that was why she was MIA for 20 minutes during our meal? She voided the transaction and recharged my $15.The manager came to our table and told us she was sorry for the trouble and gave us each a $10 voucher for a future brunch...this made things better. A few days later, I checked my bank account and lo and behold my card was charged twice. I won't bore you with more details but you can imagine how annoyed I was.

Well.. There's a good story here, but Gaslight will always hold a special place in my Bostonian Heart.Years ago I stumbled in Gaslight with a friend after an evening at the First Friday Open Studios down the street. I had never heard if it and the decor seemed fancy-underground-Boston-cool. I felt like I had stepped into that random postmodern 20's speakeasy joint in the matrix. We sat, and looked at the menu. Aaawwww shoot. The menu was French dining.. Fancy.. Delicious looking.. But that evening we just wanted something like a burger. I was a little wine-tipsy and took a chance. I asked the waiter if by chance the chef had a burger that maybe wasn't on the menu. Eureka!! I was told that they had a budget on their late night bar menu!! \u00a0We both ordered our burgers and thanked the waiter for making this grand exception! (FYI- the late night bar menu at the time started at 11:30pm and served to 1:30!) When the burger arrives I was outrageously surprised. It was THE BEST burger I had tasted in all of Boston and Cambridge! Yes.. I'm a burger snob. Not just a snob... I savor the unique and interesting flavor profiles and store them away in my glorious burger eating memories. This burger was like a patty melt thing. I'm going to describe it now (preface: They don't actually serve this burger.. So this may be torture for you Bostonians looking for a good burger..I DO have my new favorites.)The bread was a grilled thick Texas toast style. Slightly crisp and cartelized with buttery French unapologetic goodness. Beneath the bread was a melted layer of gruyere with a hearty helping of caramelized onions. The burger was a delicious red meat. Not over seasoned, but seasoned perfectly to let the flavor of the meat be the clear highlight. The burger was served with a delicately crisp fries, and I added their spicy mustard.After we demolished the burgers and learned about this late night menu we vowed that Gaslight was our new late night burger spot.THAT was just my introduction. Over the course of the next year my friends and I would meet at the bar around midnight for the $9.00 burger and $2.00 PBR in the intimate and classic bar. The bartenders were always amazing and got to know us quickly.

Since then they have stopped the late night menu with the burger, so I don't go very often.. But I still Love it. I have my favorite drinks and menu items to share below:Drinks:Manhattan SidecarFood:French onion soup -YUMFried artichoke hearts - omg- addicting. Fa real.FriesCheese plate - it's surprisingly hard to find a good cheese plate in Boston.. When I say good I like good cheese choices (complex) and even better accompaniment choices in chutney, dark chocolates, honey, nuts, etc..) this was is pretty decent.Steak frittes - class goodie. Always my default if I am eating a real dinner there. Yes.. Creature of habit.So go here. Late at night.. When it isn't super crowded and you can get to know the people around you. This is a friendly local spot..

To start, there were only two in my party and we were intrigued by two items on the charcuterie board (the 18 month house-made prosciutto and the house-made pork rilletes). We knew we weren't going to be able to eat a whole board of charcuterie which included a bunch of other things, and our waiter was extremely accommodating in allowing us to choose just two and adjusting the price accordingly. The charcuterie program here, by the way, is top notch. With the exception of the speck, everything is made in-house.Throughout the meal, I always felt well attended to and cared for. Our waiter returned several times to check on us, but not in that annoying \"how's your meal\" way. I went for the onion soup with truffled short rib, which was probably the best iteration of that dish I've had in a while. Filled with onion, extremely aromatic, and the crouton clearly freshly crisped and not at all soggy, I knew I was poised for an excellent meal. My entree, duck confit with red rice and frisee salad, was excellent, and certainly one of the best duck legs I've had in Boston. My girlfriend's entree, a duo of filet mignon and short rib, was absolutely to die for. Everything about that dish, from the contrast of textures and flavors in between the two cuts of meat to the garlic saut\u00e9ed spinach was extremely impressive.We finished with a molten chocolate cake, which came compliments of the house due to the celebration of my girlfriend's birthday.

The menu is very simple. There is a special for each day of the week. There was an additional special that day and some of my friends ordered that. It was pasta with short rib, squash, and olives. The portion size was really small. I ordered the steak frites and escargot for my appetizer. It would be more exotic if they actually left the escargot in the shell.

I think less sauce would have let the true flavor of the snail come through, but again, I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed that.I got the Pan Roasted Cod with Mussels and Chorizo and my boyfriend got the Duck Plat du Jour. The cod's sauce was savory and creamy - save room for the sauce-infused baguette pieces under the cod. The dish was perfect, although a few more pieces of chorizo would have been appreciated. The duck was crispy and tender, although the leg was a bit dry. Or perhaps that's normal? I never eat duck so...yeah...the portions were also very generous and we were comfortably full.I had the Madame Lillet, which tastes like a sophisticated sangria.

Gaslight, thank you for giving me the inspiration and motivation to want to run home and tell my fellow yelper's just how great your food and service was! Everything was perfect, down to the last detail.As good as my entree was, I have to say first and foremost that I had the best steak tartare I've ever had in Boston! I was feeling nostalgic while I ate it because I realized that once I finished this masterpiece of a dish, that was it, it would be gone forever, never to return. The moment eventually came, I finished my plate, and kissed my last bite goodbye. Thank you steak tartare for that special moment in my life, I will never forget you. You brought me so much joy and happiness, even if it was only for those 5 precious minutes you spent on my plate. Seriously though, it was so good I was considering ordering another as my dessert. ------Service and Wine----Our server Arianna was one of the best waitresses we've had in a while. My wife and I \u00a0were both unsure if we wanted to go with a medium/full bodied CabS, a medium Syrah or a lighter Pinot Noir. Arianna told us not to worry and came back with a flight of 3 different wines for us to sample. She included a Pinot Noir which I ended up selecting, and my wife chose the Syrah. \u00a0It was just a very nice gesture to be able to taste the three different wines we were considering before selecting.--------FOOD--------I narrowed my appetizer selection to 3 and my entree selection to 3 and Arianna once again came through with some awesome recommendations. If my eyes were choosing for me they would have selected the French Onion soup with loads of cheese oozing from the sides, but instead I went with the steak tartare. Wifey had the shaved beet salad, it was very tasty with a nice presentation.Entrees she had the pan roasted cod with mussels, oysters, and other goodies. The look on her face when she took a bite was like a baseball player who just hit a grandslam. When I tried it I almost got plate envy, but my duck confit was so good that this feeling of envy quickly went away.For dessert we had the chocolate beignets and these were spectacular little fritters with melted chocolate oozing from within. A little creme anglaise to dip them in made it the perfect finishing touch. \u00a0Dinner was over and I was still thinking about the steak tartare. Overall, a very delicious dinner, exceptional service and great wine selection. --------PRICES--------We were at Hammersley's Bistro last week and when comparing the food and the prices, we spent 1.5 times more at Hammersley's for the same quality and taste in food. The prices at Gaslight are VERY fair! For food, prices and exceptional service, I have to give Gaslight 5 stars. If I could give them 6 stars, I would, because their Steak Tartare is too die for!

I was able to make reservations on Open Table earlier in the day with no problem. The restaurant had a nice relaxed feel to it. The lighting was dim but not too dark. Then we were seated right in front of the kitchen door. I wasn't expecting that. Unfortunately the place looked pretty packed so we couldn't try changing our seats. For appetizers we ordered the Steak Tartare and half a dozen oysters. I thought the Steak Tartare was pretty good. It had an over medium egg on top. It gave a nice balance. It also had capers, which I like but thought they were too salty (pickled?) for me. After a couple bites I had to pick them out. The oysters were really good, unfortunately I forgot the name of the two types we had. My mistake was trying the vinegar sauce with one of the oysters, it was too overpowering for me and I couldn't taste the oyster at all. It was just texture at that point. The second one I had with just lemon and I liked just like that.I ordered the Pan Roasted Cod with mussels, oysters and Spanish chorizo for my main dish. All of the seafood was really fresh! The cod was cooked perfectly. The mussels were nice and plump. The sauce had a subtle spice to it that was really addicting. I used the complimentary baguette to soak up all the sauce. The menu said there was oysters in there as well but I don't remember getting any. My friend ordered the Sauteed skate with french beans, roasted potatoes & caper brown butter. The skate was very moist and full of the butter flavor. It was really good but I don't think I could finish the whole thing because of the butter. We ordered the Mousse au Chocolat with Orange & Almond Tuiles to share. The tuile was crunchy and the mousse was nice and creamy. It was a great combination with the homemade cream.

They were so accommodating. The staff signed a cute little birthday card for her, they put a candle in one of the desserts (without any of us asking them to). Small yet nice touches.

And then on top of that.....Food: I don't mind paying more for delicious, high quality, large amount of food. This food really want anything I couldn't have had at one of my friends or family's houses. Probably the best thing was the soup which I forget what kind it was and it was like a pur\u00e9e of an orange vegetable. The flavor and consistently was very yummy. Other than that, I hot a chicken and fries dish that was bland, small, and overly oily. I can't believe they wanted to charge me what they did for food that wasn't even that good (not to mention it took all night to get to me). Needless to say I was very frustrated and disappointed. The entire experience was ordinary at best. Disappointing and frustrating at worst. Not worth my money or time.

The food is scrumptious, the decor is pure brasserie French and the cocktails meet my very high expectations as a cocktail fiend (who's easily fascinated by pretty colors and exotic names).Let's start with brunch: Without a doubt, get the Croque Monsieur. It's a breakfast sandwich served with ham, gruyere cheese, bechamel and a side of skinny fries (the only way the French like their fried potatoes, you see). (The Croque Madame is the same thing but with a fried egg on top. Ovarian jokes aside--Really? The female one comes with an egg??--I prefer the Monsieur because I'm not a huge fan of fried eggs, but if you like them, you could just as well go with the Madame for $1.50 more.) This sandwich is just delicious--always perfectly toasted with just the right amount of saltiness and savoriness from the various ingredients without any one being overwhelming.I once came with the boyfriend and he had the caramelized banana crepes (I swear, he'd have M&Ms for breakfast, he's got such a sweet tooth). I definitely prefer salty dishes but the crepes were quite delicious. The only problem was that they didn't give very much in terms of portion size. Three rather small, thin crepes is not enough to feed a tall, growing boy with a bottomless sweet-loving stomach. Luckily, we filled up on some wonderfully soft Pain au Chocolat beforehand, so he wasn't too badly off. Well, he also tricked me into looking the other way at a \"pretty cocktail\" and stole some of my fries...Even though I said he could take as much as he wanted!Another time, a friend of mine ordered Oeufs Poche Bigneronne. I sampled some and was amazed at how delicious it was. I love mushrooms like Joan Rivers loves plastic surgery and this dish was incredible. The red wine sauce was so savory when cooked with the mushrooms! If I hadn't been so enthralled by my Croque Monsieur, I probably would have changed my order to that!Cocktails, cocktails, cocktails: The signature Fleur de Lis is hands down my FAVORITE cocktail in all of Boston. Served in a large martini glass (as Goldilocks would say, \"just right\"), it's composed of gin, Parfait Amour Violet Liqueur, peach liqueur, white grape juice and a champagne float. Or, for the superficial cocktail drinker (like me), it's a beautiful lavender color and tastes like sweet perfection. Seriously, this cocktail is perfect. The mimosa and Matin Martini are also perfect complements to brunch. MM is sunny yellow and tastes like citrus. Very delicious. For dinner, get the smoked salmon to start. The Duck Confit comes with a surprising citrus/orange twist that really enhances the flavor. The Rotisserie Chicken, while nothing terribly inventive, is fall-off-the-bone tender. The Steak Frites is classic and I love the butter. Finally, to complete your meal, I recommend the Creme Brulee or Chocolate Beignets. The latter feels more New Orleans than France, but they're hot, crisp and just delicious. As for the decor, you really can't go wrong sitting inside or outside. I love the spacious patio but I also love the indoor, Moulin Rouge-esque, heavy red meets black & white bathroom tiles look. Feels very Parisian brasserie.

I'd give Gaslight 4.5 if that were the case, but I'm stingy with all 5. That said, this place has been good to me - great even. The food is consistently fantastic. And your wallet won't cringe when your meal comes to a close. It's fine for an intimate night out and can also host large parties at wonderful farm-style tables holding 12+. I like that about this place. I've eaten here a LOT, but I keep coming back to my mainstays, so I'm pushy in my suggestions (it's only b/c I've tried the majority of the menu)... For the first course, you should eat French Onion Soup (especially if it's cold out), Escargots (trust me, I never thought I'd point you there either), or the Shaved Beet Salad (warning: it's truly just beets - delicious, wonderful JUST beets - don't want lettuce). Then, because you could decide between a first course and the oysters, get a few oysters. They're delicious here. So briny and wonderful. Two should do the trick.For dinner, you'll likely be happy with whatever your choice, but for me, the Moules Frites and Steak Frites duel it out every time. If you're smart, convince your companion to order whichever you don't choose. The mussels have this fantastic sauce, so don't be shy about asking for another loaf of bread that you already gobbled up. It's necessary for those mussels. And for the Steak - go Med-Rare and with Bearnaise (they'll put it in a little gravy boat on the side - not to worry, your steak won't be served swimming in sauce). If for some reason you deviate from these dishes, at least heed this: ORDER POMMES FRITES. Okay? Trust me, your $4.50 will thank me. For wine? The Lilly Pad Pinot Noir is a surprising choice for the value. The service has been fine - a few times much less than fine, but the spotty issues I've had have been cured with a manager's touch and subsequent visits leaving me happy as a clam (or briny oyster).

One is enough for you both.\" OOOOOOOkay. \u00a0Embarassing (as the tables are so close together that other diners heard this and snickered) and a bit unprofessional, but suit yourself. \u00a0I will just ask for another bread in 20 minutes.The fondue came and was a skillet with what looked like one thin sheet of cheese on it that had been melted, and 3 sticks of toasted bread. \u00a0The cheese had no flavor of its own and took on the flavor of the onion it was cooked with, and for $9.75, i expected something more substantial or at least something more flavorful. \u00a0For my money, I wouldn't order it again. \u00a0I'd go with the $6+ fried mussels that have a bit more bang and flavor for the buck.For entrees, we ordered the steak frites MEDIUM RARE and the tuna dish that came on a plate with pita, hummus, blanched haricots verts, some kimchee/sourkraut/pickled item. and hard boiled eggs.My steak came out well-done. \u00a0If i'd ordered medium-well, i would understand how they may have overcooked it a couple seconds...however, i ordered a medium rare steak (bloody) and i got one charred (no sign of pink at all inside). \u00a0I finally flagged down the server (as i said, it was really busy here, even at this point at 9:30pm) to get a new steak. \u00a0Had it been medium or medium-well, I just would have eaten it by this point, but with no pink to be seen, i was a bit disappointed. \u00a0I sent the steak back to be re-done medium-rare, and the manager that night brought me a new one personally a few minutes later, apologizing profusely, which i appreciated. \u00a0Whomever the manager on staff that night was, he was extremely personable and diffused an annoying situation with grace, poise, and care. \u00a0He was fantastic and he totally saved my meal. On to the food: \u00a0the steak (they use sirloin) was a bit chewy to cut, but with the medium-rare cook, it did melt in my mouth and was tasty. \u00a0The bernaise it is served with has a nice flavor, but a bit runny for my taste. \u00a0I enjoy bernaise a bit more viscous than what they serve, but that is purely a personal preference, and the restaurant is not to be faulted for that. \u00a0The fries, as always, are stellar.My date had the seared tuna dish, and the tuna was pretty decent, albeit just a tad bland. \u00a0The sear was nice, though, and the inside was a nice, vibrant red, the quality of the fish very high. \u00a0The accompaniments to the tuna were OK but unremarkable by-and-large. \u00a0The kimchee/saurkraut-type \"stuff\" was really pungent, strong, and intrusive to my pallete, but again, personal preference. \u00a0I find that kind of taste very polarizing, and my boyfriend agreed, but that's just us. \u00a0I am not sure what that sort of thing is supposed to taste like, so it could have been spot-on for all I know. \u00a0The haricots verts were unseasoned and just seemed steamed and laid on the plate - i would have preferred a bit more seasoning. \u00a0The pita was squishy and nice, and the hard boiled egg was, well, a hard boiled egg.I didn't LOVE either dish, and in the future I would go back to my moules frites if I ever ate here again.I gave it a second try, the service was still inattentive, and the snafu with the steak preparation, the woman telling me that one bread was enough, and the constant flagging down servers to get my water filled will keep me from coming back.", "Date": "2010-02-28", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Sarah S.", "ReviewID": "Fe3mBtdLpOYpCy0cqMJqhg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Gaslight exceeded our expectations.

Yet unlike the scene in Pretty Woman came without shells or Richard Gere.The Tuesday night plate du jour was scallops wrapped in bacon with a warm apple compote. But all the shellfish of the night had me swayed to the rotisserie chicken, brimming with juices and perfectly cooked, nestled between amazing herbed frites.

I'm not the biggest fan of brunching at more-than-dirtcheap places. a) Restaurants always put the B-team kitchen staff on Sunday mornings. Why? Because the A-team worked late on Saturday night, the busiest night of the week, and they want to give their good cooks a rest. b) Even the nicey-nice expensive places serve the same stuff you can get at a diner ... eggs, bacon, toast, sandwiches, salads ... for 3.5x the price.

The size would have been fine if it hadn't been overpowered by a ridiculously-sweet vanilla creme inside that pushed the boundaries of good taste. It tasted plain-old bad at times. When scraped out, the toast was fine. My companion's crepe was good, if small again, but not as overpowered by accompaniments.

Once they came we were ready to order. Mostly everyone got an appetizer and entree. I chose the fondue and bar steak. There were 2 choices of steak on the menu..steak frites..then the bar steak. I asked the server which one was better..he said he preferred the bar steak cause it was a better cut, although a bit smaller then the other. Both came with frites Appetizers arrived. Lots of people got the onion soup. I tried an oyster and fried mussel that were good. Then I had my fondue. It came in a cast iron skillet with 3 bread sticks. It was very rich, definitely meant for sharing. I didn't pick up much sausage in it though. I shared it with a few people at the table. In between food coming and going we had some waits for drinks. Then as the place cleared out, they started to pick up service at our table. The Fleur de lis cocktail was great. It wasn't pink as described though. Dinner arrived for all. Time to dig in. My steak was good, although it was more rare then med-rare. It was a very small piece that I ended up eating it as is. Very tender and juicy. The frites on the side were just ok. They were a little salty and plain. They could of used a toss in some seasoning. The portion sizes are small, hence, the prices are not too steep. Most entrees were between $16-$21. Time for dessert came around...Only a few people opted for something. Since it was a birthday a small molten cake with a candle was brought out with ice cream for the birthday boy. I of course had some and liked it. So all around an OK experience. Our server was nice, they were slamming for the first part of our meal so towards the mid-end we were able to really get taken care of. The restaurant is very Parisian.

Couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars, decided to round up. A lot of the reviews here speak quite accurately to the decor here. Its nice, fancy, and can be considered romantic while still completely comfortable for a group of friends or family. The table service here was attentive without being overbearing. But really, its the food here that earns it high marks and return business. Gaslight takes the brunch menu that you'll find across town and puts a unique french twist on it. And it works. And works very well. Highlights include the Poached Eggs Vigneronne, which was a step away from what I usually look for in my brunch dish but ended up being quite delicious, and the Truffled Scrambled Egg Tartine, which my friends seemed to thoroughly enjoy. In fact, my friends and I enjoyed our brunch so much, we decided to move over to the bar and enjoy some more time at Gaslight. Luckily, our good service and delicious food carried over from brunch to the bar. \u00a0Our bartender, Henry, was fantastic. He was personable, unintrusive, and had some great recommendations. The appetizers and sides we had at the bar were great too, especially the fries. The drink list here was extensive, varied, and quite delicious. They had an impressive selection of both liquors and beers. You really can't go wrong. All in all, we had a great time at both brunch and at the bar afterwards.

To top it off, my friend and I split the chocolate beignets for dessert over a petit noisette (on second thought, forget the saltines and just go for the water). Every now and then you need to treat yourself and this felt like the perfect choice to do just that - if that doesn't convince you, the check will: cocktail + entree + split dessert + coffee came in just under $40 a person.

I would first off like to thank Jeffrey for this attentiveness and responsiveness to some of the concerns that I wrote about in my previous review. A second visit to Gaslight with the same group of friends found me at a loss for words about how drastically better my experience there was. Seated on their beautiful patio this time around, we were in high hopes for a better experience and were treated to both a wonderful meal and experience there. First off, the drinks. My manhattan was perfect and quite refreshing considering how hot it was outside. The waiter \u00a0dropped off some bread and ran through the specials, one of them being their poutine. Three of us at the table had been to Montreal just a few months prior to our visit at Gaslight and we voted for it; why the hell not. Devouring the dish would sell it short. We plowed through it and it disappeared in about 15 seconds flat. Shame and guilt could be seen on our faces at the delicious plate probably contained a weeks worth of calories. Oh well, it was worth it.For my entree I settled for the tagliatelle pasta dish, which came with cured ham, figs, apricots and bucheron cheese. The combination gave some pretty amazing depth to the dish and it was delicious up to the very last forking. I truly enjoyed myself and the dish was refreshing, especially on a hot summer day. It seemed very seasonal and appropriate to have such unusual ingredients on my plate . I was happy and satisfied, and so were my other three companions.Returning to Gaslight had given me a new perspective on what they are trying to do at this restaurant. Bringing both French fare and seasonal ingredients to customers for an affordable price. The decor is very authentic, the food pretty damn good and it's affordable which is a rarity since most French restaurants are upscale and excruciatingly expensive. And they also have free parking, which is a big plus. And best of all, the owners really care which is something that I have acknowledge and considered which writing this review and it's nice to see them strive for a higher level of service.

The raspberry part of the crumb cake was so unbelievably sweet, I found it almost inedible. Both my friend and I didn't finish. Did the chef get a little sugar happy?! Well, it certainly did the job of waking me up because it tasted so bad.We both ordered omelettes with carmelized onions and potatoes. I know omelettes are a cinch to make but they came out SO quickly that I suspected they'd been made well ahead of time. And I was right. They definitely had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least an hour. It really tasted like airplane food (when they used to serve real food on airplanes): rubbery omelette egg, soggy soggy potatoes and mushy, mushy onions. Maybe some cheese in there that had turned so rubbery, it tasted like the egg. The only good part was the surprise fries that came with the omelette. Those were good but then again, it's hard to mess up fries.I'm sad to say I won't be back.

It has a very rustic french brasserie style. It's halfway underground. I found the train station bench chairs to be a bit uncomfortable but nonetheless it suited the concept. We were seated in the lounge area at 9:00pm. I think it's because they were getting ready to shut down the dining area. We were seated right next to a party of six. Literally right next to them. I felt cramped and on top of them but I figured the other empty table next to us was reserved. But no, it sat there empty all night. Oh well.We started off with some cocktails which were not too bad. The madame lillet cocktail is great if you like sweet cocktails. I then switched to a sparkling blanc de blanc which was pretty tasty.The charcuterie plate was pretty tasty. My boyfriend got the house salad which I thought was dressed perfectly and actually felt healthy eating that salad. The main course was good. I was in the mood for some steak so I got the bar steak (at $22, a bargain!). My boyfriend got the pork chop which I actually liked better. I do have to say that the chocolate beignets were to die for. Chocolate doughnut-holes made to order with a hot oozy chocolate center and an awesome dipping sauce.Would I recommend this place? Yes, definitely if you're in to the rustic french fare. There's a bunch of stuff that I wanted to try but I forgot that this is 2013 and I'm on a stricter diet.

She came back one more time before she had an answer. It did not. It was good. I liked it, a decent way to start out a brunch. One of my sisters got earl grey tea which she thought was good, came in an individual tea pot, cutesy. My other sister and I got coffees. They got: Vanilla French Toast with blueberry compote on the side, and Omelette Lyonnaise (sp?) with french fries on the side. The french toast was a single slice of bread which was too sweet to finish, and the fries were probably the best part of the omelette.

We had pate to start -- not the best I've ever had, but for $8, it was a good-sized portion and the accompanying baguettes were great. Main course was duck confit with a light orange sauce, which was just delicious (though I am a big duck fan, and you can't go too wrong there).

These little guys were better than any \"chocolate lava cake\" I've had at any other restaurant in Boston, including Finale. One of my friends had a sorbet trio, which -- rather than the standard melon/mango/whatever trio -- included flavors like apple cider and rhubarb.

Three courses for $33.11 including a complimentary glass of wine! Yes, please! I'm a huge fan or Merlot and the Chateau Abbaye de Saint-Ferme did not disappoint!

You could definitely taste the flavors and the spinach was amazingly fresh. Delicious!For my main course I had the tagliatell with rock shrimp, sweet tomatoes, basil pistou and cantal fondue. I thought it would be much more cheesier than it was. It was definitely tasty although a bit over powered with garlic. Dessert left a bit to be desired. The strawberry layer cake tasted a bit off to me. It's a rarity I don't finish dessert and I didn't finish this one.

We all know Boston is anemic when it comes to good late-night options, and Gaslight provides a much needed haven for the night owl craving food at 2 am OTHER than greasy pizza in Allston, surrounded by a bunch of bros vomiting all over their Ed Hardy shirts. And as far as their late night food goes, this place has, honestly, one of the best hamburgers in the city. Juicy ground beef with melted gruyere cheese, served with a house-made mustard blend, and grilled between two slices of thick-cut brioche. It is to. die. for. And at around 8 bucks, it's a total steal. But it's one of those things that you can only get after midnight on their late-night-menu.Finally, their 2 dollar PBR. Yeah, it's not a great beer, but they do their best to gussy it up, serving it in a lean, sexy frosted glass, and you're paying dive-bar prices at a location that's anything but. Go there, split a dozen oysters with a friend, get a few beers, and you've had a great night for an affordable price. So do yourself a favor and go there at 1 am. The bartenders are all nice, they'll take care of you. And get a hamburger. And get a PBR. And pay the 10 dollars this meal has cost you (not including tip, which you will do generously).

Since I'd already had dinner with my boyfriend before the show at Au Bon Pain (another fancy French restaurant in the Boston area...hah), we resolved only to go to Gaslight for dessert. Upon reading the menu, however, it was impossible not to try some appetizers as well.The food was passable. Nothing extraordinary. For late-night appetizers, we ordered a fondue and the escargot (sparking the retelling of one of Peter's favorite jokes involving a snail, a sports car, and vanity plates). The fondue came in a shallow cast iron dish that had no continual heat source, so after the first few minutes the cheese had hardened and was difficult to scoop out with the long, toasted croutons. The escargot was exactly what I'd expected: lots of butter, parsley, and garlic. The real star, as it were, turned out to be the house bread; served warm, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, it turned out to be the perfect complement to the fondue and the leftover butter in each escargot foxhole (what, you didn't think I was going to waste that, did you?).The standout on this visit was the tarte tatin, which was served warm with vanilla ice cream. The apples had a gooey-ness to them, and the flavor was sweet without being syrupy and tart without being sour. The molten chocolate cake was forgettable.Above all, I love the ambience at Gaslight. Tiled floors, tiled walls, Bacardi bottles lining the molding, and those horrifyingly frustrating little water glasses that they insist on using in Europe: it was all very transportive to a more romantic time and slower pace of life in Paris. Other reviews I'd read commented on the noisiness of the place; the high ceilings certainly helped with the acoustics, but I didn't think it was any louder than was reasonable for a late night bistro-bar.Prices were quite reasonable.

I avoid the communal tables as best I can though on Friday evening (at like 9PM with no reservations) the communal table is the best you'll get.Price-- amazing. For $10 bucks you will receive the most incredible steak tartare you have ever put your lips to. It's light, juicy raw beef topped with a tiny little fried quail egg and creme fraiche and fresh juicy little capers served with 5-6 pieces of toasty baguette. Food-- stunning. My friends & I love: haricot verts (as a starter, way better than the beet root salad too purple), steak tartare (of course), the fondue (stinky cheese and proscuitto on a sizzling black ceramic plate), the mussels are delicious if they're made to order right.

Drinks: I always get a Pimms Cup though their recipe changed over the summer and when I was there a fortnight ago they ditched it on their menu completely. Fleur de Lis is gray colored, very light, very delicious vodka based martini. I also like the Grape 9 Fizz (also taken off the menu recently) it has soaked grapes at the bottom, I can't recall what liquer its infused with.

C'est vachement magnifique! Gaslight does French right, in my opinion. Starting with the decor, it doesn't do it over the top like some others. The floor is beautifully tiled, the walls lined with dark wood and pictures, and the coup-de-grace: several rows of anise-flavored liqueur bottles on high shelves in the main room. The menu is a wonderful mix of traditional French fare and French-inspired twists. They bring each table a mini baguette to start the meal, and boy, is it wonderful. The best part is that you rip off a piece for yourself just as the French would at home. The tea-towel napkins are a nice touch, as well.You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't order the Assiette de Fromages. It comes with bucheron, cantal(if I recall correctly), and a blue that slips my memory, but the real reason to get it is for the heavenly toasted brioche it comes with. The goat cheese pairs so perfectly with the brioche, you will order it every time you go back (I have...).For my plat principal, I've had the croque monsieur both times I've gone, because I have a particular affection for them. It's not the best croque I've ever had (though it's not a fair competition: my favorite was in France), but it's darned close. The bread is cut thick and crunchy the way it should be. The ham is a decent thickness but not the ham-steak you wind up with at some places. The bechamel... oh the bechamel. I haven't put my finger on it yet, but it tastes exactly like the ones in France. It's creamy, nutmegy, and in general delicious. The frites on the side are a perfect touch: salty, crispy, and dangerously addictive. Of course with all perfect foods, there's a caveat. The croque monsieur's is its immobilizing richness. If you're a light eater, I would suggest splitting it.And dessert... definitely try the chocolate beignets. They're fascinating: like unsweetened chocolate donut holes on the outside with brownie batter on the inside. Add some sweetness by dipping them in creme anglais (which goes well alone on a spoon as well...). The one disappointment I had was the molten chocolate cake.

I barely finished my meal, it was the perfect amount of food. My friend's meal was delicious as well. The service was great- my water glass never made it to empty before it was refilled, and the waitress was efficient and checked in at the right times. The whole meal only took about an hour (but it didn't feel rushed). We left happy, full, and with no complaints.

The croque-madame was also very good. \u00a0The egg on top was cooked over-medium so the yolk was just slightly runny--which I'm a fan of. \u00a0The frites it came with were very crisp and done near-perfectly as well.

I have not eaten French food for 17 years. The last time I ate one was when I was 10 years old and visiting Paris. At that time, I didn't know much anything about fine dining until now. Hearing about this restaurant piqued my interest. The setting, food, and beverage selection was great and very affordable. I indulged myself a bit because I wanted to live a good life and broaden my tastes for a foreign fine dining experience.  The setting isn't too upscale, but in between with a mildly dimmed lighting inside of the restaurant and energetic noise flowing in the joint, it's not too dark or loud for me to communicate with my friends (I'm Deaf). It's like being in Paris a little bit and I recalled the night in Paris just like that when I went there as a kid. It's a place for people from middle and high class, but I felt comfortable going in without worrying about how well I have to dress and so on.Wine selection is pretty decent and affordable. I was able to order a glass of '05 Pinot Merlot and it was damn delicious one I ever drank. It's dry, a bit of fruity, reasonably strong, and aromatic. Just for $7.95 or something like that. My meal was really delicious. I ordered an appetizer of escargots and a bar steak with frites dish. Escargots were great (I never had one in my life) and very savory with butter, herbs, and garlic. You can dip a piece of fresh baked French bread and dip the sauce from it. It's an epic delish! Bar steak with frites wasn't too tough and the sauce on the top of it was very sweet, and a bit of creamy-wise. Everything from the dish went so well with my mouth and stomach. I definitively order this again whenever I visit there. But I am willing to try other dishes. =)The service was decent. My server was very attentive and informative about the dinner's specials, alcoholic beverages, and so on. She was very clear and I could read her lips well. Also, she ensured that we were satisfied with her service and our foods. If anyone want to try out a French culinary experience, I would start with Gaslight because it's the most delicious and affordable joint.", "Date": "2010-09-19", "Author_Location": "Newton Highlands, MA"}, {"Author": "SR M.", "ReviewID": "sRMI9dSntEk7LlkFXyzUHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I haven't been in awhile but from I can remember, the bread was delicious.

It surprises me how many restaurants these days don't cook a decent medium rare steak, but Gaslight definitely isn't one of them. My friend who had the steak frites thought the quality of the meat was great but because the cut was leaner than he'd prefer, it lacked flavor.

I don't know how to provide a proper review that justifies the great experience we had here!1. Parking. The lot is literally right next to the the building...and FREE. Seriously, what else can you ask for when you are in the city?2. Ambiance. It's a lot larger than I expected, yet you don't lose the romantic feel of the place. If you're looking for a nice evening out with some wine, dim lights, and lots of love, this is the perfect place. When we arrived at 6:30pm, the place was pretty empty, but at 8pm, all the seats were full and the place was really lively. Loved it!3. Food. Crab fondue was very tasty for an appetizer. The garlic soup with mussels was enjoyable, though I didn't like that they put the bread in the soup, which sucked everything up. The duck confit was so tender and flavourful, though the garlic potatoes side was just okay, and the greens were kinda salty. Surprisingly, I was not a fan of the chocolate beignets. The were just warm donuts with chocolate sauce in the middle. Kinda meh.4. Drinks. I had the Madame something, which was recommended by our server. It was strong and sweet, just how i liked it. I got two and felt pretty drunk.5. Service. Our server was friendly, attentive, and a pleasure to have around. She also split everything we ordered into two for us, which was very sweet of her.6. Price. 5-10 dollars per appetizer, 15-20 dollars per entree (including sides). Definitely a fantastic meal that doesn't break your wallet.

(Hey, even if they don't have eggs benedict, they have an omelet Lyonnaise which is fantastic, a killer croque madame, and the wonderful oeufs vigneronne which I tend towards because I can't replicate it at home, which I can easily do with eggs benedict, omelets, and croque madames.) They also have mostly gin drinks on their cocktail list, and I just hate gin. They have a full bar, though, so don't let that keep you at home.Food-wise, I have never had an off experience at Gaslight. Eggs are always poached well. Frites are always amazing. Chicken is always juicy. Bread is always crusty. Drinks are exactly as described. Service issues (which have been infrequent) are taken care of promptly and, well, let's just say that the staff at Gaslight goes over and above in the service department. You have a problem, and they take care of it, apologize, and make sure you want to return. Seriously. They could get a five star rating based on their ability to handle complaints alone.Atmosphere-wise, it can get pretty loud at peak times (and there's not much to dampen the noise). It's not really a comfy-sink-in-your-seat-relax-and-enjoy-your-meal place. Off-peak, it's a lot quieter, so I tend to opt for the off-peak times. If you're unsure about going -- go. Oh, to cap off this review, I have to include a story: one fine sunny Sunday in June, after hours of pup-play and walking, a friend and I happened past Gaslight's patio which was open and inviting. We asked if our canine friend could sit with us on the patio and they were able to seat us at the edge so she could sit just outside the area, and they provided her with a container of water and we were able to enjoy glasses of sangria as the heat of the afternoon let up. To me, that's the perfect South End experience: sitting on a restaurant patio, drinking sangria, and watching the view.

We made a reservation on Open Table, and were seated right away at a small table in the middle of the dining room. Normally that type of seating arrangement isn't my favorite, but the tables were far enough away from each other, and the music was at just the right volume so that we didn't feel as though we were either eavesdropping or being listened in on.Once seated, I honed in on Gaslight's cocktail menu and ordered an \"Alexandropolitan\"-- Berkshire Mountain gin, ginger liqueur, grapefruit, and lime. It was excellent-- well-balanced, and not too sweet or sugary, like some grapefruit cocktails can be. Later in the meal, I had a chance to check out the wine menu as well, and had a really nice (and reasonably priced) glass of what I think was a grenache-syrah blend (but it doesn't look like their wine menu is online, so I can't say for sure).The shaved beet salad was also fantastic. Beet salads are a dime a dozen (though I'm not complaining), but this particular preparation was quite different, and it was without question the best I've had. The beets were served either raw or slightly cooked (I couldn't tell exactly which), and shredded into a huge, delicious beet dome. (I was going to go with \"pile,\" but \"dome\" sounds slightly more appetizing.) They were very lightly tossed with a dijon dressing, and served with toasted walnuts. Even my beet-phobic husband loved it, and I'd recommend it as a gateway beet dish (I said it) for people who don't like the texture or sweetness of roasted beets. The tuna with polenta, roasted mushrooms and turnips was likewise excellent. The fish was perfectly seared on the outside and rare inside, and the savory accompaniments were complemented by a delicious port wine sauce. We shared a lemon tart of some sort, which I don't think is on the regular menu. It was served with candied lemon pieces, and not surprisingly, it was great as well. Because we couldn't get enough, we also ordered from Gaslight's extensive coffee menu at the end of our meal. (You know, for the full Parisian cafe effect...)Our waitress was very friendly, and the service was consistently good throughout our meal.

Chevre & Ricotta Ravioli: Absolutely delicious. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Creamy and rich and exactly the right amount on my plate.

Well, I can confirm that the positive reviews are in fact true, and put a personal spin on everything... so here I go.My boyfriend and I recently moved north from Annapolis MD, a strange little racially/economically segregated town of a state capital home to a few good restaurants and a whole lot of boats. We now live in Allston, which a, we can afford, b, is home to lovely cheap ethnic restaurants, c, people our age. After a while, however, we needed to escape from all the damn hipsters and we missed having something a litter fancier around. We wanted excellent old-fashioned French food, to throw back a few tasty cocktails, and generally surround ourselves with well-dressed attractive people without completely breaking the piggy bank. Finding ourselves downtown-ish and having read many good reviews, we decided to give this place a try, and it scored highly on all these fronts (except we ended up splurging and breaking the piggy bank anyway, though we could have not done so in theory, at least)!The menu was a perfect mix of the trendy -- skate and shaved beet salads -- and the laid-back classics -- Duck Confit and delicious baugettes. The Entrees came with delicious salty French fries. I ordered the onion soup (solid, but the only thing we ordered not really worth writing home about) and the rotisserie chicken, which came falling off the bone and cooked with mustard, creating delectable jus. My bf took the beet salad w. creme fraiche (perfectly balanced the creaminess of the the creme fraiche w. the sharpness of dijon and the sourness of vinagrette and the sweetness of the beets and the crunchiness of walnuts) and the steak frite w. perfect maitre'd butter (we tasted garlic, parsley, and watercress[?]), which he finished in a matter of seconds. We finished with the creme brulee -- hardly exotic, but extremely satisfying.The cocktails were literally among the best of my life. I tried the madame lilliet (sweet goodness), while my bf had the Fleur de Lis (we always try each others orders to see who chose better -- and we often disagree, but he honestly won this one hands down; this thing is perfect!) and the Le Jardin (which comes with dill leaves suspended in it!) We had intended to be frugal, and while nothing was overpriced -- we've had far inferior food for more -- we ended up spending $55 a person somehow (so much for not breaking the piggy-bank)!Final notes: a bit on the loud side, but nothing too bad.

After some furious yelp review reading, I decided this place was a winner, and boy was I right (thanks for the great reviews fellow Yelpers)!What really won me over was the atmosphere - beautiful restaurant (and bar), which sits comfortably in its location in South End, by the abandoned-looking market building in the back, surrounded by quiet buildings and art galleries. The whole place just works well together, inside and out (save the gym next door, but just shield your eyes and its like its not really there).The food itself was delicious, I had scrumptiously-prepared roast lamb chops on a bed of mashed potatoes. The asparagus appetizer which came topped with unexpected anchovies was a bit odd, but good nonetheless. I was mostly disappointed with the glass of Malbec I ordered, which tasted more bitterly-sour than other Malbecs I've had, but I'm not going let that ruin a good dining experience. The after-dinner coffee was great too.As others have mentioned, they did seem a tad bit understaffed - our waitress at the table wasn't as attentive as I would've liked, and getting a drink at the bar seemed more work than it had to be, even though it wasn't a packed night.

It's also fun to be a few steps below grade, too, to see the people walking up above us on the sidewalk. \u00a0The music was wallpaper.Service: C. \u00a0In general, the hostess was a little curt, and the waiter was pretty inattentive and almost rude (hey, it's French, right?). \u00a0There was apparently a snafu with another table while he was taking our order, and instead of saying something simple like, \"sorry, I'll be right back,\" or explaining anything when he got back, he just kind of walked away, then came back whenever. \u00a0Not a good start, especially since we waited a while for service anyway.Food: B. \u00a0Okay, here goes:--Escargot: Pretty tasty, but freakin' salty. \u00a0Good bread to dip into the remaining sauce.--Salad: I forget which one ... it had pears. \u00a0Amazing. \u00a0The Roquefort (?) was unreal.--Ravioli. \u00a0Also very good, though I wouldn't have thought to get ravioli at a French-inspired restaurant. \u00a0--Moules Frite: I couldn't finish the mussels, as they were too loaded with coriander to enjoy. \u00a0The fries were fine, though.--Roasted mushrooms: \u00a0Really nice, meaty, and flavorful, if a bit over-salted.--Beignets: Wow ... I would come back just to have these, after getting mussels somewhere else \u00a0(Central Kitchen, maybe)We also had a mid-priced Beaujolais, which was excellent--both fruity and precocious (come on, where's that from?) ...

We have had brunch at Gaslight before but for some reason had never checked out their dinner menu. When we arrived at Gaslight and made our way through the velvet curtains keeping the cold out, we opted to have a seat at the long, sort of u-shaped bar. As we expected, the restaurant was pretty empty, and we had our choice of seats. Gaslight is decorated like a Parisian brasserie with subway tile and dark woods, providing the perfect atmosphere to cozy up to your dinner date for a romantic meal or a good place to enjoy some of their fabulous cocktails with a group of friends. To start, we ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, and we both wished we had ordered more. They were ice cold, plump, with a briny ocean flavor and a spicy horseradish cocktail sauce for topping. They made me want to write an ode to oysters. I didn't have time today, but stay tuned, it might just be posted here one day! I also had a Fin du monde, a tart, very effervescent beer by Unibroue. For our entrees, the hubby ordered poelee espagnol, pan roasted cod with shellfish, chorizo and sauce \u00a0l'armoricaine \u00a0and I ordered the moules frites with pernod and coriander. Two perfect dishes. The frites that accompanied my mussels were served in a paper cone that was held in a little iron stand, and they were thin and crispy, done to perfection and a wonderful tool for soaking up the coriander heavy sauce. Coriander is one of my favorite spices, and I was delighted to find it both in the form of cilantro and seeds throughout. The mussels, like the oysters, were very fresh, plump, and delicious. My hubs' dish was bursting with flavor. I only got a bite because he gobbled it down, but the smoky chorizo paired excellently with the mussels, cod, and a big piece of bread to soak it all up. The service at the bar was great. We were very well taken care of but never hovered over, so we got to have a nice chat over our meals. Now that I know Gaslight has a great dinner menu and a charming evening vibe, I think we will become regulars, especially at their bar. Even if you don't live in the area, its worth checking out their website. Its like taking a tiny trip to Paris!Edited on 2/1/10 to add that we returned last Friday for another incredible meal. What really stood out this time, besides the food, was Gaslight's yummy, seasonal cocktail menu and the service! We didn't have a reservation, but they found room for us and treated us like we were the only people there when it was PACKED for a Friday night. The oysters were once again fresh and addictive, and my husband drooled over the ribeye special. I had the poelee espagnol, the dish my husband had the last time, and I almost licked the plate clean of each drop of salty, savory sauce.

Parisian crepes with duck confit and Granny Smith apples, pan roasted hake that was surprisingly subtle, and a delightful chocolate mousse gateau. The wine was an unremarkable house red, but hey, in Europe there's always cheap vin on tap. What pushes it up to 5 starts, though, is the service. Everyone is there to help, but they're not pushy or obsequious. The waiter was easy-going, the manager stopped by our table, and even the busboy offered us extra baguettes when we made a joke as he passed by.

I ordered the Goat cheese Beignets- this appetizer was pretty tasty, it tastes like a fancier version of fried mozzarella sticks.

There should have been some green like asparagus to accompany the dish. The dessert was just not good- the flourless chocolate cake- and I tried my other friends desserts-- \u00a0they were medicore as well the reason why I'm giving 4 stars is:The french baguette they give in the beginning is amazing- so warm and crunchy accompanied with whipped butter, couldn't get enough of it, we ordered more bread.

Rocca was a disappointment as a neighborhood \u00a0restaurant (it is more of a destination), but everything we heard about Gaslight offered more promise.We first visited several days after they opened and were offered a two hour wait for a table. Congrats to them. We made a reservation for two for the following Monday night. Even with a reservation, we waited 30 minutes for our table. Once we ordered, we waited another 40 minutes for a single appetizer. At one point, the waiter stopped by our table, and awkwardly asked if we had gotten our escargot. We smiled and shook our heads. He implied it had gone out to the wrong table. I don't tell the story because opening week service problems are surprising (at Rocca it was much, much worse), but they made no gesture to make up for the nearly lost appetizer or delays. I had the pork special, she had the steak frites. Both were enjoyable, but unmemorable. We both felt the fries were the least impressive we've had anywhere recently.Despite being less than overwhelmed with our first visit, we fully intended to keep giving it a try. We waited a few weeks and brought a party of 5 there early on a Saturday evening. They sat us quickly (without a reservation) at one of the long communal tables. We ordered a dozen oysters and some littlenecks to start and they were fabulous. Will definitely be back for more. The cocktails \u00a0- best prices in the South End, if a bit small - were also a hit. Two in the party had the Weiner Schnitzel and loved it, one had the steak special and thought it was very good. The lamb wasn't as big of a hit. I had the \"Confit de Canette\" - the duck - and found it fell well short of what I have had at both Pops and Petit Robert. The frisee salad didn't do much and the fries still taste like McDonald's fries to me.The meal was punctuated by one highly regrettable moment. My wife and step brother ordered deserts that came with Chantilly Cream. Each took one bite of the cream and stopped in their tracks. It had a strong savory taste. Savory... garlicky... perhaps even a hint of smoked fish? Not fun for desert. They correctly guessed, and the waiter confirmed after the dishes were sent back, that it was a creme intended for an entree or appetizer. He apologized and brought new dishes that they enjoyed, but that was the extent of the makeup for a pretty bad screw-up. We enjoyed the evening and laughed it off, but as on our first visit, they offered no comp, which would have been a good gesture.The interior is amazing, as others have noted, and it is a fun place, though it is thunderously loud and less than ideal for actually talking to your dinner companions. We will definitely be back and I look forward to both the service improving as it probably will and trying other dishes.

I am a typical guy who usually like the big portion for the best value. But every so once in a while you have to splurge, especially for a special occasion. Parking was definitely a plus. We made reservations for a 7pm dinner on a Friday evening, and was pleasantly surprise to find plenty of street parking at that time of a day. The restaurant feels and looks like a French bistro. We were situated in a small and cram-my table, nestled between 2 larger tables. They were completely trying to utilize all the floor space they can to fit in as many table as possible. Not the most comfortable seating arrangement. Service was fair at the very best. We did not receive one ounce of attention, despite the lack of customer at they hour of the evening. Nope, not once were we asked how our food was, if we wanted anything. Perhaps, just once she asked if I wanted another glass of wine. Other than that, don't expect any thing special here. Typically if I am going to drop 2 bills on a dinner meal for 2, I expect better service. Let's just move on to the food, shall we? The menu is completely in French and luckily my wife looked it up online before we went. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers, and 2 main courses. The cheese fondue was incredible and quite pleasant. However, the Escargot was lacking in flavor. It was bland and tasteless. I was hoping at this point the main course would make up for it. My wife had the Poele Espanol and that dish was flavorful. I definitely recommend if you like fish with a nice touch of cream sauce, flavored with Chorizo. Not quite sure if this is classified as a French cuisine, but what do I know. It just taste darn good. I had the duck confit and that dish was also wonderful, but definitely not the best I had. In fact, about a year ago I was on a cruise liner and they had a better duck confit. However, the highlight of the evening was definitely the dessert. We ordered the Chocolate Beignets and they were moist, with a chocolate creamy center (just like a donut molten cake). It was tasty and I would have ordered up another serving, but we were stuffed. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 stars, but Yelp only allow full stars, and no half star. I leaned more toward a 3 than a 4, so sorry. If the service was a bit more attentive, you would have perhaps swayed me to a 4 star. This is definitely a one time deal.

The place has the warm and unpretentious feel of the other French Brasseries. While owned by the Aquitaine group, its decor and vibe is strikingly similar to Eastern Standard, with a more subdued, less-bar hopping crowd. Service is always pleasant and prompt, starting with quick bread service - \u00a0a warm crisp baguette with a nice moist center. The menu is pretty standard brasserie fare:- Escargots - Came in a dipping worthy garlic and parsley butter. - Gaslight Salade - Beautifully presented and had some crack cocaine-containing lardons. - Virgin version of their Petite Sucre Cocktail - No idea what was in it, but really freaking good. - Pan Roasted Cod - Nice presentation, but I'm basically a sucker for anything that comes in a cast iron pan. Portion was just right. The cod was not really the highlight, which were the bivalves, which dominated the flavor of the creamy but not heavy sauce, perfect for more carb dipping. - Tagliatelle w/ English Peas - Nice texture, light.- Bar Steak - Perfect medium rare, with a wonderful savory flavor that penetrated the entire steak. The frites were thin and yummy, as anything fried and crispy would be expected to be. - Rotisserie chicken - Moist, hearty flavor.- Tagliatelle w/ Beef - Cast iron pan, super buttery, a shade too salty.- Haricot Verts - Crisp, light, perfect.- Summer Berry & Sweet Brioche Pudding - The mint didn't come through, the sauce was too thin and syrupy sweet and overwhelmed/sogged up the brioche. - Tartlett Au Chocolat w/ Peanut Butter Mousse - Lke a really really awesome Reeses with a super silky and luxurious filling. - Molten Chocolate Cake - Not too sweet, the cake is a little denser and has a little bit of a brownie consistency. I should have figured that it was not made to order when it came out so quickly with the other desserts and the molten part was not uniformly warm, I'd say it was still an above average version.Overall, a great date, family or large group place with food and service that greatly exceeds expectations for this reasonably priced and low key venue.

It could be better if people gave it a chance to work the aforementioned kinks out, and if the restaurant realized where it needed to improve. Sometimes I think people spend too much time comparing restaurants--or in some cases, comparing them to amusement parks--than taking in the whole picture. In my two experiences with Gaslight, I have found the restaurant pretty authentic in terms of its French bistro qualities. Yes, it is true, this is a *lot* like Balthazar or Pastis in NYC, but I certainly do not think it can be compared to Epcot. The decor and detail is anything but splashy, and the streetlights in the dining area are actually from Paris. And seeing as how Balthazar and Pastis have turned into more mainstream haunts now anyway, I think it is fair to put Gaslight in that same grouping, and unfair to hold those NYC restaurants up as bastions of cutting edge cuisine, to which somehow Gaslight cannot aspire. I've been to Gaslight the first day they started serving brunch, and about 2 weeks later for dinner on a very busy Friday night. I knew it was the first day they were serving brunch, and therefore was prepared for things to be a bit shaky, but to my surprise, our server was largely on top of things. He was a little slow towards the end in refilling our coffee cups and bringing our check, but nothing that would not be expected from the first brunch at a new restaurant.When I ate dinner at Gaslight a few weeks after having brunch, our server was very precise, and careful to check on us throughout the dinner. She was green, but earnest--making sure to double check all of the ingredients when asked about various dishes. I do have one complaint to lodge about the steak frites and that is that it could be a lot better. The meat just was not very good, and for the price, it really should be. We ordered a sampling of many other dishes, and everything was good, albeit ever so slightly unusual.

Sure enough, the adjacent lot is both convenient and free.The first thing that struck me upon entering was the sound--it's loud! The walls are lined with subway tile that really bounces the noise around. This is not necessarily a bad thing as there was certainly a lively vibe, but it's something people should know before they go expecting an intimate evening.My SO had the signature fleur de lis: parfait amour violet liquer, gin, white grape juice and champagne. She enjoyed it a great deal, and based on my sip, I had to concur: well mixed, with noticeable tastes of peach and grape to deliver the gin and bubbles. I, on the other hand, could not help myself and, much to my SO's disgust, ordered a $2 PBR. What other french brasserie in the city has $2 domestic suds? True, it's only 12 oz., but still. The one slip up on this occasion: the bar tender, no doubt unintentionally, charged me $4 for the PBR instead of $2. Completely by accident, of course. The discrepancy was quickly rectified when I pointed it out. The bar itself was a lovely: a french made zinc beauty, curved, just comfortable enough.Complementary bread is lovely: a warm, crusty baguette served in a paper bakery bag. A nice saltiness to the crust, and a moist, chewy interior.We started with the escargot and the tartalete. I found the escargot themselves a bit on the chewy side, but the broth was lovely: much less overpowering garlic than the usual, mild, with distinct notes of white wine and herbs. The broth was particularly exellent when soaked up with the crusty baguette.The tartlette was rich and fine, but nothing particularly interesting. Sort of like a twice baked potato in a flaky, mini pie crust. The truffles barely registered over the heavy taste of the roquefort and buttery potato.I've also since had the French Onion soup, which is OUTSTANDING! The best FO soup in Boston, and probably the best reason to go to Gaslight. Deep, meaty flavor, with bits of shortrib, and a perfectly browned cheesy crust; this is even better than the excellent version at Brasserie Jo, and makes the flavorless, liptonesque crap they serve at Bouchee almost inedible by comparison. For mains, I was talked out of ordering the cubano by my fiance, and we instead split the steak frites and the tagliatelle with braised short ribs and pearl onions.The steak was ordered medium rare, but the chef clearly knew better than I how this baby should be cooked. Not the thin, chewy hanger or flank steak that one usually thinks of with steak frites, the thick sirloin displayed some lovely outer searing, and, when cut into, revealed a wonderfully rare and tender interior. It was topped with a fresh tasting, herby butter sauce \u00a0that might have been a bit too salty (I will return to this theme). The steak was moist and tender, and really cooked properly for the cut. With less marbling than a ribeye or hanger, sirloin is best when cooked a shade below even medium rare: I think of it more like a filet than a ribeye. \u00a0Again, even with the great texture and tenderness, the one thing I would say is that the overly salty herb butter overpowered the flavor of the meat somewhat. The accompanying frites were limp and unremarkable: we more or less ignored them.The tagliatelle had a lot going for it: the short rib ragout was deep, rich, and full of meaty flavor; the tagliatelle was tender, a bit past al dente, but appropriate for the dish. The ragout was not really ragout, but just a rich braising liquid, making the dish feel more like a short rib bourgignon with noodles than a pasta dish (that's not a bad thing!); certainly the meat and the broth were front and center, and went just as well with the crusty baguette as the pasta. However, the chef definitely needs to cool it with the salt shaker. I don't mind salty food, so I was able to forgive the overzealous salination (especially with the sweet pearl onions acting as a counter balance), but my SO, who is sensitive to oversalting (she once sent back, quite justifiably, a $30 ribeye at ESK because of this very problem) was quite put off. I would give this dish another try based on the depth of flavor and richness in the ragout, but I hope word will get back to the chef somehow about the oversalting.For wines, we paired a glass of blanc de blanc ($8) and a glass of house white ($4) with the appetizers. The blanc de blanc was an almost perfect match for the escargot, \u00a0but I found the house white acrid and off putting. With the entrees, we shared a half-carafe ($11) of Domaine Houcahrt '04, which was fine if somewhat unmemorable (were we not driving, I would have preferred a full carafe of the house red for the same price).", "Date": "2007-12-12", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Sean E.", "ReviewID": "c512XvUn9IFLVBIpfR7DVw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Slammin'! \u00a0This is one of those rare places that you want to make plans for returning to as you're walking out the door. \u00a0Perhaps stopping by the maitre d' on the way out and setting up another appointment like you would with your barber or something.Located next to the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine and one of those places some people go to work out, Gaslight is a wonderfully designed place; very open and inviting, casual yet elegant. \u00a0The curved front bar itself is classy enough to sustain a couple of South End eateries.The most inviting thing of all is the prices and unique dishes the Gaslight has on it's menu. \u00a0I don't think there's one dish here that is over 20 bucks. \u00a0But these are all of a quality that many places wouldn't hesitate to charge in the low 30s. \u00a0We're talking about truffled scrambled eggs with grilled asparagus and slices of french bread for 9 bucks. \u00a0Holy jumpin' jeebus on a trampoline I had no idea scrambled eggs could cause my eyeballs to roll back in my head. \u00a0Oh and the bacon, goodness yes, the bacon... \u00a0Across the table I had a chance to get a bite of an amazing omelet with perfect texture and tangy cheese as well as more than a few frittes that were better than they had any right to be. \u00a0Oh, and the bloody mary was damn fine -- spicy, smooth and the definition of what you call an eye-opener. \u00a0Went well with the lemon tart we finished up with. \u00a0The portions are perfect too; just the right amount to satisfy.So yeah, we went for brunch and will be coming back for more before too long. \u00a0The mussels looked fantastic, gotta get one of those cool black pots they come in. \u00a0But really, go to the website, take a look at the menus and you'll see that there isn't one thing that doesn't sound amazing.", "Date": "2007-09-09", "Author_Location": "Berlin, Germany"}, {"Author": "Ravy S.", "ReviewID": "qdf_1UMuJhvtzPN0mcdUSQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my favorite French restaurant and I have been here two times!

For my entree I ordered skate with roasted potatoes. \u00a0Skate may not be for everyone, but I quite enjoyed it, and the roasted potatoes were exemplary. \u00a0Another dish I would eat any day of the week.Sarah ordered the bar steak and though she did enjoy it, the shallots in the dish came on a bit too strong for her liking. \u00a0The frites however were outstanding. \u00a0Do yourself a favor and get the garlic aioli for them, it just brings them to another level.For dessert I ordered the lemon souffl\u00e9 glac\u00e9 with sugared blueberries, and as is the trend, I loved it. \u00a0Sarah had the apple cake with caramel sauce and loved it as well. \u00a0Heck even the coffee cr\u00e8me we ordered was some of the best coffee ether of us ever had.The final rundown:There was a hiccup in the beginning, no doubt, but Nick and Gaslight turned a negative into a positive and earned a repeat customer. \u00a0In fact I cannot wait to take some friends and introduce them to some wonderful French cuisine.", "Date": "2012-07-11", "Author_Location": "Somerville, MA"}, {"Author": "Scott M.", "ReviewID": "v2XNNroz7aOSMfYRyGhMsQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been dying to go here for over a year now. \u00a0Well, to be honest, I have been here about 4 times....but last night was the first time I actually got to eat dinner there and not just enjoy drinks/dessert. \u00a0Let's start with the bar/drinks. \u00a0This is as good as it gets folks. \u00a0The bar area is elegant without being stuffy, and the drinks are fancy without being too 'la-dee-dah'. \u00a0My two favorites are the Edith Piaf martini and the L'Acolyte. \u00a0Both drinks are garnished with flamed orange zest, which OK, I'll admit, impresses me. I also enjoy a glass of Lillet Blanc. \u00a0I could drink here nightly, though be warned that most cocktails go for about $10. \u00a0Let's get onto dinner shall we? \u00a0The dining room is done with a lot of white, subway-style tiling and the wood tables, loud atmosphere and, well, gaslights are what I'd imagine a typical french brasserie would be like. \u00a0I had the Fromage Blanc as an appetizer, and though it didn't look appealing when placed before me, the ricotta, croutons and pickled veggies were delicious. \u00a0The bread also gets a big thumbs up. \u00a0For dinner I had the rotisserie chicken which was good, though not anything spectacular. \u00a0I know, I know....I always order the chicken dish and should branch out more, but it's what I like. \u00a0Stop judging. \u00a0That's my job. \u00a0Anyways, the fries that came with the chicken were perfection and quite possibly the best I've ever tasted. \u00a0When they were placed in front of me, my first instinct was to ask for ketchup, but I came to find that they were so flavorful, that I didn't need it. \u00a0I tried the bar steak and it was delicious. \u00a0I might well order that when I return. \u00a0We skipped dessert, but the chocolate beignets sounded tasty. \u00a0Again, next time....Our server was nice, but we didn't see much of him. \u00a0The staff seemed pretty stretched, and we rarely saw the same server twice in a row. \u00a0Overall, I give this place 4 stars for two reasons. \u00a0The first is that as previously stated, the chicken was really good, but not great. \u00a0Secondly, as also mentioned, the rotating group of servers waiting on us were a bit hard to get a hold of. \u00a0Both of these issues are minor and easily fixed. \u00a0I can't wait to get back here and go about fixing them!", "Date": "2008-12-23", "Author_Location": "Peabody, MA"}, {"Author": "Michelle A.

The moment we walked in, the hostess greeted us and was very welcoming. My boyfriend was wearing a NY Mets hat, and she commented about how she's a huge Mets fan -- how rare to find around these parts! Our waitress was just as friendly and was able to answer all questions we had about the items on the restaurant week menu (a lot of the words on the menu were in French, so I needed explanation on what exactly were in the dishes!) as well as suggest the perfect glass of wine when I asked (since I had no idea what to choose). The ambiance of the loft-like restaurant had somewhat of an understated, yet classy trendiness to it. Usually, I like sitting in booths and was initially slightly disappointed when we were brought to a table in the middle of the dining area, but I actually ended up really liking where we sat, as it looked exactly like the type of charming, two-seater table and chairs you might expect to find in a cafe in Paris... so it ended up actually being kind of fun to sit there and play 'pretend' in my mind.In regards to the food, the French bread was served fresh and warm out of the oven and was the perfect combination of crusty exterior (but not too ridiculously chewy, as some French loaves are) and softness inside. In addition, the butter was softened, which was great (I hate trying to spread really stiff butter onto bread). My salad consisted of mixed greens with a light walnuty dressing along with fried goat cheese, which was all very good. My main course was a tasty (but slightly salty) braised beef short rib (no bones) with gnocchi (which is kind of like European dumplings). At first, I thought the portion was kind of on the small side, but in actuality, it was the perfect serving size -- enough to make me satisfied, but not feeling gorged (most restaurants in the U.S. actually serve you portions that are wayyyyy more than you are supposed to eat). To top it all off, dessert consisted of creme caramel (essentially, flan) with passion fruit syrup and some nilla wafers -- quite delectable.", "Date": "2008-03-15", "Author_Location": "Ashburn, VA"}, {"Author": "S.Dumont R.", "ReviewID": "x6ilCuU_Bu1wU2BG3HTkAw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a certain weakness that comes to my knees when I think of French cuisine, simply put, I love it! So naturally I was very excited to try Gaslight Brassiere as per the mostly positive yelp reviews, and classic menu options.If you have ever visited Boston by car, then I need not tell you how quickly your parking tab will add up. So needless to say, when we arrived and found they were not only affiliated with the parking lot next door, but that parking was free, we were ecstatic. Since I am not familiar with the ins and outs of the city, I can't say I know much about the area, but it had this awesome trendy industrial vibe. The structure, like so many in Boston, appeared to have a few years under its belt, and that was just about fine by me. We made reservations for 6:00pm, and found it was a bit on the barren side when we arrived. The hostesses were very friendly, greeted us with smiles, and sat us at a booth by the window. Everything about this place screams fancy pants/casual, so if you're expecting a big fat glass of soda, think again. Since we don't drink we quickly turned the wine list down, so I can't say a lick about it; sorry. \u00a0As soon as we ordered, we received our wonderfully crisp mini baguette and butter. Something I knew I should refrain from eating, so as to keep the space in my belly as vacant as possible. However I was weak against its lure, and before I knew it I had found a home for that baguette between my cheek and gums.I ordered the Soupe \u00e0 l'oignon, \u00a0(French onion soup) and took a moment to revel in its beauty before tearing through it like a damn savage. The broth was heavenly, with little bits of short rib floating throughout. The gruyere crust spilled ever so slightly over the edge, giving me well needed reason to pick at its crispy goodness. My husband, ever the hater of appetizers, went straight for the entr\u00e9e with the intention of saving room for dessert. He ordered the roasted chicken with garlic herbed frites, and I the Saturday special; a luscious boneless shortrib sitting atop a fist sized filet of beef.By now, the number of diners has doubled, and almost magically, so I was glad I made those reservations! I managed to stop myself from tilting the soup bowl into my mouth, and even left some behind so I could enjoy my meal. In the short time we waited for our entrees to arrive, we played an unintentional game with the staff, who apparently can sense a sipped water glass like a bear at a buffet. Sip, refill, sip, refill, sip...well you get what I mean. When our food arrived, I took one glance at my plate and had a minor seizure, it was beauteous. If Jenga were made of tender meats, it would be the Saturday special. Below my carnal treats was a bed of garlicky saut\u00e9ed spinach and potato puree. The spinach made its way on to my fork more times than I had anticipated, the potato puree took a few rides, but not quite as many as I found it to be a tad on the bland side. Now to the meat, dear sweet Jesus was it good. The shortrib quite literally fell too pieces with even the slightest pressure from my fork. The filet too was ridiculously tender and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Although both were excellent I did find myself admiring the gravy boat of B\u00e9arnaise on another table, and wished I had ordered some myself. My husbands chicken seemed a tad on the dry side, which is why I never order roasted chicken, unless it comes recommended. Not sure what it is about chicken that seems to stumble even the most accomplished of chefs. The frites were delicious, nice and garlicky but would have been better accompanied by a well hydrated main.I was grateful when they took our plates, as I found myself staring down that last bite of steak I had left behind to save room for dessert. Enter the dessert menu; I knew better than to order the cr\u00e8me brulee as I am a notorious snob when it comes to custards of any kind. Perhaps their brulee would have been the brulee to restore my confidence in restaurants attempting this dish. However I had been burned so many times before, and so refused to tarnish my wonderful meal with such a possibility. I ordered the Gateau aux Pomme \u00a0(French apple cake) with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, and a caf\u00e9 creme. My husband ordered the chocolate beignets with cr\u00e8me anglaise.My coffee was divine, and though I probably should have refrained from dumping three sugar packets into it, I did anyway. The desserts arrived shortly after, and I knew I had made the right choice. The cake was delicious, very moist and just the right size after such a huge meal. The beignets were also good, but in my opinion not great, however they were not mine to love. My husband did comment on the portion being much to generous, and left most of them behind. I must also add that if you are thinking of traditional pillowed beignets, these are very different.

Lets start with location, deep in the cut of the South End on Harrison Blvd, there is actually a parking lot, no need for valet, you just pocketed 15 bucks. \u00a0Next the interior, of the restaurant is flawless. The \u00a0large nickle plated bar is set up like an old world French Brassiree. \u00a0 If you sit at the bar take note that it is not cool to the touch as it would be if it was bade of steel, I think it was pretty thoughtful, and indicative of the care that went into designing this space. \u00a0The main dining room is a high ceiling room which is also impeccably clean and beautifully tiled. \u00a0Not bad for a basement location. \u00a0The walls are lined with empty Pernod bottles in a meticulous fashion. \u00a0Enough about the interior, the food is amazing and not a single entree eclipses $20. \u00a0So as you can imagine the value is a real X factor for why I must give 5 stars. \u00a0If you like steak you have to try the steak frites first. \u00a0They use a Sirloin cut from the end I believe which gives it more of a chefs cat taste to it. \u00a0it is nice and thick while only being about 9oz, so you can order it rare and it will be nice and rare (thin steaks are more difficult to cook to rare). \u00a0The frites are thin and always fresh and the Bernaise is top notch. \u00a0Other standouts include but are not limited to mussels, croque monsieur and Onion soup. The onion soup here is made with real Guyere cheese and they even place a little piece of short rib in there \u00a0which reminds you that it is a beef stock after all. \u00a0The staff are always courteous, witty and efficient. \u00a0After reading an older review the Next time I go I plan to have one of the pasta dishes. \u00a0Also the bread is phenomenal and comes out warm in its own paper sleeve with fresh butter. \u00a0for dessert I get the chocolate cake of course, but my friends who like creme brulee say that its good too. The wine list, I believe, is pretty much all French labels. \u00a0For me I almost always order the house Cotes-du-Rhone, this goes well with the steak frites and even the onion soup because it isn't as heavy as a Cab. \u00a0Many of the wines are available in the Carafe and half carafe which is a great option depending on the night of the week.You can go to L'Espalier and get a phenomenal meal and also pay a descent price and thats fine for special occasions or for every day; if you have a heliport in your back yard - I don't. \u00a0For many of the regular people out there who just want a place for good simple French food with honest ingredients at a good value, this is the place for you.", "Date": "2009-12-02", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Kate P.", "ReviewID": "IzVXhmj2rwmdZSz05oCfGQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been twice and the second time was better than the first, so it leaves me with a positive vibe and therefore gets 4 stars over 3. \u00a0I have to give this place credit for having free parking and you get bang for your buck which makes choosing Gaslight over other Boston French restaurants a no brainer! \u00a0Go for brunch, dinner, or a drink at the bar with in appetizer, you won't be disappointed!", "Date": "2008-09-17", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Kate S.", "ReviewID": "dnVBM0k2w1N9isW-f2ue3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Atmosphere was loud and the wait staff was slow, but nice. \u00a0The food was terrific! \u00a0I had the skate and it was to die for!! \u00a0The place was happening on a Tuesday night, I can only imagine what a Saturday is like. \u00a0I would highly recommend making a reservation.", "Date": "2009-09-30", "Author_Location": "Dorchester, MA"}, {"Author": "Thomas A.", "ReviewID": "W3YYJSJFadYAZWjID1T7UA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really \u00a0looking forward \u00a0to having brunch last Weekend at the \u00a0Gaslight. \u00a0The decor \u00a0was authentic and beatiful \u00a0, we sat in the cafe and the the server was friendly and quick.

It is a vegetables I have yet to see in a 'western' restaurant until now, and they served the strands with the hard middle parts still present, which... are difficult on the digestive track. The Yorkshire pudding had specks of an herb, but I couldn't identify it, the taste of it more like a popover only.

The crostini were nice and had a good texture contrast with the meat, but when the crostini are the best part of the tartare, that's a problem. \u00a0And where the hell is my raw egg on top - that should be a given.The fondue was next. \u00a0It wasnt so much fondue as it was hot cheese in a pan. \u00a0They bring this pan to the table, and I'm thinking - is this Chili's? \u00a0Did we order Fajitas? \u00a0Fair enough, it was not fajitas and the cheese blend was quite nice. \u00a0The bread was fabulous and cutely delivered in a large paper sleeve. \u00a0We enjoyed that fondue, but before we had gotten halfway down our baguette, we noticed that it was no longer fondue, but fondon't! The cheese had coagulated and separated from the oil like a bad plate of microwave nachos. \u00a0Not cool. \u00a0We continued to pick at the cheese until it had cooled to the point of inedibility, then, awaited the next course.The salad, I felt, was almost pretty good. \u00a0Although not any better than any salad I've ever had, it was as it should have been. \u00a0The lardons I enjoyed, as usual. \u00a0The dressing was sweet with the roasted onions, but the greens were almost an afterthought and could not hold up under the stress of the additional ingredients. \u00a0I believe that a dish should stand on it's own ingredients and only play off the others if it works well. \u00a0Bacon is great, roasted onions are great, and a nice warm dressing is great, but together they were no more than the sum of their parts. \u00a0Suggestion: \u00a0Gaslight, add a bit of vinegar or something to the sauce to wang it up a bit - it was a little round for a salad.The pate was last on our little menu. \u00a0This type of thing is not up C's alley, but it usually suits me fine. \u00a0Pate was good, if not a little typical. \u00a0It was a little round and tasted more like bacon mousse than the campagne I'm familiar with. \u00a0The cornichons and grainy mustard were not piquant enough for my usual taste and didn't do much to sharpen the dull edges. \u00a0The pearl onions were tasty and a nice touch though. \u00a0Kudos for the portion of the Pate, though. \u00a0Decent, but not what I expected.The restaurant itself is quite nice. \u00a0The main dining hall has a great art nouveau vibe that lends itself nicely to the persona of the menu. \u00a0The staff had a pulse, that's all I can really say for them.Perhaps once it's been around the block a few more times, I'll go back and re-review. \u00a0But until then, if you want French, try L'Espalier or Ten Tables.", "Date": "2008-07-17", "Author_Location": "Jamaica Plain, MA"}, {"Author": "Laura T.", "ReviewID": "jfT8PyXYdeRqdPFekfUxlA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Two visits now and no need to go back -- the food is mediocre.

\u00a0We have pictures that prove that this particular little girl \"loves\" the chocolate croissant with the evidence all over her little hands and smiling face. \u00a0Or, you might order one egg and their heavenly, thick-cut, perfectly browned, maple-finished bacon from the \"Garnitures\" section ($4 for both, and you'll likely share the bacon). \u00a0Not bad for a kid's meal. \u00a0They do have hot chocolate, of course, but if you're little one loves juice, keep in mind that they have only orange or grapefruit. \u00a0Servings are very reasonable, and make for a solid meal. \u00a0If you're not fond of alcohol or gastronomic extras, you can certainly have a nice brunch for about $10, or you can up the bill with more interesting fare for under $20. \u00a0Honestly, this isn't the place where I would go in for lots of extras because the experience and food might not live up to the expenditure. \u00a0But I keep coming back, and after the Cuban sandwich (which I'm almost afraid to order again in case it isn't as good the next time), I feel even better about genuinely liking this restaurant, quirky foibles and all.", "Date": "2010-10-11", "Author_Location": "Dublin, Ireland"}, {"Author": "Tom D.", "ReviewID": "4gH1MYpeFTFRrGN1EH-a_w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To begin with a line stolen from my review of the Boston Common Garage, Gaslight is a suburbanites dream. \u00a0FREE PARKING at a restaurant in the South End?

This is a huge deal considering it's a high class restaurant in Boston. In addition, I walk into the place and I was just stunned in a good way. I can feel the energy and the ambience from the place and it was a great atmosphere. The way I can describe it was one of those cool French restaurants you see on tv or movies and its very elegant and romantic. I Saw different types of people in the restaurant and they were all dressed differently. Some were dress very proper and classy others were very casual. Same goes for the women that were there. And I saw families having dinner. So, there are different types of people which made it diverse. It was relatively busy. The host and hostess were very friendly. My girlfriend and I started with escargot, She has had them before but I haven't the escargot was amazing and very tasty. We both had some nice cocktails as well. The only downside to the drink menu is I wish they could have had more selections when it came to cocktails. But, there wine selection was extensive and had great selections. The service was great the waitress was very helpful and very friendly as well and check on us peridocally. Also, management checked on us as well and was very friendly and created small talk. For my meal I order the special. Unfortunately my memory is bad so bear with me. But, I had the steak and Mash potatoes. I was disappointed with the serving size. But, I realize that is the portion size in Europe. \u00a0But, when I ate it was scrumptious. The steak was medium well and the herbs and spices on the steak was rich. Despite the size I felt that the meal was very filling. \u00a0My girlfriend had the Salmon with French mustard. I tried a piece of the salmon and I nearly fainted. It was the best salmon I have ever tasted. As for desert I had the Lemon Souffle Glac\u00e9 with Maine Blueberries and my girlfriend had their artisan \u00a0cheeses with some fruits on the side. The Lemon souffl\u00e9 was unbelievable! It was rich and the blueberries were delicious.

They have a lovely drink list: cocktails with elderflower liquor and gingerbeer. mmm. But what really keeps us coming back for more is the food. Joel is pretty hot to trot on the steak frites - and if I'm not mistaken, Boston magazine rated them best steak frites for the price! ($19.75) Wait - or was that the Franklin Cafe. I can't remember - they're both great. I, myself, love their Duck Confit. It literally falls off the bone. So good. It kind of reminds me of Bouchee on Newbury Street, only sexier. They've got the french style menu, but it's not intimidating. Something for everyone. Rawbar, cheeseplate, great salads, great proteins.

We were seated on their lovely patio and unwrapped our silverware. I had an extremely dirty knife wrapped up in the napkin and quietly handed it to Evan, our server, who apologized much more fervently than was necessary, whisked it away, and then never brought me another. That whole meal, I never had a knife. I borrowed my husband's to butter some bread, fortunately didn't need one the rest of the time. \u00a0One thing I hate is a server who pretends to be oversolicitous but ends up neglecting you. This guy was like that the whole meal, never checked on us, disappeared for long periods. I had a good, albeit VERY strong cocktail flavored with peach and ginger. \u00a0My rock shrimp gratin appetizer was six or seven rock shrimp and some overcooked vegetables in a puddle of oil. \u00a0It was edible but not much more than that. Rock shrimp are pretty small and if I am paying ten bucks for an appetizer, I'd like to be getting more than an ounce and a half of shrimp. I tasted my husband's pear salad with Roquefort, and it was...some chopped pears, some watercress, forgettable dressing, and a few wads of cheese. For an entree I had the salmon. It was about three ounces of nicely cooked salmon on a pile of sauteed escarole. The whole thing was doused in some kind of very sour lemon sauce that complemented the salmon but made the escarole borderline unpleasant. Very sour AND bitter do not mesh, in my book. That was it on the plate too, I didn't even get a potato or a few spoonfuls of rice. Hey, so far I've had four and a half ounces of protein and a few vegetables. This is a great place to do the South Beach diet. I tried husband's bouillabaise, the plat du jour for that night, and it was tasty but so little seafood there it was borderline insulting for 26 bucks. Pigalle's bouillabaise blows this one out of the water. Daughter had six cheese raviolis in an oily mushroom cream sauce under a heap of tasteless peas. She's not a picky eater but she was unimpressed. Son, at least, loved his duck confit, and it was the only normal-sized entree portion on the table. I wasn't going to attempt dessert myself, I tend to cut my losses in mediocre restaurants, but the family was braver. Son had a well-made creme brulee and daughter and husband split the apple cake, which was decent, nothing more. Decaf coffee was good. I had to ask for a refill once we managed to get Evan's attention, and of course they had none available and I had to wait while it brewed. The bill was 160 bucks for the four of us, with two desserts and two beverages.

She came back a few minutes later to tell me she really didn't think the soda would come out well but suggested something else to drink, so I ordered a tea! That's problem solving, not bad service. Stuff happens.Appetizers- My mother got the escargot, which had a great garlic flavoring, but not overwhelming. I got the warm pear salad and it was delightful. I don't like dressing, so without the dressing the different lettuces and bits of cheese with pear made it very good. Also, the portions were good in that you weren't overwhelmed with a dinner salad as an appetizer.Meal- I ordered the ravioli and they were great! The cream sauce was just enough and the combination of kale and sundried tomatoes were a good mix. I tried my mother's chicken and it was very moist and the fries had a delightful seasoning, crispy. She ordered a couple of sides... the mushrooms, which were amazing, and spaghetti squash, which she said was good (I didn't eat it because I was already eating something cheesy).Dessert- She ordered the creme brulee and I got the gateau aux pommes. The gateau aux pommes was like an apple tart that came with ice cream and a maple sauce... divine! And the creme brulee was surprisingly large, not in a tiny ramekin.Overall, the atmosphere and food was excellent. I will be going back there again.

Check the definitions of the wines: Vin de Pays just comes after table wine quality. We wish the restaurant brings some quality wines on the list to make the clients happy.

It wasn't such a bad wait because there was space at the bar to grab a cocktail before dining. I ordered the Madame Lillet and loved it. Once we were seated, I ordered the croque-monsieur. It was light and perfectly cooked. The French fries are to die for. Thin, crispy and well-seasoned. The second time I went to Gaslight was for Sunday brunch. I made reservations, but there wasn't a need to. The restaurant was very quiet, I was seated right away and service was prompt. This time around I ordered the moules fr\u00cetes. I had to make sure I had those fries again! A large portion of mussels was served with them and they were made with pernod, which gave them a liquorice-y flavor. I'm not too keen on that flavor, but it worked with the mussels. My aunt ordered the steak and eggs and while she loved her meal, she was very jealous of mine!I would definitely visit Gaslight again, but the day and time would depend on with whom I'm going.

She said there was a table ready for me outside where I could sit and wait for my date, then sent me out to the patio host to get seated. Not so: upon speaking with this patio host, he told me there was no table and I couldn't be seated until my entire party had arrived. He sent me back inside to wait at the bar, where I had a tasty but strong grapefruit and gin-based cocktail (get it- it's good). When my date arrived, the inside host told us our reservation was outside and we could get seated right away (a familiar line). I closed out at the bar and carefully carried my still quite full martini glass out to the patio. When we checked in outside, though, we were given exactly the same run-around: although the inside host says \"your table is ready go check outside,\" outside host says \"nope I don't know what you're talking about; go back inside.\" This time the outside host informed us it'd be a 15-25 minute wait for a table, though, so at least we were making some progress. After already closing out at the bar, carrying my drink through the restaurant and out the front door, we were told to turn around and go right back where we came from. Fine, I get that tables aren't always ready when you'd like, but it seems like there could have been a much better way to communicate all this both amongst the staff and to the guests.Forty-five minutes later, we were still waiting at the bar and and hadn't seen or heard from any of the hosts in just as long.

Chopped raw seasoned beef topped with a layer of what I think was minced mushrooms and then a poached egg.

We've gone twice to the competition - the sprawling, brightly lit Brasserie Jo at the Colonnade Hotel on Huntington and loved it, nearly always surrounded by large tables of French speaking ex-pats. However Gaslight Brasserie, evoking happy memories of Soho's Balthazar, is simply more fun - a hopping place for late night dining with friends as long as hearing 50% or less of the conversation is not an issue. More important than the ambiance (I should mention that I have a soft spot for Brasserie Jo's European-hotel-style early-80s take on deco), Gaslight won me over with its stellar selection of wines by the glass, featuring a plethora of Loire Valley, Burgundy, and one of my favorite Alsatian whites. Both the Chablis and the Sancerre were magnifique! (Can't comment on the reds.) The restaurants' must-order item is the peppery Shaved Beet Root Salade, with toasted walnuts, watercress, red onion, dijon, and creme fraiche; the Gaslight Salade with lardons paled in comparison. We sampled the decent Pate de Campagne, and were pleasantly surprised when the waitress brought a crock of extra cornichons, and the escargot was as good as any we've had. The steak tartare, however, lacked zest- order it spicey. For our entree, we shared the sauteed skate, a bistro item we always order and wonder why it doesn't appear much on other menus. It beat Brasserie Jo's - more grilled, flavorful and less breaded, and if you're going to indulge yourself with a butter sauce, which I don't do often, the accompanying caper beurre noisette is well worth it!

of my favorites for good bar dining and relaxed cocktails/beers, but i forgot how nice it was for group dining until i went last friday for a birthday. \u00a0the seating was sort of awkward since we had 8 people, so they just pushed 3 tables together and stuck 2 chairs on each end. \u00a0there are round tables for groups of 4 or 5 and of course the typical small tables for 2. \u00a0dimly light, it has good ambience, good cocktails, and a decent selection of beer, wine and spirits. \u00a0the perks of eating with a group is you get to sample all sorts of appetizers that will otherwise be overwelming if it was a small party. \u00a0escargots are always good, nice and buttery and lovely with dirty martinis. \u00a0the fried mussls and steak tartar are ok. \u00a0mussels are delicate shellfishes to deal with as they can get quite dry and chewy if cooked too long and i feel like that is what happened to the fried mussels. \u00a0steak tartar was not flavored enough plus the meat carried an extra hint of fat which makes it chewy. \u00a0the best steak tartar i had was at lumiere, which i dont think is on the regular menu. \u00a0second best is at mooo. \u00a0maybe i'm just picking with my raw meats but most of the steak tartars i tried are very meaty smelling. \u00a0gag.they have a daily 'beat the rush' menu, which is restaurant week themed, but its ongoing and for under $30, whereas restaurant week prix fixe is for $33. \u00a0some in our group did the prix fixe but the normal prices at gaslight is so reasonable, there really is not much of a difference. \u00a0i had the steak frites which has always been my favorite. \u00a0cooked to a perfect medium, the center is warm and a flushed color, and most importantly, soft while the outside is a deeply seared color. \u00a0paired with the bearnaise sauce, its buttery texture slides down your throat. \u00a0i personally dont care much for fries, but i know good fries when i see it, and on my plate at gaslight, i saw some good fries. \u00a0they are skinny, crispy, perfectly flavored fries. \u00a0i tried the sauteed skate which was phenomenal. \u00a0the melt in your mouth goodness might actually create some rivalry with my usual steak frites next time i visit gaslight again. \u00a0never knew skate can be so good. \u00a0i should probably start fishing them at castle island in the summer. \u00a0also had the duck which is ok. \u00a0not a fan of confit and not a huge fan of sweet and tangy. \u00a0i have been looking forever to find a restaurant with dependably good, seared duck breast that is not in a sweet or tangy sauce. \u00a0not much luck other than at 51 lincoln so far. \u00a0any suggestions?to sum it all up, the highlight of the dinner was def the good company and the steak. \u00a0the good escargots, fries and cocktails thrown in were a nice touch. \u00a0we had dessert too, but its nothing memorable. \u00a0i just like the fact that they have creme brulee and thats why we all shared dessert. given the choice, their other stuff is so good, i'd give up dessert to save more room for the mains. \u00a0i def recommend gaslight and will take friends and dates here.", "Date": "2010-03-23",

The carte is full of French dishes and meals and has very little explanation, so a knowledge of French is useful. But be adventurous, try something new, and you may be pleasantly surprised. The prices are standard, so you won't break the bank. The drink options are eclectic, so you won't mind if you do. And the place is large, so even though it's always packed, it's just packed enough to be bustling without being exclusive (like Toro). They tried to recreate a french brasserie, which I find particularly patronizing given it's location in a new-looking building, but it still creates a homey atmosphere that, if you forget is trying to imitate a random Parisian bar next to an obscure metro station, takes on a city aura of it's own and makes it feel local and unpretentious without becoming a dive bar itself.

The server that came to clean off our entree dishes was polished less than a fast food server. Grabbing things and dropping them.Desert was surprisingly offered but still no second drink the server said Happy bday only when someone pointed out it was and he still didn't bring a candle on the desert.

The food was very, very good (though not the best french in town), the wine flowed freely, and the service had some definite high points. For example, I really valued the way that our server, who had brought out a molten chocolate cake for the table to sing happy birthday to me, noticed when I looked a little sad/longingly at the cake that I couldn't have (glutard here) and kindly offered to bring me a creme brulee instead. I very much value that kind of attention and customer service. Another very high point was the maitre d's willingness to accommodate our party, after I had checked in on our reservation 2x and he could see that I was less than pleased with the wait. However, this place only gets 4 stars in my book because of some issues I encountered (though this may just be my nitpickyness, fair warning). Knowing that a party of 9 was coming in for a birthday with a reservation, having us wait (all 9) at a very crowded bar and suggesting us to get drinks to wait when we obviously couldn't reach the bar irked me. Also I very much dislike having to wait after going through the trouble of making and confirming a reservation and hauling ass to get a group of 9 there on time (post-happy hour, mind you) to be told there will be a 20-30 minute wait. I understand its a smaller restaurant and hosts can only seat people once previous parties have left, but there is a way (and I have been a hostess) to know what reservations are coming up and plan the night out in a more efficient and smooth way. As a side note, it took one of my friends an hour and a half to get a refill on his water. So I guess I would sum up the service as they're good at correcting problems, but only once you have their attention?", "Date": "2012-11-04", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "polar p.", "ReviewID": "FBfGFtsgmDJ88QsIHV9FJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is probably one of my favorites in Boston. \u00a0Worth Every Penny.", "Date": "2012-09-10", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "stephen s.", "ReviewID": "ry_lD6jvTx3d0v3N49riMA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "really want to like this stylish new restaurant....however food has been uneven last few times i've been. and the size of cocktails and wine by the glass is ridiculously small.and with all that ugly white tile the place is too damn noisey!i found the staff friendly and when our waiter screwed up the order we were awarded both a carafe of wine and dessert. that made us happy.although i enjoyed my meals, they \u00a0were by no means the best for the genre....hopefuly that will improve. one night the bread was wonderful, crusty on the outside and nice and soft inside, almost like the great bread in Paris. however, the next time it was soft and chewy as if it had been left out in the rain! one dish was too salty, the fries great one night and awful the next, the onion soup too intense, the broth needs to be toned done somewhat.might be a good idea to wait a few months until the hype dies down and the food and service improves.", "Date": "2007-09-18", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "hilary c.", "ReviewID": "7zD5FOQDWxfIeuKWtbYgKw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, it looks Frenchish, some of the food on the menu is in the French style, but I wouldn't quite call it a French Bistro.

In fact, they treated us to dinner, which was so very nice and thoughtful. My daughter did extensive research, she wanted a restaurant none of us had been to, with a fun atmosphere and great food. This choice took care of all that and more. We made reservations, and were seated right away. The waitress was very helpful, making suggestions and answering our questions about some items on the menu. For apps we got a warm goat cheese/pear tart, very good! Raw oysters and escargot. So far, so good. My daughter and myself got monkfish, which was the special of the night, and we got the last 2 dinners. It was cooked perfectly, served with fresh peas and farro. My husband got a seafood dish that was very flavorful, and my daughter's boyfriend got scallops that he enjoyed. We all ordered dessert, and were very happy with our choices. One great advantage to Gaslight is the FREE parking, yes FREE, no valet needed.

We should have stayed there. Once seated, it was one disappointment after another, mostly due to lack of personality from our server and \u00a0food being brought to our table prompty. \u00a0We ordered a bottle of Cab and our server returned to let us know they were out. \u00a0I asked for a suggestion on another cab, and he recommended one twice the price, seemed annoyed that we were keeping him at the table. We ordered apps which came out before the crusty bread that I love reached the table. \u00a0We had to ask the food runner for bread. \u00a0Unfortunately, the cheese fondue we ordered came out of kitchen already congealed anyway- just not good. \u00a0The escargot was delish. \u00a0Next onto the entrees, my cod and shellflish had a nice taste to it but we had to send my bf's duck back to the kitchen, completey overcooked. \u00a0Our server never came back to ask us about our meals, I believe we gave the duck to a manager since he was MIA for most of our meal. The duck was fine the second time around but the sides were terribly oversalted. For dessert, since it was my birthday, we had a chocolate peanut butter tartelette, which was nice. \u00a0The restaurant gave me a strange photocopied birthday piece of paper in a sealed white letter envelope. The cold (and lack of) service at a meal that should have been a celebration and lack of quality food really made this birthday meal one to forget! \u00a0There are many great French restaurants in Boston and this is not one of them based on our experience on Thursday night.", "Date": "2010-06-19", "Author_Location": "Dedham, MA"}, {"Author": "EMILY Y.", "ReviewID": "-GtGedZRT6pc2ptC0JyO_g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love love love this place....never lets us down and we look forward to it everytime we visit from california!", "Date": "2011-03-23", "Author_Location": "Long Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Eva K.", "ReviewID": "fc_2dSXULn1XB_s90ZgGUw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I always have a fantastic dining experience here. Tonight in particular, the staff was attentive, despite being rather jam packed. I watched the maitre d' pay attention to how guests responded to where they were seated in the dining room, reseating a group that was unhappy within seconds. Our waiter left us alone when we were engrossed in conversation, yet was by our side as soon as we made eye contact. Gaslight saved our romantic evening out tonight, as I initially made a bad decision with a 7:00 reservation at the dingy and dark Estragon, and after our mediocre appetizers and completely tasteless olives in a martini, I called Gaslight to see if there was a table available. To our delight the woman on the phone said there was something available for 2, however their policy was first come first serve. Off we went down the road and in about 3 minutes were able to renegotiate our night smoothly. \u00a0Gaslight gave us extremely paletable food, good staff energy, aesthetic ambiance and cleanliness! We had the Salmon, and Lobster Tagliatelle. (FYI: French onion soup, escargot, arugula and mussels are also always good here.)
